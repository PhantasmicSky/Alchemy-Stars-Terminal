  "str_quest_chat01_20766004": "I like roses with thorns.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20766005": "If I was to decorate my room with flowers, I'd choose roses.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20766006": "Crimson red flowers are extra vibrant amid the thorns...",
  "str_quest_chat01_20767001": "I think I got more white hair lately...",
  "str_quest_chat01_20767002": "Oh, I don't mind that, just making an observation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20767003": "Do you think that's awkward, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20767004": "No, nothing like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20767005": "I think you have a unique personality.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20767006": "Unique? I like that term.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20788001": "Do you sink into despair at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20788002": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20788003": "Sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20788004": "The dark sky, the scarlet corona.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20788005": "Are you casting a spell?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20788006": "It could be the truth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20788007": "I realize I usually don't get what you said.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20788008": "It's very simple, really, I'm just describing a natural phenomenon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20788009": "And reminding you to adjust the course for Colossus accordingly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20788010": "Oh. Thanks for the heads up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20789001": "Darkness and silence envelop the land.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20789002": "That sounds rather depressing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20789003": "But the moon and stars shine brightly in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20789004": "Much better. I thought you were in a bad mood.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20789005": "I'm just used to thinking in the dark.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20789006": "True knowledge is the child of darkness and silence.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20789007": "What are you contemplating?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20789008": "About the nature and working principles of the world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20789009": "I'm lost already.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20789010": "Enjoy the night, it's the best time of the day for fantasizing and expectations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20853001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20853002": "Thank you so much for the breakfast. Life here on the Colossus is just so wonderful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20853003": "Huh? What made you say that all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20853004": "Hmm? You'd rather I didn't say such things?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20853005": "Not at all... I'm glad to hear it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20853006": "Well, it seems that book I've been reading holds some truth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20853007": "What did it say?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20853008": "To maintain a competitive edge in business, one must always maintain impeccable social etiquette.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20853009": "Erm... If you thanking me just now wasn't for the sake of etiquette...",
  "str_quest_chat01_20853010": "But was actually a heartfelt expression of gratitude... I think it would've made me a lot happier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20854001": "I hear you've recently been plagued with money troubles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20854002": "Uh-huh, but if you want to be totally accurate, I've always been plagued with money troubles...",
  "str_quest_chat01_20854003": "I have compiled a list of business books that you can take a look at when you have time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20854004": "Wow, if you're recommending them, I'm guessing they must be very insightful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20854005": "They're all introductory business textbooks, roughly at the level of basic parenting manuals.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20854006": "Parenting manuals...",
  "str_quest_chat01_20854007": "Yes, they should be perfect for your current level.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20855001": "I hear you haven't had breakfast today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20855002": "I'm just getting ready to go grab something.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20855003": "I'm feeling too lazy to move.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20855004": "If you find going out for breakfast to be too much of a bother, I can arrange for Frankel to deliver breakfast to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20855005": "I wouldn't want to put you out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20855006": "It's no trouble at all. All it takes is a shake of the bell.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20855007": "Thanks for helping me out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20855008": "It is only by helping others grow that one's own success lives on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20855009": "That's what my adoptive father Istvan once told me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20856001": "You still haven't woken up yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20856002": "I just woke up. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20856003": "I've compiled a report on the latest incidents to occur among the major forces.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20856004": "I'm sending Frankel to deliver it to you now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20856005": "Why are you showing me these?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20856006": "As the leader of an independent force, you'll definitely need it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20856007": "Perhaps one day you will rise above all the forces in the world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20856008": "But I don't have any plans to initiate hostilities against any of the other forces.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20856009": "Who truly knows what the future holds?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857001": "I have five meetings to attend today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857002": "If you have anything you need from me, it would be best for you to make an appointment in advance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857003": "Are you this busy every day?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857004": "I occasionally get the chance to relax.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857005": "I really want to see what you look like during your leisure time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857006": "I like to read in the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857007": "You mean those books about being a rational business guru?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857008": "Of course not. The exact opposite, in fact.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857009": "What kinds of books then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857010": "Love stories all about emotions and the pursuit of romance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20857011": "Well, that's a surprise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858001": "Didn't you sleep well last night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858002": "I saw you yawning over and over again in the restaurant just now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858003": "Vice recommended a novel to me, and I stayed up all night reading it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858004": "Vice recommended it? Is it a love story?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858005": "It is. How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858006": "Because it was recommended by me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858007": "Oh... Well, it's a pretty good novel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858008": "I really liked it too. It's rare that I meet someone I can share my interests with.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858009": "I'll ask my assistant to free up some time this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858010": "Come to my room—let's discuss this book in detail.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20858011": "Geez... You really don't have to be so formal about it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_20964001": "Good morning. Allow me to deliver the following report to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20964002": "We completed your commission a short while ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20964003": "Already?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_20964004": "Yes, as you gave us a limited amount of time to complete it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20964005": "But I also said it wasn't really an urgent matter.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20964006": "You could've taken care of it later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20964007": "When I take on an assignment, you can be sure that it'll be completed on time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20964008": "Maintaining credibility is one of the principles mercenary squads rely on to survive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20965001": "Good morning. Have you seen that butterfly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20965002": "Good morning. What butterfly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20965003": "I saw a butterfly in the corridor just now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20965004": "I think it flew in the direction of your room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20965005": "I didn't see anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20965006": "What a pity. It was such a beautiful butterfly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20966001": "Good morning. I see someone's set up an easel in the lounge...",
  "str_quest_chat01_20966002": "Right, that was Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20966003": "She said she put it there so that there're a range of facilities here to help everyone relax.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20966004": "So, that's it... Then I'll go ahead and use it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20966005": "Knock yourself out. I'm looking forward to seeing what you paint.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20966006": "If I paint an insect, nobody will throw it away, will they?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20966007": "Why would they do that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20966008": "Unless it's that really awful kind of bug...",
  "str_quest_chat01_20966009": "Haha, I don't think I paint something that lifelike.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20967001": "Good morning. May I ask when the Colossus will next be heading for Cloud Gardens?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20967002": "Why do you wanna go to Cloud Gardens?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20967003": "I've been thinking about that place ever since the last time I went there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20967004": "I discovered that Cloud Gardens is home to many beneficial insects, and even some rare ones.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20967005": "The entirety of Cloud Gardens is brimming with life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20967006": "I really like it there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20967007": "Hah, yeah. I like Cloud Gardens too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20967008": "I'll let you know in advance the next time we head there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20967009": "Thank you for being so accommodating.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968001": "Good morning. I want to talk to you about something.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968002": "I won't be going to the restaurant today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968003": "Why not? Are you busy today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968004": "That's not it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968005": "You're not a fan of the food in the restaurant?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968006": "This is embarrassing, but... It's a personal problem.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968007": "Last night, I had dinner at the restaurant and saw a certain dish—",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968008": "Fried insects.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968009": "Oh, right. That actually counts as traditional cuisine for some people here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968010": "I know, and I understand that completely.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20968011": "But I just can't get over it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20969001": "The sunrise was so beautiful today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20969002": "Did you see it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20969003": "I did, indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20969004": "I'm glad we got to enjoy the same beautiful sight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20969005": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20969006": "I painted what I saw.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20969007": "Are you any good at painting?",
  "str_quest_chat01_20969008": "Not really. I'm still learning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_20969009": "I bet your painting's as beautiful as the sunrise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21064001": "I received a message at noon—",
  "str_quest_chat01_21064002": "Lumopolis is to hold a month-long royal art exhibition.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21064003": "Huh? Will all the art on display be by members of the royal family?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21064004": "No, it's artwork from the royal collection.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21064005": "That's a shame... I thought I'd get to see the graffiti Carleen used to put up when she was a kid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21064006": "Don't make fun of the royal family.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21064007": "I'm not even joking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21064008": "Then maybe you shouldn't say anything at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21064009": "Oh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065001": "I hope you're already up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065002": "Of course I'm up, it's noon already. What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065003": "There's a light in the lounge that's been on all night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065004": "Really? How can you be sure?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065005": "I was browsing through my files in the lounge last night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065006": "No one came to turn off the light the whole night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065007": "If I wasn't there, that light would've stayed on the whole time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065008": "That is a bit of a waste. So, did you stay up all night then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065009": "Yes. I was searching for a legal precedent to help with the sentencing in a certain case.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065010": "I had to go through every available document in great detail.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21065011": "You're really dedicated to your job.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21066001": "I'd like to complain about the restaurant aboard this Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21066002": "Is that so? What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21066003": "Today's menu stated that coffee and tea would be served.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21066004": "However, in actual fact, only tea was available.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21066005": "Um... Maybe they ran out of coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21066006": "If that is the case, the menu should reflect as much, otherwise such negligence may lead to unnecessary misunderstandings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21066007": "I don't think most people would care about something so minor...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21066008": "Do you need me to list all the cases where neglecting even the most minor details led to disaster?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21066009": "Alright, alright, I'll go change it now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067001": "Did you eat at the restaurant for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067002": "Yep. What's on your mind?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067003": "Did you see my notebook there?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067004": "It's a black leather notebook with my name on the front of it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067005": "I haven't seen it, but I'll keep my eyes open.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067006": "Thank you very much. I'll go ask around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067007": "You seem quite anxious about it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067008": "Is it full of official Hall of Justice cases?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067009": "No, it's my private journal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067010": "So, it's full of private things you don't want anyone to know about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067011": "Heh... So, even the upstanding Pittman has his secrets.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067012": "It's essentially a journal of my travels and experiences around the world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21067013": "Gosh... Even your secret journal's boring.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21068001": "Good afternoon. Where did you buy the decorations for the last holiday?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21068002": "What kind of decorations do you need?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21068003": "Next week is Legal Week for the younger students at Dawn Academy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21068004": "The children will visit the Hall of Justice and learn all about the legal process.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21068005": "I plan to decorate the Hall of Justice with suitable, cute decorations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21068006": "Haha! I never thought I'd hear the word \"cute\" cross those lips.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21068007": "Ahem... I just don't want the children to be frightened by the solemnity of it all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21068008": "You don't have to go out of your way to find decorations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21068009": "I'll go to the warehouse to see what we have left over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21068010": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21182001": "The view at night from the Colossus's bridge is breathtaking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21182002": "Uh-huh, you're not the first person to say that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21182003": "I know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21182004": "But I don't think you really know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21182005": "Huh? Of course I know! I've lived on the Colossus for over a decade.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21182006": "But you always stay in your room at night and rarely come out to see the stars. Isn't that correct?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21182007": "Um, I guess so.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21182008": "So, do you really know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21182009": "I'll be waiting for you on the bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21183001": "It's evening already... Today went by so quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21183002": "What did you do today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21183003": "I finished reading a book this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21183004": "Then I went to a religious art exhibition in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21183005": "The entire exhibition area was empty. It was fantastic!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21183006": "I watched the sunset on Pompey's shoulder as evening approached.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21183007": "That really does sound like a full day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21183008": "You did all that by yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21183009": "It sounds a bit lonely...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21183010": "Not at all—I love doing things alone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21184001": "There are so many people in the lounge this evening.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21184002": "I guess no one's really had anything keeping them busy recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21184003": "I can't find a single quiet spot on this entire Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21184004": "How about the cafe?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21184005": "I just passed by there... There were only three or four people inside.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21184006": "Only?! That's a veritable horde!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21184007": "So, that's what you consider a horde, huh...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185001": "There are so many books on this Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185002": "Haha, if you want to read them, help yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185003": "I don't need to ask you for permission?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185004": "No, I'm not a librarian.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185005": "If you want a book, just take it and read it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185006": "Are you sure I don't need to tell you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185007": "There's no need.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185008": "Oh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185009": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185010": "How else am I going to get a chance to chat with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21185011": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186001": "How about an evening chat?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186002": "Do you enjoy group activities?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186003": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186004": "Why would you want to participate in such noisy affairs?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186005": "They sure are noisy, but they're a lot of fun.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186006": "Well, alright then... I'll join in and see for myself next time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186007": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186008": "Great, I don't like noisy group activities either.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186009": "Why don't we study cold weapons together?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186010": "I'm not really familiar with this topic.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21186011": "I know, but I can teach you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187001": "Pompey said he doesn't really like you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187002": "Huh? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187003": "I don't know. What could you have done to provoke him?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187004": "I secretly punched him...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187005": "How could you do such a thing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187006": "Huh? I thought he realized...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187007": "He didn't realize at all. You just foolishly implicated yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187008": "But surely your hand must hurt, no?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187009": "How could I possibly have provoked him?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187010": "Perhaps it's because you haven't offered to oil him.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187011": "Is that really my responsibility?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187012": "Well, I've already calmed him down for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187013": "He agreed for you to help apply some oil to him tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21187014": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21254001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21254002": "I hear there'll be a party at Colossus's restaurant tonight, correct?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21254003": "Do I need to prepare anything?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21254004": "Nope, I just ordered too much food a while back...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21254005": "So now I'm holding a party to keep everyone happy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21254006": "Hmm... So, there'll be lots of tasty food at this party, eh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21254007": "I guess I won't be having breakfast this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21254008": "Hey, you still need to eat something.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21254009": "I can't do that. If I do, I'll go over my daily calorie limit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255002": "I just did a little tidying. The Colossus is in perfect order now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255003": "Do you always start tidying this early every morning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255004": "Uh-huh. I really enjoy the process of tidying up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255005": "Organizing things in an orderly manner also helps to improve my mood.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255006": "I'm really lucky to have you aboard the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255007": "Good, I was worried that you might not like me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255008": "Why would I not like you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255009": "I perhaps care too much about the cleanliness of my surroundings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255010": "Sometimes, I feel like I'm a bit too much of a perfectionist...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21255011": "It wouldn't do you any harm relaxing a bit more.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256001": "Good morning, have you washed your face and brushed your teeth?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256002": "Not yet... Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256003": "Perfect—don't move a muscle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256004": "Huh? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256005": "I have something for you—",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256006": "A super soft towel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256007": "It's as soft as a cloud.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256008": "I'm sure it'll feel like heaven drying your face and hands with it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256009": "Oh, I really appreciate that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256010": "Well, I also bought a few for cleaning purposes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21256011": "I'm sure the Colossus would love being wiped down with silky smooth towels too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257001": "Oh, what am I to do...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257003": "I received a new request this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257004": "And now my plans are ruined...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257005": "Oh... An unexpected turn of events can really catch you off guard sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257006": "I don't even know what I should do now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257007": "I don't even have a moment to think...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257008": "Don't stress yourself out. Just stay calm and everything will be alright.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257009": "You can try taking a deep breath and reassessing your current situation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257010": "Then you can come up with a new plan.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257011": "Inhale... Exhale... Inhale... Exhale...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21257012": "I think it's actually working.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258001": "I've drawn up a calorie chart for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258002": "Huh? What are you giving me this for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258003": "Weren't you just saying at breakfast that you've been putting on weight recently?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258004": "I was just making conversation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258005": "I put a lot of effort into this chart.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258006": "It stats the calories of all the food you usually like to eat.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258007": "How do you know what I usually like to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258008": "I've been secretly taking notes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258009": "Sorry... You don't like me doing things like this, do you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258010": "I guess it's alright.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258011": "And I'm also a little curious about this counting calories business.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258012": "Maybe I can give it a try.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258013": "It would be great if it's of some use to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258014": "It seems a bit strange.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258015": "Sorry. I shouldn't have monitored your diet without asking you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258016": "I know you only did it out of kindness, but it feels like I'm being watched.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21258017": "I see. I won't do it again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21365001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21365002": "I'd like to recommend a fantastic new product to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21365003": "It'll instantly make your hairstyle the coolest do around!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21365004": "That's right, it's hair gel!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21365005": "If you wanna see it in action, come on over to the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21365006": "I even use it to shape my one-and-only trademark hairstyle every day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21365007": "I remember you having a really cool hairstyle, but I don't usually use hair gel...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21365008": "Hachi, did you dump a whole tub of hair gel on that thing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21365009": "How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21365010": "Geez, that's a wicked strong stench!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21366001": "Navigator, tell me about your dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21366002": "Why are you asking something like that all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21366003": "Pay no attention to him, Navigator—he got way too much free time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21366004": "I was just looking down at the world below from aboard this Colossus, and I guess something came over me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21366005": "Gin, do you still remember our dream?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21366006": "To save up enough Nightium to buy an airship and gaze down at the entire continent...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21366007": "That truly is an inspiring dream. I hope you make it come true very soon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21366008": "Thanks for your words of support.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21366009": "We still have a long way to go before we can make our dream a reality.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21366010": "So don't go wasting all our savings partying all night long, Hachi.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367001": "In the mood for a little lunch banquet, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367002": "Sure thing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367003": "Alrighty then, I'll go ahead and rally round everyone right away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367004": "I just know the others are gonna love this...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367005": "No thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367006": "Don't be such a wet blanket.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367007": "The Colossus is an excellent place to hold a banquet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367008": "The decor here has a classic quality about it, while retaining a fully futuristic sense of high-tech wonder.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367009": "Have you found any new business opportunities for us yet? All you ever do is indulge yourself in these flight of fancy every day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367010": "What better way is there to discover new business opportunities than to hold a banquet, right Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21367011": "Hey, keep me out of this. I don't know anything about anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21368001": "It's so hot this afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21368002": "Pick up your tongue, it's almost touching your shoes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21368003": "Hey, why don't you two try taking a trip to a seaside town for a short break?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21368004": "Just imagine that cool, soothing sea breeze...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21368005": "Yeah! We could even find a crazy beach party to go to!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21368006": "We can suck on mint lollipops in the sea breeze!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21368007": "Thanks for the great suggestion. We're gonna head straight to the beach right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369001": "Navigator, do you ever feel bored after lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369002": "At a loss for what to do as you watch the hours plodding by?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369003": "I'd like to introduce you to a mysterious creature guaranteed to change your life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369004": "It likes to have its chin stroked.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369005": "Just give it a rub and you'll be the best of friends.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369006": "It sounds like a real cutie.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369007": "Indeed, indeed! If you're interested, come by the cafe to find me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369008": "All it'll cost you is a mere 500 Nightium per stroke.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369009": "That's ridiculous.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369010": "Trust me, it'll definitely be worth every penny... We're talking about an extremely rare creature here!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369011": "A shameless swindler like the one I'm looking at right now... It's certainly a sight most could never hope to see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21369012": "By the way, I'm talking about Hachi, in case you hadn't realized.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482001": "Are you having dinner or are you in your room?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482002": "I'm in my room. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482003": "I just left something at your door.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482004": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482005": "The rose bushes I planted are blooming!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482006": "I picked a huge bunch of roses and piled them up on your doorstep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482007": "That's incredible, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482008": "But what's with that buzzing sound outside my door?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482009": "Let me go take a look.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482010": "Oh no, don't open your door just yet!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482011": "Why not?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482012": "It seems a swarm of bees had their eyes on those roses and followed them over...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21482013": "But that buzzing is so loud... Just how many bees are out there?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483001": "Hya! Hya!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483002": "I finally did it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483003": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483004": "After a full day's hard work, I've finally learned a new baking recipe!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483005": "Ta-da!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483006": "Honey cake!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483007": "It took me a whole day of baking to finally come up with something edible. It sure wasn't easy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483008": "It's perfect for a late night snack.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483009": "Then I'll come and deliver it to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483010": "Sounds good to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483011": "Heeheehee! Finally foisted this cake...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483012": "Huh? I'm getting a bad feeling about this, right in my stomach...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483013": "You didn't put anything weird in it, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483014": "No...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483015": "No, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483016": "You should enjoy it yourself. You worked so hard to make it, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483017": "But I don't want to eat it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483018": "Since when have you ever said no to cake?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483019": "Well... there wasn't any honey left, so it's not sweet at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483020": "Judging by your definition of \"not sweet,\" I'm guessing it's just right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21483021": "Alright, I'm coming to destroy that thing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484001": "Aiee! This is just too much!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484002": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484003": "I saw these two absolutely to-die-for miniskirts the day before yesterday, and now I don't know which one to choose.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484004": "I've been pulling my hair out over it for two days now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484005": "There's this red one with lots of ribbons—it's super cute.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484006": "Then there's this blue one that's soft as a cloud, with a huge bow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484007": "Which one do you think would look good on me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484008": "The red one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484009": "Um... But I already have so much red in my wardrobe.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484010": "If you put together a nice color-coordinated outfit, you might be able to create your own personal style.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484011": "The blue one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484012": "Um... But I don't know if blue looks good on me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484013": "How will you ever know unless you give it a try?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484014": "Wow. You might have a point there!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21484015": "Heeheehee! Then I'll buy this one!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21485001": "Stranger, let's go out and have some fun!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21485002": "What, right now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21485003": "It's late, you should get some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21485004": "But I can't sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21485005": "So, you can't get to sleep sometimes too, eh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21485006": "I accidentally ended up sleeping all day, and just woke up...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21485007": "That's some accident...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486001": "I'm mad!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486002": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486003": "I was organizing my wardrobe just now and ran into a huge problem!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486004": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486005": "I don't have any clothes to wear!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486006": "Don't you have like... a million cute little miniskirts to wear?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486007": "Heeheehee! You really think my skirts are cute?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486008": "Yeah, and they all really suit you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486009": "Haha! Alright, then, I'll set a dozen of them aside to hang onto.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486010": "A dozen...? And you say you don't have anything to wear...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486011": "Oh poo... Why does it still feel like I don't have that one perfect skirt in my collection I love more than all the rest?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21486012": "I have a feeling you'll always be chasing that one perfect skirt.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21487001": "Have you had your dinner?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21487002": "I'm just getting ready to go to the restaurant.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21487003": "Don't go to the restaurant—let's go eat at the coffee shop!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21487004": "They only have sweet stuff in the coffee shop.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21487005": "That's right, they've got the sweetest, scrummiest cakes there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21487006": "It's not healthy to only eat desserts all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21487007": "But \"real food\" is so icky, and cakes are the best!",
  "str_quest_chat01_21563001": "Wow, the sun's so bright today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21563002": "I was decorating my room with flowers and tea, and couldn't help but think of you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21563003": "Would you like to come to my room for a cup of tea and enjoy this beautiful day with me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21563004": "That sounds delightful. I'll be right over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21563005": "We can enjoy the flowers while we discuss the meaning of life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21563006": "The meaning... of life...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21563007": "I suddenly remembered there's something I've gotta do right now, I don't think I can come over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21563008": "What is it that you need to do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21563009": "Hello...? Signal...bad...cutting...out...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21564001": "I love watching bunnies frolicking in the sunlight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21564002": "Especially when they're wearing my tailor-made outfits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21564003": "You made some new clothes for those rabbits?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21564004": "They're such lucky bunnies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21564005": "If I didn't know better, I'd say you were jealous of my bunnies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21564006": "If you really want to be a little bunny too, I'll design an adorable outfit just for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21564007": "If you will it, it is no dream...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21565001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21565002": "On this sunny afternoon, I'd like to issue you an invitation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21565003": "A grand ceremony will take place soon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21565004": "At the Winter Palace, we shall convene to confer our warmest wishes upon Queen Bethlehem.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21565005": "I wish to invite you to witness this solemn and sacred moment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21565006": "I-I'm honored and grateful that you'd invite me to such an important event.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21565007": "But I'm not from Northland... Am I even allowed to attend a ceremony like that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21565008": "Of course, you're the last Caelestite, an esteemed guest of the royal court.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21565009": "Your presence would be a great honor for us. We look forward to your visit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21565010": "This is all so formal... My palms are already sweating...",
  "str_quest_chat01_21566001": "It's already noon, but there's still not much sunlight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21566002": "It's a bit cloudy today, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21566003": "The sunlight's being blocked out. This is a bad omen.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21566004": "It's not all doom and gloom, it's just the way the weather is sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21566005": "It's good to hear you say such insightful words.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21566006": "It indicates that your soul has not yet been obscured by the overshadowing haze, but is still a bright spot in the universe.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21567001": "Thank you for your continued inspiration. I have designed a new set of accessories thanks to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21567002": "I've named this set of accessories—Afternoon Rose.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21567003": "Huh? How did I inspire you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21567004": "Just now in the hallway, I saw you talking to a girl.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21567005": "The way the sun was shining on you, it was like a dream.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21567006": "That spark of magic that exists only in the subtle interactions of youthful souls moved me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21567007": "And so, I designed this Afternoon Rose set.",
  "str_quest_chat01_21567008": "What spark of magic are you talking about...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_21567009": "Vice was just nagging me to finish compiling this month's income and expenditure statement...",

  "str_quest_chat01_22165007": "Wait... Was this light meal accompanied by a heavy drinking session?",

  "str_quest_chat01_22166007": "You're cooking?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22166008": "Yes, it's one of my rare days off, so I got everything ready myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22166009": "Tender slabs of meat, glazed with a rich, spicy sauce. It's all very delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22166010": "Wow... My mouth's watering just thinking about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22166011": "Oh, I'll send some over to you now, then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22167001": "Oh no, I've missed lunchtime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22167002": "Been busy today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22167003": "Yes, I was just repairing an ancient relic and lost track of time.",

  "str_quest_chat01_22168001": "PlayerName, can I ask you something?",

  "str_quest_chat01_22168003": "If Officer Gronru comes looking for me, could you please tell her I'm not here?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22168004": "Sure, but why are you avoiding her?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22168005": "Because I don't have much work to do this afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22168006": "So, you don't want Gronru to come looking for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22168007": "Officer Gronru will definitely try roping me into playing games with her.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22168008": "Oh, heh... You're right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22168009": "I'm really not interested in games, so please help me to stop her before she gets a chance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22168010": "Sure, don't worry about a thing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22168011": "But I think she'll probably end up dragging me away for a gaming session...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22283001": "Just now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22283002": "The dark sky suddenly flashed with light.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22283003": "Was it lightning? Is it going to rain?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22283004": "No, it must've been some kind of message from the divine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22283005": "It signifies that the old order is about to be broken.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22283006": "Now that you mention it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22283007": "You have also noticed something astir in the cosmos, no?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22283008": "I suddenly remembered something...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22283009": "I forgot to bring in the clothes I put out to dry!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284001": "I feel so energized.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284002": "It's rare to hear you say that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284003": "Candy is so delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284004": "You're eating candy this late at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284005": "It's the only way to keep one's brain receptive to messages from above.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284006": "Just remember to brush your teeth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284007": "Why should I brush my teeth?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284008": "After brushing them, I'll just eat some more candy. Wouldn't that be a waste of time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284009": "Don't eat candy after brushing your teeth, then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284010": "What has the great unknown shown you tonight?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284011": "That you forgot to brush your teeth today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22284012": "Oh, you're actually right about that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22285001": "It's getting dark, but it's not dark enough just yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22285002": "Huh? What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22285003": "Wait until the early morning, when there's no one else around and you're all alone...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22285004": "Come quietly to my room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22285005": "Huh? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22285006": "I will reveal to you a secret of epic profundity—",
  "str_quest_chat01_22285007": "The truth about the origin of the Aurorians.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22285008": "How did you find this out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22285009": "I saw a video on the truth about the origin of the Aurorians.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22285010": "That was just a movie... I've already seen it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286001": "This could be very dangerous.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286002": "Huh? What could be?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286003": "My identity may have been exposed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286004": "Uh, you're a member of the Lumo Knights. Is that it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286005": "No, someone has discovered the fact that I'm one of the awakened.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286006": "Huh? Who?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286007": "I watched a magical show this evening, but there was not a single person in the audience.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286008": "The magician performed various magical feats—so powerful, in fact, that he must have been an alien visitor.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286009": "It's just magic... You know it's all fake, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286010": "And he kept his eyes on me the entire time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286011": "That's because you were the only person in the audience...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286012": "He must have seen right through my facade. I must leave—I need to lay low for a while.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22286013": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287001": "And just like that, night has fallen once again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287002": "Busy day?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287003": "After a day of searching for information, I now have sufficient evidence in my possession—",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287004": "Evidence that Lumopolis is under the total control of the God of Light.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287005": "Huh? What evidence?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287006": "Lumopolis falls into darkness at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287007": "Well, everywhere falls into darkness at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287008": "Right, this is what scares me most.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287009": "The God of Light has taken over the entire continent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287010": "And those who discover the truth will be cursed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287011": "I think I know what this curse might be...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287012": "Those who discover the truth fall into a deep sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287013": "Yes. How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22287014": "Alright, I'm done. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22363001": "Hey, are you hungry?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22363002": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22363003": "I just ate a while ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22363004": "A little, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22363005": "I didn't realize it was already time for lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22363006": "Just make sure to eat your fill, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22363007": "Otherwise, your body won't be able to keep up with all your adventures!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22364001": "Speaking of, care to go on a little adventure with me in a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22364002": "I heard about a place with beautiful scenery, and I'm dying to check it out!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22364003": "Sorry, but I already have plans for today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22364004": "Is that right? What a pity...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22364005": "I'm not exactly thrilled about it either...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22364006": "Guess I'll have to invite you sooner next time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22364007": "I didn't realize you were so popular, PlayerName! I should work on that as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22364008": "I-It's not like that at all, Ruby! It's just a coincidence, I swear...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22365001": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22365002": "Good afternoon, Ruby.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22365003": "Bently and Lompty say hi too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22365004": "Good afternoon, you guys!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22365005": "They nodded in response just now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22365006": "H-Hey! Bently, Lompty, get your butts back here!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22366001": "Lalala! Doo-bee-doo-bee-daaah!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22366002": "You look like you're in a good mood today, Ruby.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22366003": "Yup!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22366004": "Whenever I hear one of Barbara's songs, I can't help but cheer up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22366005": "That's the power of music!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22366006": "I just wish I knew when her next song is supposed to drop!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22367001": "Hey, are you hungry?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22367002": "Wanna try some charcoal-grilled sandworm meat?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22367003": "N-No, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22367004": "Won't that upset your stomach?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22367005": "I don't think I can handle eating something like that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22367006": "Suit yourself! But I gotta say, you're really missing out!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22367007": "You'll just have to wait until next time to try it, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22368001": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22368002": "Good afternoon, Ruby!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22368003": "I have a new place to explore later today, so I'm gonna take a nice long nap before I head out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22368004": "Can't be too tired if you want to go adventuring!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22368005": "Agreed. Enjoy your nap!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22368006": "Thanks! It won't be long before I... Doze off... Zzzzzz...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22482001": "Don't stay up too late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22482002": "Are you still working?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22482003": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22482004": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22482005": "What about you, Florine?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22482006": "I already finished my work for the day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22482007": "Whenever I have free time in the evenings, I like practicing my sword technique.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22482008": "Speaking of, I should really get started. Talk to you later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22483001": "Alba seems really depressed today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22483002": "Do you think it's sick?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22483003": "You can tell if a snake looks depressed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22483004": "Of course I can. No one knows Alba better than me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22483005": "Whenever Alba's excited, it stands up straight and looks off into the distance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22483006": "But now it's hiding from me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22483007": "Maybe you should take Alba to see a vet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22483008": "What do you say, Alba? Should we go see a doctor?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22483009": "It's coming out now... Hmmm, and shaking its head?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22483010": "It looks like Alba doesn't want to go to the doctor's...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22484001": "Have you eaten dinner yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22484002": "Yep!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22484003": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22484004": "I made my own dinner tonight, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22484005": "I really enjoy cooking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22484006": "If you were here right now, you could try some of my cooking too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22484007": "Seriously? Looks like I'm missing out, huh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22484008": "It's fine. There'll be plenty of chances later on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22485001": "When I'm investigating heretic civilizations during the day, there's always a chance that I'll overlook something.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22485002": "That's why I review all of my work every night before bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22485003": "Just to make sure I'm not missing anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22485004": "You really take your job seriously, Florine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22485005": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22485006": "My work is what gives my life meaning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22486001": "Don't stay up too late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22486002": "Get some rest soon, so that you'll have enough energy to face tomorrow's challenges.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22486003": "Thanks for the reminder, Florine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22486004": "I'll go to bed in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22486005": "I'm just glad to hear that you take my advice to heart.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22486006": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22487001": "I'm reading a new book right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22487002": "It's about the rise of ancient civilizations, as well as theories regarding their destruction...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22487003": "Although we know very little about how these civilizations came to be—",
  "str_quest_chat01_22487004": "One thing is certain: their legacy continues to pose a threat to the world today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22487005": "This book sounds pretty intense...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22553001": "You're up early today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22553002": "Yeah, I got up pretty early today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22553003": "Huh, guess you're not as lazy as I thought.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22553004": "Is that how you think of me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22553005": "I've never been lazy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22553006": "Besides, getting up early isn't that big of a deal, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22553007": "Oh yeah? Then let me rephrase that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22553008": "Guess you're... Quite the hard worker, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22554001": "I haven't been able to find Ruby all morning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22554002": "Where could she be?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22554003": "Have you tried going to her usual spots?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22554004": "Of course I have.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22554005": "Ugh, I should've known you'd be of no use to me. Guess I'll just have to keep searching on my own.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22554006": "Ruby—",
  "str_quest_chat01_22555001": "Ugh... So sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22555002": "You're still not up, Rouge?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22555003": "That's not it. I'm tired because I got up too early...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22555004": "But I can't afford to slack off today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22555005": "I should just take the extra time to sharpen my Blazing Epee!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22556001": "I just sneezed really hard.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22556002": "You're not bad-mouthing me right now, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22556003": "Of course not!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22556004": "Heehee, I'm only joking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22556005": "Oh! Sorry for jumping the gun, Rouge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22556006": "You know, sneezing has another meaning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22556007": "But you wouldn't understand, so never mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22557001": "You're up early today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22557002": "Did you eat breakfast yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22557003": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22557004": "Yep!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22557005": "You won't get taller if you don't eat breakfast, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22557006": "I'm pretty sure you still have some room to grow, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22557007": "So remember to eat a decent breakfast every morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22663001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22663002": "Have you eaten lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22663003": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22663004": "Yep!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22663005": "What about you, Rinne?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22663006": "Yes, I have. Thank you for your concern.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22663007": "I had a delightful and aromatic vegetarian meal today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22663008": "The delicious, natural taste filled me with boundless energy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22663009": "Wow, you made it sounds so delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22664001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22664002": "Afternoons are when we are at our most energetic.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22664003": "Remember to spend your time wisely and productively.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22664004": "Sure thing! I'll do my best to knock out all of my work today!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22664005": "I'm glad to hear you say so, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22665001": "You're always welcome to chat with me if you have nothing else to do, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22665002": "What's up, Rinne? Feeling bored?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22665003": "As expected, you saw right through me, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22665004": "A priestess' life is simple and uneventful, so I usually sweep the temple courtyard or go for a walk whenever I have free time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22665005": "Your life of adventure is far more interesting, I imagine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22665006": "Hey, everyone has their own way of living.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22665007": "Besides, your life sounds pretty nice too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22666001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22666002": "Whoa, afternoon already?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22666003": "No wonder I feel a little sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22666004": "You must not have gotten enough sleep last night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22666005": "Please try to get more rest, Navigator. Your health is very important.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22667001": "Do you enjoy visiting places of natural beauty, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22667002": "Of course I do!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22667003": "I actually prefer the city.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22667004": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22667005": "For a priestess, nature's beauty is not only deserving of appreciation, but reverence as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22667006": "From the tallest mountains to the smallest flowers, our gods reside in every corner of nature...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22668001": "I think about that city from time to time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22668002": "Though my life as a priestess is one of peace and tranquility, my roots still lie in that place.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22668003": "A place where my memories still reside.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22668004": "Even though I managed to return to the Cloud Gardens...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22668005": "I still know exactly how you feel, Rinne.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22668006": "I'm comforted by your understanding, Navigator. Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22752001": "Morning. Are you awake?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22752002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22752003": "Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22752004": "Oh... I'm not disturbing your rest, am I?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22752005": "I knew it was wrong to wake up this early.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22752006": "I... I think I'll just go back to sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22753001": "The sun... It's shining on my window sill.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22753002": "Heheh, how wonderful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22753003": "Are you sure you're talking about the sunlight, Kayano?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22753004": "You make it sounds like something quirky...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22753005": "Sunlight... Quite an interesting light, indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22753006": "Though I much prefer the light of the moon...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22754001": "Morning. Are you awake?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22754002": "Just got up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22754003": "It's still... very early.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22754004": "You woke up much earlier than I was, Kayano.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22754005": "Yes, but only because I didn't sleep last night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22754006": "I was playing a game with THEM all night long.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22755001": "Listen, the sound of the morning dew falling to the ground.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22755002": "I don't hear anything over here...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22755003": "You must have really good hearing, Kayano!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22755004": "Oh... Your praise is most appreciated.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22755005": "Sounds like this are easy to perceive if you focus on them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22756001": "Have you eaten breakfast yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22756002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22756003": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22756004": "Well... I haven't.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22756005": "But I don't feel hunger...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22756006": "I'm watching THEM eat right now, so I thought I should ask.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22756007": "Good thing that I can't see them...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22853001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22853002": "Good morning, Amemori!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22853003": "Have you freshened up for the day yet, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22853004": "Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22853005": "Really? Is there a specific reason for that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22853006": "I, uh... I woke up late, that's all. I'll go wash up right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22854001": "The light of dawn glows softly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22854002": "Now is the perfect time to carry out missions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22854003": "What? This early?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22854004": "A ninja's work is best carried out when the rest of the world slumbers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22854005": "As a proud ninja, I must make good use of this time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22855001": "With the dawn comes... A bath.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22855002": "My preparations are complete.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22855003": "Do you usually take a bath first thing in the morning, Amemori?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22855004": "Only because my duties as a ninja demand it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22855005": "Even if I only stay somewhere for a single night—",
  "str_quest_chat01_22855006": "The scent of my surroundings will linger on me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22855007": "For a ninja, stealth is of the utmost importance. I can't afford to let anything reveal my presence, including my smell.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22856001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22856002": "Are you awake?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22856003": "I've been up for a while.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22856004": "I'm just thinking about what to do today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22856005": "I just got up...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22856006": "I'm still a little sleepy, though.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22856007": "Your life seems... rather carefree.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22856008": "I can only hope to live such an unrestrained and leisurely life someday...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22857001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22857002": "Morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22857003": "You seem to be in high spirits, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22857004": "Yeah, I feel great today!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22857005": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22857006": "Knowing that you're in such a good mood... It helps to put my mind at ease.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22857007": "You really should try to relax more, Amemori.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22857008": "... A worthy ninja must always remain vigilant.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22858001": "I have a very urgent matter to attend to today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22858002": "Though the schedule is quite tight, I believe I should still make time to talk to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22858003": "It'll also help to keep me focused on my mission.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22858004": "So what exactly is this urgent matter, Amemori?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22858005": "A top-secret mission, the details of which I cannot share with anyone, even you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22858006": "However, there's a brand-new shop on the island, which is rumored to sell all kinds of interesting items...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22858007": "I wish to use this opportunity to update and restock my personal inventory.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22858008": "It seems you're more concerned about shopping than your mission itself...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22858009": "Hmm... You appear to be right, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22964001": "Mmm... I'm hungry...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22964002": "I'm absolutely famished...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22964003": "What should I eat today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22964004": "Steamed buns!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22964005": "Salad!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22964006": "Hmm... But I'm not in the mood for light fare!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22964007": "I need something spicy and savory! Like... Like super spicy braised tofu!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22964008": "It sounds like you already know what you want to eat...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22964009": "Heehee!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22965001": "The weather's fantastic today!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22965002": "Perfect for some martial arts training!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22965003": "That settles it! I'm giving myself until sundown to complete my mission!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22965004": "Mission? What mission, Yao?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22965005": "Oh, just a little training mission I gave myself: two-hundred kicks and two-hundred punches before the sun sets!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22965006": "Try not to overdo it, okay...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22966001": "Mmm... I'm hungry...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22966002": "And I just had lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22966003": "Do you think it's because I have a fast metabolism or something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22966004": "Actually, I think it has something to do with how hard you train all the time...",
  "str_quest_chat01_22966005": "Yeah, you're right!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22966006": "Looks like I'll have to eat an even bigger lunch now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22967001": "Hiya!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22967002": "The secret to controlling your Qi lies in—",
  "str_quest_chat01_22967003": "Your stamina!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22967004": "If you're gasping for breath after fifty push-ups, you still have a long way to go!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22967005": "What?! Fifty push-ups still aren't enough for you?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22967006": "Not by a longshot!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22968001": "Do you think qipao dresses are pretty, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22968002": "Of course they are!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22968003": "Dresses are all the same to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22968004": "Why do you ask, all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22968005": "Someone told me that a warrior shouldn't wear a flowery qipao into battle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22968006": "Hmph, what a joke!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22968007": "Can you really call yourself a warrior if you can't even choose your own clothes?",
  "str_quest_chat01_22968008": "I totally agree!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22969001": "Ying gave me this really pretty hairpin.",
  "str_quest_chat01_22969002": "Ah, it's so beautiful!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22969003": "Ying must really care about you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22969004": "I'll treasure it forever!",
  "str_quest_chat01_22969005": "Now what should I give her in return...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23062001": "Has our honored guest had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23062002": "I was just about to ask the very same thing, Anzu!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23062003": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23062004": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23062005": "Feel free to stop by my Kaniya Ramen whenever you have the time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23063001": "Our noodles are always served piping-hot!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23063002": "Business today has been just as hot too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23063003": "Making sure our customers eat the freshest, tastiest ramen is a race against time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23063004": "I'm amazed you have the time or energy to message me! Don't work too hard, you two...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23064001": "Would you like a bowl of Golden Ramen—",
  "str_quest_chat01_23064002": "Or perhaps a serving of soup dumplings?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23064003": "Gimme the ramen!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23064004": "Soup dumplings, please!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23064005": "Right away, friend! As soon as our delivery service is up and running, we'll have it right out for you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23064006": "When will that be?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23064007": "It's still under development! Check back again in a few weeks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23064008": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23065001": "All this cooking is wearing me out...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23065002": "Balancing our expenses isn't easy either...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23065003": "Whoa, it's rare to hear you guys complain about being tired.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23065004": "That's because our hearts are always in it, no matter how exhausted our bodies get!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23065005": "We got customers incoming! Time to get busy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23066001": "Good afternoon, honored guest!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23066002": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23066003": "We haven't seen you in the shop for quite some time now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23066004": "Your next meal's on us, so feel free to stop by!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23066005": "The pot's always boiling for you, friend!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23066006": "Sure! I'll swing by when I have some time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220001": "Good morning, little Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220002": "Have you seen Zeta?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220003": "She says she's been practicing a killer new technique, so she challenged me to a race. Problem is, I can't seem to find her anywhere.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220004": "Hmm, where should I begin...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220005": "Well, she ended up getting lost on the Colossus while she was looking for you, so the Fireflies brought her to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220006": "And now, I'm stuck playing the role of the captured prince in a sleeping dragon's castle...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220007": "While our brave knights, Zeta and Carleen, face off against Vice, the terrible dragon keeping me prisoner.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220008": "My, you sure are popular today, PlayerName! I'm not sure how I feel about all this competition.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220009": "They're the ones having fun right now, not me. I've been stuck in here with nothing to do for a while now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220010": "Is that so? Well, I can't say this kind of role-play is exactly my thing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220011": "But what if I were to kidnap you while they weren't looking?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23220012": "I wouldn't mind doing that at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221001": "Wanna go for a ride?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221002": "A little morning air does wonders for a person's body and mind!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221003": "I wish I could, but I'm going to Umbraton today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221004": "Umbraton? You would turn me down for a dingy, rainy place like that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221005": "Well, the newspaper says that the local guilds are putting together an exhibition of Astra's most famous delicacies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221006": "Supposedly, they're even bringing in some specialty wines from Far East!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221007": "Far Eastern wine, huh? Sounds pretty interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221008": "Even though I'm not allowed to drink...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221009": "All the food and shopping should more than makeup for it. I might even check out the dam at night!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221010": "Oho? Sounds like the perfect date to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221011": "So tell me, who's the lucky lady going with you today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221012": "D-D-Date?! N-No, I was planning on going by myself!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221013": "Oh? Does that mean I still have a shot then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221014": "Just kidding, I completely understand. With all the friends you have, it's normal to want some alone time for yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221015": "But if you ever change your mind, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23221016": "You know where to find me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253001": "Time to get up! It's late!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253002": "Morning, Azure. What's with the message this early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253003": "Oh, is it still early?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253004": "Care to guess what time it is now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253005": "Wh-What time is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253006": "Time for you to be a chair.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253007": "Oh, I'm supposed to help you today, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253008": "I'm coming over right this moment!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253009": "Forget it, the work is almost done.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253010": "Sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253011": "It's okay.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253012": "I'm just a little surprised that you have the gall to brush me off.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253013": "I didn't mean it, honest!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253014": "I'll do anything to make it up to you, as long as you forgive me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253015": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253016": "According to office rules, I get to sit on you if you're late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253017": "I'll forgive you if you can last a minute next time I see you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253018": "I-I'll try...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253019": "It's quite all right, you can try as many times as you like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253020": "We have all the time in the world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23253021": "Somebody save me...!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254001": "Wanna go for a ride?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254002": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254003": "Really? Even before finding out where I'm taking you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254004": "Uh, where?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254005": "I'm a little occupied right now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254006": "That's too bad, I was gonna show you something nice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254007": "Something nice?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254008": "Wow, you fell for it just like that... Not a hard one to reel in at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254009": "Heh, just teasing. Don't take it seriously.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254010": "Don't you have any work to do, Azure?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254011": "Why are you teasing me again?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254012": "Heheh. Surely you can stand a bit of teasing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254013": "Fine, fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254014": "I knew talking to you when I was feeling bored would recharge my batteries.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254015": "I've gotta get back to work now. Bye, little Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254016": "Bye...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23254017": "What was that all about...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255001": "The work at the agency is surprisingly entertaining.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255002": "It's not every day you get to see a foe bullet-dancing, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255003": "Bullet dancing...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255004": "Yeah, firing shots rapidly at the ground near the enemy's feet...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255005": "You can't hurt them, yet still make them dance around to not get shot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255006": "That's awful... poor enemy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255007": "Would you still feel that way if it was a bad man?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255008": "Bad man? What bad man?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255009": "It's a bounty.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255010": "The client said I could do whatever I wanted to make the bad man pay.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255011": "I see. That's great, then...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255012": "Were you worried about me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255013": "A little worried... but only a little.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255014": "Only a little?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255015": "Then you must dance too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255016": "No, I don't!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255017": "Sorry, I shouldn't try to tease you! I worry about you a lot!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255018": "All right, time for this bad man to stop.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255019": "You made him dance this whole time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255020": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23255021": "I do everything my own way, even work. Life is dull otherwise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256001": "Morning, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256002": "You were incredible last night, I've never seen you work so hard before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256003": "But you still have a lot to learn, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256004": "Uh... Th-Thanks? Last night's sniper rifle training was pretty fun for me too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256005": "Hmph, no fun as usual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256006": "Sigh, I guess this is the real you, after all...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256007": "You're like a completely different person when you have the Eye of the Lynx in your hands!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256008": "What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256009": "Well... You become so focused and serious. It's kind of cool, actually!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256010": "Is that why your shooting has been improving so slowly lately? Because you've been ogling me the whole time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256011": "N-Not at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256012": "Oh, really? Heheheh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256013": "I dunno, maybe?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256014": "...!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256015": "Heh... Well, at least you're making progress outside of your shooting skills.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256016": "See? Isn't this fun?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23256017": "I'm looking forward to seeing even more progress from you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257001": "Are you okay, little Caelestite?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257002": "It seems the morning exercise was too intense for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257003": "Yeah, my head's still spinning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257004": "We drove around the Colossus for full ten laps early in the morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257005": "You're the one who said you wanted to learn how to drift, weren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257006": "So how much of our lesson do you still remember?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257007": "If you forget too much of it, I'll have no choice but to punish you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257008": "What's the punishment?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257009": "My, you're awfully eager today, aren't you? That suits me just fine!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257010": "N-No, wait...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257011": "I still remember!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257012": "\"Rule #1: Cherish your car the same way you cherish your friends.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257013": "\"If you do, your car will treat you just as well.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257014": "\"Rule #2: The only other rule...\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257015": ".\".. is to step on the gas, and let your instincts take the wheel.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257016": "Not bad, you still remember everything!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257017": "Now let's strike while the iron is still hot! How about another ten laps?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23257018": "I think you're the one who's too eager today, Miss Azure...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23258001": "I'm watching the sunrise right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23258002": "The clouds are beautiful this morning. If only I could wake up to a sight like this every day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23258003": "Yeah, I'm looking at the sunrise from the Bridge too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23258004": "The golden sun bleeding through the clouds...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23258005": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23258006": "D-Did I say something wrong? I'm not really used to describing stuff like this...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23258007": "Not really, it's just that talking to you like this... It feels like we woke up to watch the sunrise together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23258008": "It's a nice feeling.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259001": "Are you awake yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259002": "No...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259003": "You sound a little drained? Did you have a strange dream last night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259004": "... I just dreamed about the past again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259005": "I understand. It's okay if you don't want to chat right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259006": "But if you do need someone to talk to, I'm always here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259007": "I'm fine, really. Sorry for making you worry this early in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259008": "No need to apologize. You know you can always come to me whenever you want some extra attention, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259009": "Thanks, Azure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259010": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259011": "We've both lost more than anyone should ever lose, but nothing is more stupid than letting the past weigh you down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259012": "It would be a waste of such a beautiful day too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259013": "Yeah, you're absolutely right!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259014": "I need to seize the day, not spend it moping around in bed! And I'll start with cleaning up my room...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259015": "Good. We all need motivation to get through the day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259016": "And if you're still feeling down, you can always try dreaming of me tonight!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259017": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23259018": "I bet it'll be the sweetest of dreams too. Heheh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265001": "What should we have for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265002": "Well, I haven't decided, either and still mulling it over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265003": "What do you usually get?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265004": "Nothing specific.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265005": "I'd just drive on the job and eat wherever I may be.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265006": "From the usual fares to rare bites, I've tried them all as long as they're edible.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265007": "So, eating the same thing every day in the office like this...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265008": "It's unbearable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265009": "I can relate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265010": "I consumed nothing but condensed nutrients for seventeen years.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265011": "I didn't feel anything was wrong with that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265012": "Until I got out and now think they're bland as bland can be.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265013": "Right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265014": "It's all right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265015": "If you ask me about food such as fried sandworms...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265016": "I'd say I really don't have the gumption to try it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265017": "To me, just three normal meals a day will do!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265018": "Tsk, I didn't expect you to be so old-fashioned and boring.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265019": "Well, might as well go out and hunt.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265020": "Eat whatever is killed. Barbecue is never bad with good booze around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265021": "What about the office? What if a client comes in?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265022": "I'm closing up for the day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23265023": "You're way too free-wheeling...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266001": "What a hot afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266002": "I'd love to go joyriding and let the wind take all the sweat off me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266003": "I remember the fan in the office worked pretty well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266004": "Is it broken?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266005": "No. On the contrary, it's working overtime just to please me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266006": "But I just can't get used to the air in the completely sealed, stuffy room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266007": "Particularly when there's booze in the air, it's damp and sticky to breathe.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266008": "You're drinking on the clock again, Azure...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266009": "It's adults' prerogative.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266010": "I can do anything as long as I'm responsible for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266011": "Have you thought about what to do when you're an adult, little Caelestite?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266012": "I, uh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266013": "You haven't, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266014": "No rush, take it easy. You still got lots of time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266015": "Is there anything you want to do, Azure?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266016": "I mean, other than drinking and driving...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266017": "Something that has a special meaning to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266018": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266019": "I have only one goal: to protect my found family.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266020": "You must have similar feelings, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266021": "Yeah, I have something I want to protect.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266022": "And that'll be enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23266023": "I hope you'll be strong enough to fulfill your dreams. Don't let me down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267001": "I'm bored. Anything interesting going on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267002": "Fun stories? Let me think...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267003": "Hey, wait a minute, aren't you working right now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267004": "Not only do you not answer the question, you back-talked me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267005": "Think you're all grown up now, little Caelestite?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267006": "I-I was just asking...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267007": "I didn't mean anything else!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267008": "So, you think you can just ask me anything out of the blue?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267009": "No!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267010": "Hey, relax.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267011": "It feels nice to get nibbles from baby preys.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267012": "Baby prey...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267013": "What else can you be?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267014": "So you wanna go from being the prey to the predator?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267015": "No!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267016": "I never got that idea!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267017": "That's not what I meant!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267018": "I-I just don't wanna be, uh, like...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267019": "Heheheh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267020": "Look at you, can't even be coherent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267021": "See, my neck's been out all this time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267022": "Just waiting for the day you've finally grown fangs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267023": "Curses, playing me like a fiddle...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23267024": "Never taking me seriously at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283001": "Why don't we have a drink?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283002": "Are you drinking again, Azure?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283003": "Grown-ups like to wipe sorrows away with booze.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283004": "But don't you dare pick that up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283005": "Huh? How come you would say that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283006": "That's not like your usual self.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283007": "So what's my usual self to you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283008": "Well, very cool and informal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283009": "Anything bothering you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283010": "It's rare to see you sound so down...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283011": "So that's how you see me, I see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283012": "All right, we'll talk about something different for once.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283013": "Roy nagged at me again today and it made me think back.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283014": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283015": "Nothing specific.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283016": "I just thought while Roy changed a lot, who he really is stayed the same.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283017": "Me too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283018": "Be it cool, crazy, or concerned, it's all to protect the most important thing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283019": "I'm not seeking to become something else but doing my best to survive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283020": "Azure...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283021": "Didn't expect that, did you? People in Rediesel Wrench might seem free, but they're bound together in mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23283022": "Perhaps they have even less freedom than people elsewhere.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284001": "Are you still awake, little Caelestite?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284002": "No, I'm not in bed yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284003": "You're a naughty kid for staying up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284004": "That's because you sent me a message.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284005": "So you got up just to reply?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284006": "Wouldn't that make me the bad guy in this scenario?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284007": "How come you're not in bed either? Did you go joyriding again?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284008": "I'd very much like to give you a resounding \"Yes.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284009": "Unfortunately, I'm working.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284010": "Still working this late at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284011": "Yeah. I haven't seen the quarry yet, so it's very annoying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284012": "To kill time, I can only resort to drinking and talking to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284013": "Drinking before a fight? Are you sure about that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284014": "A small drink makes everything better.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284015": "You'll know when you grow up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284016": "There's the prey. Gotta go.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284017": "Get to sleep, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23284018": "Okay, I know... Take care of yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285001": "Evening. What's on your mind?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285002": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285003": "Nothing on my mind, just can't fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285004": "So you have no secret to share with me at all?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285005": "Well, if I tell you, promise me you won't make fun of me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285006": "Sure, I promise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285007": "O-Okay, here it goes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285008": "Sometimes, I feel...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285009": "... embarrassed about not being able to wade in and fight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285010": "But you have powers that Aurorians don't.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285011": "There are different roles in a battle. You can't always be at the forefront and look cool.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285012": "I know...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285013": "But always having others step up and save the day...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285014": "I just feel I can do more!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285015": "Yeah, I know it's a bunch of nonsense too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285016": "So just pretend I never said anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285017": "Don't say that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285018": "They said that it's easy for people who sit back and command to lose their senses.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285019": "Senses?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285020": "Yeah, because they tend to forget those who actually fight are not expendable but living flesh and blood.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285021": "But that's not how you feel, so that's a rare quality to have.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285022": "Oh my. I think I might be falling for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285023": "Y-You think so?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285024": "Yeah, so don't get hung up on it anymore, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23285025": "Always bare that in your mind and grow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383001": "It's okay, little guy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383002": "You just lost, that's all! Don't let it get you down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383003": "That's not particularly comforting, coming from the winner...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383004": "But at least I know exactly where I messed up now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383005": "I should've used my super-mobile Spikepests to draw out your fire and protect my brood mother!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383006": "Man... And here I thought I was starting to get good at Crash & Burn too...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383007": "Hahahaha! It's no fun if you always win, buddy! A little challenge now and then is good for you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383008": "Besides, you were playing against the guy who designed the game in the first place!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383009": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383010": "Yeah! Odi says it's one of the few worthwhile things I've ever invented. Can you believe that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383011": "By letting me play as the Eclipsites, this game lets me see things from the enemy's perspective.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383012": "It's honestly really refreshing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383013": "The strengths, weaknesses, and movement abilities of the Eclipsites in this game are incredibly realistic.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383014": "How did you come up with such a detailed board game?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383015": "Oh, that? Well, when you've seen as much as I have in your life as a little kid...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383016": "... and fight with Eclipsites all the time. You tend to remember a lot of details, whether you want to or not.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383017": "What's worse is that unlike this game, your allies don't come back to life, even though the enemy does.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383018": "Wait, did I just stumble upon some sort of terrible secret...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383019": "Nah, not really. You should call it a night, though; playing games too much will rot your brain!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23383020": "Get some rest, PlayerName. You've got plenty of real battles ahead of you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384001": "So what do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384002": "That ball-shaped Eclipsite plushie I gave you is pretty nice, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384003": "No kidding! It's so soft that whenever I lean on it to read, I start to feel really sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384004": "Oh yeah? Makes sense, since it's one of my masterpieces!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384005": "So what made you decide to craft plushies as a hobby, Roy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384006": "You know, you're the first person to ask me that question...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384007": "It's a long story, and not a very interesting one, to be honest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384008": "Besides, shouldn't you be getting ready for bed? It's getting pretty late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384009": "Well, I am feeling a little sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384010": "Hahaha! Good choice, kid!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384011": "But I want to know!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384012": "Jeez... Are all Caelestites this curious, or is it just you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384013": "Let me see... It all started around the time I met the Rediesel Wrench.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384014": "Back then, Azure said I was too dangerous to keep around, even if I was half-dead.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384015": "She was right, you know? But the previous leader of the Wrench... He was pretty convinced that I could be of use to her.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384016": "He said that anything found in the desert can and should be used to its fullest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384017": "Heh... I figured being stingy was just one of the Rediesel Wrench's rules.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384018": "After all, what could a busted-up blade do for them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384019": "That's when I got my first job: to fix a stuffed animal while my injuries healed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384020": "So that was the first plushie you ever worked on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384021": "That's right! And when I gave it back to its owner... That was the first time I saw her smile.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384022": "Even though I still had a long way to go before earning everyone's trust...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384023": "From the bottom of my heart, I felt so proud that these hands of mine could do something like that. Something that didn't involve fighting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384024": "Oh, whoops! Sorry for dragging out the story like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384025": "Anyways, it wasn't long before I started making plushies for everyone in my spare time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384026": "It's nice to keep a few hobbies, you know? Makes me feel like life's not all that crazy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384027": "Ah, but you're probably tired of listening to me ramble, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23384028": "Have a good night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385001": "I think I saw you leaving the Cafe just now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385002": "I didn't wake you up, did I?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385003": "No, not at all! I didn't eat much for dinner last night, so I got up for a little midnight snack...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385004": "Just please don't tell Vice!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385005": "Today was such a boring day too. It felt like such a shame to go to bed so early.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385006": "I see... A shame, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385007": "You have a place where you can safely close your eyes and rest, a place where you don't have to sleep with a weapon in your hands...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385008": "A place where nightmares don't scare you awake every single night, and you can even look forward to the coming day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385009": "Not many folks have the privilege of spending their days so peacefully, kid. Guess you still have a lot to learn, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385010": "Er... I...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385011": "Ahahaha, there I go rambling again! Sorry about that, I didn't mean to put you down or anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385012": "Today's younger generations should be making history, not looking back on it all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385013": "I say that, but I know just how tiring it is to do something special every single day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385014": "Just start by doing simple, little things every day and you'll be fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385015": "Like what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23385016": "Like going to bed at a reasonable time. Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386001": "Thanks for your help today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386002": "If it wasn't for you and Brock, I would've spent all day organizing the warehouse.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386003": "Whew... It was a real workout, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386004": "But that meal you served us afterward was amazing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386005": "I still don't know what you used to cook it... But that's probably for the better.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386006": "Brock says organizing the warehouse is his latest and greatest exercise program. Apparently, it can even make you stronger in battle...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386007": "It sounded like a bunk to me, but that didn't stop him from dragging me along... I'm so sore...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386008": "Is that what happened? No wonder he was being more energetic than usual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386009": "Honestly, I told him that there wasn't any special training involved or anything...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386010": "I just said that logistics work involves a lot of heavy lifting, and that I was a little short-handed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386011": "Anyways, if you're trying to bulk up like him to become more popular, you should keep something in mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386012": "Once your muscles get to a certain size, the only people you're gonna attract are other fitness-obsessed nutjobs who want to learn your training secrets.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386013": "And besides, aren't you popular enough already?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386014": "Y-You think so?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386015": "That's right! But don't get me wrong, I like the extra help every now and then. It gives me a chance to slack off a little too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386016": "But no slacking off for me tonight. I still have plenty of work to do, so why don't you get some rest?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386017": "Remember to take a warm shower and stretch before bed. It'll help with muscle soreness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23386018": "Sure... I'll go do that right now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387001": "Hey, I know you're usually asleep around this time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387002": "But I thought I should let you know...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387003": "The Fireflies and I fixed that thing in the Rec Room that Sinsa destroyed earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387004": "I had a chance to take a look at its components too. Caelestite technology is something else, you know...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387005": "Yeah, I remember when that happened. The noise scared the living daylights out of me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387006": "Hahaha! Boy, I remember when Sinsa first picked up that wrench...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387007": "\"From now on, it's my turn to protect you, and all of the Rediesel Wrench!\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387008": "I was rocked to my core when he said that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387009": "Now it's been over a decade, and the guy still wants to prove his strength whenever he gets the chance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387010": "Guess he's still a kid after all, huh? Still, can't say I don't like that about him.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387011": "Anyways, PlayerName, does this strength-measuring device have a scoreboard of some kind?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387012": "Now that you mention it, I saw Barton unleash a massive attack on it a few days ago...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387013": "Could it be that everyone's secretly competing for the highest score?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387014": "I wouldn't doubt it, considering how many powerful Aurorians you have running around here. You're pretty strong for bringing them all together too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387015": "Should I put a sign there?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387016": "Yeah, a sign might remind everyone to be more careful with the Rec Room's equipment. I'll help you put one up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387017": "You're not gonna take me apart too, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387018": "Huh? Is that all right with you? Heck, I can even modify your arms with some mantis blades if you'd like?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387019": "Not a chance!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387020": "Hahahaha! Just kidding, just kidding.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387021": "Anyways PlayerName, as long as you're a friend of the Rediesel Wrench...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387022": "I promise I'll do everything in my power to keep your Colossus all in one piece! Oh, and you too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23387023": "Just leave it to me, and try to get some shut-eye. It's pretty late, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463001": "The mission you assigned a few days ago has been completed, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463002": "Huh? When did I assign a mission?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463003": "You said, \"Read a book when there's nothing to do.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463004": "Uh, that's only a suggestion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463005": "Lenore did read a book.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463006": "Which one?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463007": "The Psychological Models of Primal Aurorians on Astra.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463008": "That's impressive. Just hearing the title gave me a headache.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463009": "So what did the book say?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463010": "Don't know. Lenore doesn't get it, but Lenore finished it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23463011": "Well, that's pretty amazing too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464001": "Thump, thump!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464002": "What the...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464003": "I'm mimicking a piano tune Lenore heard during lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464004": "It sounds like very radical music.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464005": "It's weird, but it got the blood pumping when Lenore heard it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464006": "Lenore can't remember anything now other than the melody.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464007": "Will Lenore turn back into a puppet again?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464008": "No way. Be more self-assured, you're an Aurorian!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464009": "You're getting that feeling because the music resonated with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464010": "That actually indicates you're becoming more sentient.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464011": "But Lenore is afraid to listen anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464012": "Don't worry. Music is marvelous. You should listen to it more.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464013": "As you command. Lenore shall listen to it a hundred times.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23464014": "What did I just do...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465001": "Good afternoon. Please assign a mission to Lenore, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465002": "No mission right now. Feel free to hang out on your own.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465003": "Lenore heard there's a game called Dare.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465004": "You mean Truth or Dare?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465005": "Yes. Loser must do what the winner says. Do you agree with that? ",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465006": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465007": "Do not ask any questions from this moment on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465008": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465009": "You lost.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465010": "Fine. What would you like me to do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465011": "Assign a mission to Lenore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465013": "You won.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465014": "That easily?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465015": "Yes. Now you can assign Lenore to do anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23465016": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466001": "Mumble, mumble...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466002": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466003": "There are birds outside the window. Lenore is asking them if they want food.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466004": "But they ignore Lenore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466005": "They don't understand what you're saying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466006": "It's lunch time now. Birds have to eat too, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466007": "Yeah. Speaking of that, I'm hungry myself. Have you eaten?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466008": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466009": "Then let's get lunch and feed grains to the birds afterward.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466010": "Lenore likes this mission from you very much, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466011": "Okay. Why don't you tell the birds to wait for us.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23466012": "Mumble, mumble.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23467001": "Have you had lunch, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23467002": "Not yet. I'm a little tired today and too lazy to scrounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23467003": "As you command.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23467004": "What? What command?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23467005": "Feed PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23467006": "I gave no such command!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23467007": "But you haven't eaten and didn't wish to feed yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23467008": "Lenore can go to the kitchen now, makes lunch and feeds it to PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23467009": "It's okay, I'll grab food on my own!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468001": "Why do people cry?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468003": "I saw a girl weeping by the road yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468004": "Maybe something sad happened to her.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468005": "What is \"something sad?\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468006": "Like losing a family or friend, or getting hurt...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468007": "But the source isn't necessarily all bad.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468008": "It doesn't have to be sadness. You could cry from joy or be moved.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468009": "When I find myself unable to laugh, can I convey joy through tears?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468010": "That will have to be a tremendous joy... Usually, just stick to smiling.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468011": "What if you just can't laugh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468012": "It's okay.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23468013": "Even if you don't, others can still feel it from the looks in your eyes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23562001": "The high-noon sun is torture for those who enjoy a good sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23562002": "Maybe it's a reminder that you should get up out of bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23562003": "Why get up? What will that accomplish?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23562004": "Get lunch, maybe?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23562005": "Yawn... I have no need for such a mundane option.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23562006": "We're having a lot of meat for lunch today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23562007": "I'll be right over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563001": "I just had a very bloody dream...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563003": "I dreamed I turned into a big bad wolf.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563004": "I ran into the woods and devoured Little Red Riding Hood and her grandma.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563005": "Does that mean I'm a demon in nature, destined to be forsaken by mortals?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563006": "Or maybe you're just famished.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563007": "That's it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563008": "That's it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563009": "Does that I should get up and have lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563010": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563011": "I'm so sleepy. Let me snooze.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23563012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23564001": "You got any snacks?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23564002": "You weren't full from lunch? I'll get the Fireflies to send you something.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23564003": "No, I didn't have lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23564004": "Why not?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23564005": "I got up too late and there was no meat left when I showed up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23564006": "You really should eat things other than meat.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23564007": "So when are the Fireflies coming with snacks?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23564008": "You can't substitute meals with snacks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23564009": "Yawn... I'm going back to sleep if they aren't here soon...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565001": "I couldn't sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565002": "Well, that's usually the case, given it's noon and all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565003": "I can't sleep without figuring something out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565004": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565005": "I met a bard yesterday and he recited a poetry...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565006": "I am a bard. I like to write poetry. I don't care what others say, I just run my own life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565007": "You call that poetry?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565008": "Yeah, I think it's lame, too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565009": "But why would he recite such a banal piece of work?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565010": "Maybe he wasn't talented enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565011": "Could it be that there's something deeply profound hidden in the message?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23565012": "Or it could be you're reading too much into it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566001": "The sun is blinding and it reminds me of that question again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566002": "Why is a raven like a writing desk?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566003": "How do you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566004": "Because that's your catchphrase.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566005": "Do you know the answer?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566006": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566007": "You are indeed stupid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566008": "What? Do you know the answer?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566009": "Of course not. Why would I ask if I did?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566010": "Then you're stupid too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566011": "I'm not only stupid, but also a lazy bum.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23566012": "You don't say...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567001": "Do you know what day it is today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567002": "No. What's special about today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567003": "It's my birthday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567004": "Happy birthday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567005": "Actually, it's not my birthday today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567006": "I don't think it's your birthday today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567007": "Aw, busted.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567008": "Then why did you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567009": "Probably because I wanted congratulations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567010": "Even so, you don't have to lie about your birthday for that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23567011": "I mean, it really doesn't matter which day is my birthday, does it?",

  "str_quest_chat01_23685003": "Deliberately not asking who made the throw pillow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23685004": "What throw pillow?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23685005": "The one in the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23685006": "There's a throw pillow in the lounge?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23685007": "I sewed it and sneaked it in this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23685008": "It's been there the whole day. No way you could miss it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23685009": "I'm sorry, but I wasn't paying much attention. Thank you for the throw pillow you made.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23685010": "Was it pretty?",

  "str_quest_chat01_23686002": "Sure. What kind of game?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23686003": "I'll be the mother and you'll be the baby.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23686004": "Uh, maybe we can swap roles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23686005": "You want to be the mother?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23686006": "No, between us two, I should assume the older role.",

  "str_quest_chat01_23687005": "I want to sew your name on your clothes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23687006": "That way, you won't grab others' by mistake.",

  "str_quest_chat01_23688013": "Okay, I'll get Fireflies to send them to you. Just remember to brush your teeth after.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23688014": "Since it's on the way, I'll finish them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23688015": "They're not sent yet. You can still cancel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23688016": "Hurry up and send them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23754001": "Morning. Have you exercised today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23754002": "I've drafted a rigorous training program for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23754003": "I was just thinking about working out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23754004": "Not bad, you got a lot of drive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23754005": "Is it necessary...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23754006": "It's to improve your combat prowess and conditioning.",

  "str_quest_chat01_23754008": "I don't think so.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23754009": "That means you're gonna run me into the ground...",

  "str_quest_chat01_23755002": "Uh, just woke up, still in bed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23755003": "It doesn't make sense to sleep till this late.",

  "str_quest_chat01_23755005": "Well, I couldn't get past that one level for the life of me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23755006": "So you were playing a game?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23755007": "Sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23755008": "It's necessary to complement work with play, so get yourself a good rest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756001": "We have a big pot of fried rice to feast on for today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756002": "Did you make it yourself, Grand Marshal?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756003": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756004": "I didn't know you can cook.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756005": "Perfect, I'm in the mood for breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756006": "I'll get the Fireflies to deliver it. I cooked it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756007": "Really? You cook, Grand Marshal?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756008": "That's the only dish I know how to make, though it's pretty tasty.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756009": "I'll have the Fireflies bring over the whole pot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756010": "That's okay, just one bowl will do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756011": "You're fine. Vice and others won't eat it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23756012": "Hmm, I have a bad feeling about this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23757001": "You're late getting up again today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23757002": "Well, I think I'm a little under the weather.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23757003": "Look alive, or are you going to run from a fight?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23757004": "What, we're fighting now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23757005": "A war can break out anytime. It won't wait for you to feel better.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23757006": "Got it. I'll get up right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758001": "Morning. We're testing physical conditioning today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758002": "Conditioning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758003": "The space on Colossus is limited, so we'll just do the basics today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758004": "Pull-ups, parallel bar raise, push-ups and sit-ups.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758005": "That sounds like a chore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758006": "Come join.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758007": "What, me too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758008": "You're rather weak, but I won't let you off the hook.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758009": "Uh, umm...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758010": "I believe you're tough enough to handle it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23758011": "On my way!",
  "str_quest_chat01_23759001": "Morning. We're serving a nice breakfast today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23759002": "Really? I'm a bit hungry, but too lazy to get up...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23759003": "It will only get worse if you stay under cover.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23759004": "Laziness wears out the body worse than labor.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23759005": "Plus, the food's gonna run out if you don't hurry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23759006": "I guess I'll sleep till lunch, then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23759007": "I guess I'll go yank you out of the bed myself, then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_23759008": "Never mind, I'll get up now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_23759009": "Okay, I'll get up right away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064001": "Hey, what are you up to? Respond to my message now! ",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064002": "I'm reading a horror novel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064003": "You got taste. I like horror novels too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064004": "They don't scare you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064005": "How is that possible? Do you take me for a coward?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064006": "Oh yeah? Do you dare to watch a scary movie with me? ",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064007": "Of course I dare. I never back down from anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064008": "Okay, this afternoon, in the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064009": "I got afternoon tea today, can't make it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064010": "Make it evening.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064011": "No time, got fashions to design.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064012": "You're obviously afraid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064013": "There's nothing I'm afraid to do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064014": "Then how about later...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24064015": "Gotta run, stuff to do, places to be. Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065001": "Cutter, polisher, embedder.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065002": "What are you babbling about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065003": "Got those machines on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065004": "Nope. What do you want them for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065005": "Refining gemstones.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065006": "I just designed a multi-gem necklace.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065007": "And I can't wait to make it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065008": "That sounds amazing. I wouldn't mind seeing the final product.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065009": "Well, since you look forward to it so much...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065010": "I'll show it to you first when it's done.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065011": "But try not to let my work knock your socks off too much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24065012": "I'll be waiting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066001": "Didn't see you the whole morning. What were you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066002": "I just woke up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066003": "Slept till noon? What a slacker.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066004": "I kept tossing and turning last night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066005": "Do you sun-dry the blanket?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066006": "Sun-dry the blanket?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066007": "Yeah, my secret for a good night's sleep is...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066008": "Clutching a blanket that had been sun-dried! ",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066009": "Does that work?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066010": "Of course it does! Sun-dried blankets are warm and comfy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066011": "Every time I hold it, it feels like I got a sun in my arms.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24066012": "Okay, thanks for the advice. I'll try it out tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067001": "The Colossus is too small. I can't find a suitable place for an afternoon tea party.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067002": "Uh, how many people do you plan to invite?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067003": "No one at all. The party is exclusively for me and me only.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067004": "But perhaps I will consider inviting you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067005": "Thanks, but I'm not going.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067006": "How dare you decline! It's not everyday I send out an invitation!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067007": "I've never attended a tea party, nor do I know what to do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067008": "You don't have to do anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067009": "You just have to enjoy the exquisite desserts and scented tea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067010": "Got it, eat and be lazy. I can do that just fine!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24067011": "No, stupid! You made it sound boorish and crass!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068001": "I can't stand it anymore! Haven't you noticed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068002": "Huh? Noticed what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068003": "You didn't see anything unusual when we were having lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068004": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068005": "I was in my newly designed outfit!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068006": "You were? I thought it was the same one you wore before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068007": "They're totally different! The lace, the folds... not the same!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068008": "They're both black so looked similar to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068009": "If it was in another color like red or pink, I'd notice for sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068010": "I would never design something that mundane and juvenile.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068011": "What? But red and pink are pretty colors.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24068012": "Classless fool!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069001": "Yeah, I just finished my meal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069002": "I just got done with lunch too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069003": "What did you have? Don't tell me it's peasant food?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069004": "Peasant food? What do you mean by that? ",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069005": "You know, greasy, awful stuff like burgers, fried chicken and that ilk. ",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069006": "I think they're delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069007": "I actually had caviar and lobster.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069008": "Not bad, we share a similar taste.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069009": "Though I wouldn't turn down burgers or fried chicken, either.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069010": "Unbelievable how some people would eat such unhealthy food.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069011": "It's not as bad as you think. Wanna try it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069012": "I'll never touch weird food like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069013": "It is kind of fun to try new food sometime, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069014": "And it might broaden your taste and horizons.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069015": "I go by my own rules and principles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24069016": "I'll not be tempted by peasant food.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24153001": "Morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24153002": "Morning, Sanae.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24153003": "Um, have you had breakfast? Should I prepare it for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24153004": "I did. I'm just reading right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24153005": "I see... Sorry to bother you. Please let me know if you need anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24153006": "Come on, we're friends, you don't have to wait on me hand and foot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24153007": "You're so kind, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154001": "*Sob*",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154002": "Why are you crying?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154003": "Please don't get rid of me, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154004": "What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154005": "I accidentally broke a little statue when I was cleaning the lounge...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154006": "What statue?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154007": "A cub statue. I broke off the head...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154008": "Oh, there are two pieces to begin with.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154009": "Really...? I thought I broke it because I was too strong.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154010": "Don't worry, you did nothing wrong.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24154011": "Phew, so good to hear that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24155001": "Morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24155002": "The breakfast was great! I loved it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24155003": "What did you have?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24155004": "A big plate of sashimi and 3 big bowls of rice. I'm stuffed!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24155005": "I see where you get your amazing strength from.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24155006": "Are you saying I eat too much?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24155007": "No. I'm happy to see you enjoy your life on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24155008": "I'm happy too, to have met you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24156001": "Hey, you think Sanae is boring, stupid and uninteresting, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24156002": "Manae, right? No, the thought never crossed my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24156003": "So how come you didn't respond when she said hello to you in the hallway?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24156004": "She did? I must have missed it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24156005": "Let me tell you, Sanae is a very cute and interesting girl!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24156006": "I know. That's how I feel too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24156007": "Then you should be kind and warm to her!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24156008": "I won't let you off the hook if you ever hurt her!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24156009": "Relax, I would never.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157001": "Hey, rise and shine!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157002": "Manae? Yeah, I got up already.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157003": "Then why aren't you talking to Sanae?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157004": "She swept the floor outside your room spotless early in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157005": "Is that so? Well, thank her for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157006": "She's too hard-working, always doing things for other people.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157007": "A shame they usually don't notice, so I must remind you all on her behalf!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157008": "It's true she also ruined things with her clumsiness, but don't pay attention to that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157009": "What should we pay attention to, then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157010": "Pump her up and encourage her to do it right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157011": "Okay, I bet Sanae ruined something accidentally again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157012": "It was your breakfast... Anyway, figure out how to get it yourself!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24157013": "Got it, she swept the floor because she spilled my breakfast again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24382001": "Are you in bed, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24382002": "Not yet. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24382003": "I'm out of coffee. You got any extra?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24382004": "Yeah. I'll have the Fireflies deliver it to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24382005": "Thanks much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24382006": "It's hard to fall asleep having coffee this late at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24382007": "I plan to burn the midnight oil. Working on the tunnel blueprint tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24382008": "You sure work hard. Turn in as soon as you're done.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383001": "Good evening, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383002": "Evening, Ciel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383003": "I read a very interesting book lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383004": "What's it about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383005": "A scientist who's enamored with balloons.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383006": "He aspired to traverse Astra in a hot air balloon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383007": "He was met with many setbacks and challenges.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383008": "But he never gave up and fulfilled the dream at last.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383009": "Wow, that sounds very exciting!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383010": "Yeah. I plan to design a hot balloon myself and stack it against the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24383011": "Cool. Looking forward to it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24384001": "Do you have trouble sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24384002": "Chronic insomnia.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24384003": "Occasional insomnia.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24384004": "I've found that a hammock can make you fall asleep very quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24384005": "Hammock?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24384006": "It's a bed constructed out of ropes and suspended between two stationary points.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24384007": "The rocking motion puts you to sleep very fast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24384008": "Or maybe passing out from dizziness?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24384009": "Possibly, but it still counts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385001": "You're still up, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385002": "I was playing games and lost track of time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385003": "How come you're still up, too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385004": "I'm researching a new material that can improve a mech's resistance by tenfold! ",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385005": "Really? That's very impressive!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385006": "I plan to use it to modify my mech, making it more durable and mobile.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385007": "I already got concepts percolating.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385008": "Such as integrating the material to the joints.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385009": "That will increase the range and speed of the mech.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385010": "We're both staying up, but I'm playing games, whereas you're doing research...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385011": "But didn't you enjoy it too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24385012": "True.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386001": "Do you like watching the night sky, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386003": "I rarely do that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386004": "The sky is spectacular tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386005": "An idea crossed my mind when I was gazing at the stars, though...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386006": "Put a mini-cam and sensors on a balloon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386007": "Then send it up high to capture stunning images.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386008": "That sounds awesome!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386009": "The flight of a balloon, however, is influenced by many factors.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386010": "Like wind direction, temperature, pressure, and so on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386011": "I'll have to keep adjusting and improving the design for it to fly higher and farther.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386012": "I'm stoked all of a sudden... Gotta go whip out a draft!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24386013": "I guess it's another sleepless night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24464001": "So excited! I'm gobbling it all down!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24464002": "What got you so hyped?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24464003": "Master promised to take me to find wondrous creatures after lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24464004": "Really? Where are you going?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24464005": "Don't know. Master is being cryptic.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24464006": "But I know we'll find them for sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24464007": "Maybe this afternoon will change the world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24464008": "But we're having a huge lunch today, and it's all vegetarian.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24464009": "Man, I hate eating it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24464010": "Ah, I think I know why Vic made that promise...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465001": "Why is it only noon?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465002": "When will it be evening?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465003": "What's going on in the evening?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465004": "Master promised to take us to Rediesel Desert tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465005": "Why the desert?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465006": "He said there's a wondrous animal there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465007": "It resembled a fox, but with wings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465008": "It's also naughty and likes to steal snacks from Aurorians.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465009": "So I specifically got a lot of snacks to draw it out of hiding.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465010": "But if it doesn't get dark soon, I'll run through the snacks myself...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24465011": "I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24466001": "It's been a long time. Still remember me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24466002": "Of course. I missed you and Kyllo.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24466003": "That's more like it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24466004": "Do you know Kyllo picked up a new trick.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24466005": "It learned to dance around with a ball on its head.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24466006": "Kyllo is very smart.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24466007": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24466008": "My Kyllo is the cutest, smartest creature in the world!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467001": "Hey, what are you up to?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467002": "Getting ready for an afternoon nap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467003": "Well, I bought a cute little toy for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467004": "It's a small flying saucer with a lot of pretty lights.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467005": "It's shiny and unbelievably adorable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467006": "And it's no ordinary toy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467007": "It will fly and make interesting sounds.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467008": "I love flying saucers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467009": "Since you like it so much, it's yours.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467010": "Will it work for me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467011": "Of course. It's very light, even you can carry it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24467012": "All right. Thanks much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468001": "Drat it all to hell!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468002": "I'm so livid, I'm in no mood for lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468003": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468004": "I was walking Kyllo yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468005": "Somebody dared call it a fake!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468006": "And accused me of being a charlatan who used cheap tricks to draw attention.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468007": "How rude.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468008": "He had no idea what a wondrous beast is.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468009": "That made me so mad!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468010": "You should still eat, no matter how angry you are.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468011": "Yeah, you're right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468012": "I got to get my fill and get stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24468013": "So I can beat up bad people like him the next time I see them!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469001": "Hey, heard any news about wondrous creatures lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469002": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469003": "Sigh. I'd love to find one quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469004": "But don't you already have Kyllo?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469005": "Kyllo is a gift from the master. I want to find a new one on my own.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469006": "How come you're hung up on finding one?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469007": "Fool, don't you think it's unbelievable to discover a wondrous creature?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469008": "I think they're the greatest, most wonderful lifeforms in the world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469009": "I'd also like to prove to my master that I'm a competent trainer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469010": "That I can handle the tasks he assigned and he can be proud of me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469011": "But the most important goal is for me to be friends with the creatures.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469012": "And explore this marvelous world with them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469013": "I didn't expect you to have such an admirable goal! I got your back!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24469014": "Don't you underestimate me, fool.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563002": "I heard you're proficient in manipulating people.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563003": "Uh, no, that's not true.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563004": "But everyone fought under your command.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563005": "I'd very much like to find out who's the better manipulator between you and me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563006": "How do we do that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563007": "This is a part of my latest performance...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563008": "I suspend a person in air with a rope, then make him disappear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563009": "Can you guess how I did it? ",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563010": "No clue.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563011": "It's a misdirection.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563012": "Heh, I'll never tell.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24563013": "It's a magician's secret.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564002": "I bought a few replica scrolls from the Art Hall.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564003": "I'll take them to you in a moment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564004": "Thanks. You went to the Art Hall?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564005": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564006": "Browsing among the artwork alone is my favorite pastime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564007": "Don't you feel lonely or bored going by yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564008": "Absolutely not.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564009": "You get to spend more time examining and thinking when you're alone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564010": "It's easier to discover details and meanings others often overlooked.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564011": "I like looking at artwork too, but I don't usually understand them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564012": "Just take it easy, don't put too much pressure or expectation on yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564013": "You don't have to comprehend everything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24564014": "You only have to enjoy the pleasure and miracles that artwork brings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24565001": "If I were to feature some handicraft made by kids on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24565002": "Would you be fine with that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24565003": "Of course. But how did you get them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24565004": "I put on a magic show for a bunch of kids yesterday and got them excited.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24565005": "So they went to the length of giving me some handicrafts they made as gifts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24565006": "That's wonderful! You must be popular with them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24565007": "I taught them some simple tricks, too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24565008": "Like pulling a coin out of thin air and a flower from a napkin.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24565009": "They learned very quickly, the smart fellows they were.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24565010": "That's neat! You're a great teacher!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566001": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566002": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566003": "I was making lunch for myself but it seems I made too much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566004": "If you don't mind, I can't share it with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566005": "Sure. What did you make?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566006": "A salad with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566007": "I like vegetarian food.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566008": "Any meat to go with that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566009": "Some chicken breast and a bit of barbecue sauce.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566010": "Is that what you usually eat? ",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566011": "Yeah. I'm very careful about my weight and figure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566012": "As a magician, I have to retain dexterity and mobility.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24566013": "I don't want weight gain to affect my performance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24567001": "I heard you're looking for a pick-me-up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24567002": "Yeah, I felt sleepy from morning to noon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24567003": "Then you shall see a black coffee in a moment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24567004": "Will you be making it with magic?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24567005": "I'll be making it with a grinder and a coffee maker.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24568001": "Afternoon. It's time I get ready for my afternoon show.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24568002": "Did you invent any new trick?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24568003": "Yes, turning a poker card into Nightium. Wanna see it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24568004": "Definitely!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24568005": "It's even better if you give me all the Nightium!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24653001": "Morning. This is the perfect time to catch fish!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24653002": "There's no fish on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24653003": "Can you raise some?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24653004": "So you can catch them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24653005": "Yeah! Don't you think it's very fun to catch fish?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24653006": "It demands a stout heart and quick hands.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24653007": "Catching fish is too hard for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24653008": "I can teach you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24653009": "We can catch them the next time we're on a beach.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654001": "Morning. What's going on with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654002": "Reading a book on Caelestite history.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654003": "Oh, homesick?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654004": "A little. Where's your hometown, Rainbow?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654005": "A place far, far away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654006": "I left home to avoid the Darkover when I was very little.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654007": "Do you want to get back there?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654008": "Of course. I hope I can find it one day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654009": "How do you think you'll do that? Any plans?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654010": "The plan is... leave it up to chance!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24654011": "I'm sure I'll find it someday!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655001": "Morning, honorable PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655002": "Would you like to see the most exciting magic trick yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655003": "Let me hear you cheer!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655004": "Are you rehearsing your lines?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655005": "Yeah, I'm putting a show for the nobles in Lumopolis tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655006": "But I really don't want to go.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655007": "Why not? The nobles tend to be big spenders.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655008": "They're also too stuffy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655009": "I like to see the audience holler and roar in surprise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655010": "Is that something a big tip couldn't make up for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24655011": "Well, somewhat.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24656001": "It's so hot... I want to jump into the sea right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24656002": "Control yourself, we're high up in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24656003": "Hee! Let's have a water fight, then!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24656004": "I got a full schedule today, sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24656005": "Life is boring if you followed the schedule all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24656006": "So chuck that away!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24656007": "Okay, let's have a water fight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24656008": "Cool! Let's enjoy life to the fullest!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24656009": "Sorry, I want to finish work first.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24656010": "Fine. Come see me after you're done!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657001": "Ugh, help!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657002": "I made the corridor all wet!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657003": "Did you start a water fight in the hallways again?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657004": "No, I was refitting a robot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657005": "I was developing a robot that can move underwater.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657006": "So it can explore and collect stuff in water.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657007": "That sounds great.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657008": "Yeah, but I got the Colossus wet in duplicating the environment...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657009": "I'll send the Fireflies over to mop up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657010": "You're wonderful for not blaming me at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657011": "Well, no breakfast for you today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657012": "That's too bad...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24657013": "Because I already had it, hee!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24753001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24753002": "Morning there, Pollux.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24753003": "I went to Euphoria a little while back.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24753004": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24753005": "Mostly because it rained non-stop for days, and the old house isn't holding up well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24753006": "If I leave it as it is, those kids will have nowhere to stay...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24753007": "You should head back.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24753008": "Absolutely. You know, in a way, it's my \"Colossus.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_24753009": "You can move out though.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24753010": "I'm not really up for moving—that place is our home.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24754001": "You awake?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24754002": "This is still quite early...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24754003": "I'm trying to find the gem necklace—it's missing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24754004": "Maybe start by looking in your own room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24754005": "I noticed that a Firefly had dropped by. Maybe it put the necklace somewhere while bringing breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24754006": "Possible...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24754007": "I'm off to find that Firefly now! See you later!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755001": "Yo, good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755002": "You're pretty energized today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755003": "Cause I found a great spot nearby.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755004": "It's remote and empty, like no one goes there—not even animals.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755005": "Sounds like a perfect place for contemplation or meditation...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755006": "Actually, I'm thinking of practicing my shooting there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755007": "Why there, though?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755008": "'Cause there, I won't accidentally hurt any passing Aurorians or critters.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755009": "Didn't expect you to be this careful...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755010": "It's a nice place.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755011": "I know! Right? There is no risk of hurting others, and I can focus on training there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24755012": "Well then, best of luck with your practice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756001": "I have a plan.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756002": "It's too early...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756003": "I want to remodel my room a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756004": "Huh? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756005": "I get visitors pretty often, sometimes a bunch at once.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756006": "The Colossus is quite spacious. We can always find rooms for your visitors.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756007": "My idea is for them to stay the night together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756008": "So it's about the kids...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756009": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756010": "Well, you could get the Fireflies to set up a few makeshift beds and throw in some screens for separation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24756011": "Thank you so much!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24757001": "There's something I'd like to ask of you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24757002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24757003": "I'm hoping to use your Colossus to haul some goods.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24757004": "Today? I'm not sure...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24757005": "Relax, it's not happening today—it's a little way down the line.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24757006": "No problem.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24757007": "Many thanks! Once the new dormitories and classrooms are done, I'll definitely invite you to come visit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24757008": "Rebuilding Euphoria is a long and challenging journey indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24758001": "Gonna give these Fireflies a thumbs-up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24758002": "Morning there, what did they do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24758003": "They're like top laundry pros!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24758004": "So? What exactly did they do...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24758005": "I noticed them tidying up the room early this morning, and they even washed the handkerchief I used.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24758006": "It was quiet and fast, and the Fireflies were silent. Now the handkerchief is as good as new.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24758007": "Well, that's what they do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24758008": "With such impressive efficiency, they could really make a difference in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24758009": "If only Euphoria could have these little ones...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24855001": "Hi, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24855002": "Morning, Casta.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24855003": "There are folks around sipping on coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24855004": "Don't you like them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24855005": "No, I quite like it, especially its bitterness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24856001": "Have you seen Pollux?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24856002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24856003": "Where is that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24856004": "Huh? She was just here a moment ago. Did she already head out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24856005": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24856006": "Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_24856007": "What's the deal with you looking for her this early?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24856008": "Nothing much. I check up on her status every morning. It's become a routine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24856009": "You might wanna relax a little, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24857001": "A mobile home. This is pretty cool.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24857002": "What are you talking about so early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24857003": "It would be awesome if we could move Euphoria onto the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24857004": "How is that even possible? Euphoria is a town, after all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_24857005": "... I didn't phrase that right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24857006": "There are some bad apples in Euphoria too, so maybe having the orphanage flying could make it safer?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24857007": "You're really thinking about them all the time, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24857008": "Sigh, it's just a possible future that I think about occasionally.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24857009": "Making it happen... it's like reaching for the stars.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24858001": "Do you like rainy days?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24858002": "Did it rain just now? I didn't notice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24858003": "No, I was just asking out of curiosity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24858004": "I like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24858005": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24858006": "Why are you asking about this all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24858007": "Rainy days can be a pain when it comes to weapon maintenance. It takes more time and effort to deal with.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24858008": "It's a bit of a hassle. You agree?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24858009": "Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24859001": "Is there any way to improve shooting accuracy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24859002": "Practice more, maybe?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24859003": "Modify the firearms?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24859004": "Thinking about battle techniques this early, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_24859005": "This is the Colossus. We're pretty safe here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24859006": "Gotta get ready for the next battle, you know. Better safe than sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24859007": "Yeah, that's the spirit... But you don't have to be such an early bird about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24859008": "Getting enough rest matters too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_24859009": "Seems I can't expect advice from you. I'll just think on my own then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25084001": "Hey! Wanna go to Umbraton these days?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25084002": "For what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25084003": "I'm thinking of getting my hair dyed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25084004": "Huh? Why's that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25084005": "I feel a bit tired of my current hair color. What do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25084006": "It looks great.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25084007": "Why change it though?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25084008": "Well... I kinda feel the same.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25084009": "But if you go with a different color, you might lose your unique style, Lilica.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25084010": "You're right. I think I'll keep it as is.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085001": "I've been thinking about something recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085002": "Let's hear it. What's got you thinking so late at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085003": "I want to be the spokesperson of the Colossus. How does that sound?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085004": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085005": "Let me think...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085006": "Where did you get this idea?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085007": "There won't be any payment, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085008": "But this could be my attention-grabbing gimmick.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085009": "Gimmick? What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085010": "Eh, something like the \"One and Only Spokesperson of the Colossus in Astra\"?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25085011": "Ahem... I don't think that will work.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25086001": "Do you know of any late-night jobs available in Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25086002": "Why do you ask, all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25086003": "I'm, um, a bit tight on funds lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25086004": "It seems your path isn't an easy one either. Take care of yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25086005": "If you're looking for a job, maybe check out some of the guilds?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25086006": "Actually, I'd rather work on the Colossus than in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25086007": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25086008": "I feel like the work here might be a bit easier...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25086009": "But... the Colossus is tight on funds too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25086010": "Sigh, what a pity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25087001": "Seems like you don't have many clothes, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25087002": "What got you thinking about this?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25087003": "Actually, I'm just thinking about random stuff due to insomnia.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25087004": "Slept too much during the day?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25087005": "Drank too much coffee at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25087006": "No!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25087007": "It's because I've been thinking about all these unfinished goals and stuff...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25087008": "Didn't expect you to have sleepless nights like the rest of us.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25088001": "Have you seen Cellulo around?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25088002": "I saw it just now during dinner, roaming around the corridor...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25088003": "Well, actually, it was a Firefly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25088004": "Huh? Firefly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25088005": "Hehehe, looks like I pulled it off. I disguised a Firefly as Cellulo.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25088006": "You're not thinking of using a Firefly for something, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25088007": "Well... uh... risky filming stuff, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25088008": "No way! Absolutely not!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25089001": "I'm thinking about making my dormitory smaller.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25089002": "That's a really odd demand!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25089003": "Mainly because I prefer sleeping in a smaller bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25089004": "Especially the kind that's surrounded by cabinets, leaving only a small opening to get in and out of bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25089005": "Oh, that does sound like it would provide a sense of security.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25089006": "Exactly! It's really comfy to sleep in!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25089007": "I'll get the Fireflies to help you out with that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25089008": "Thanks a ton!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25164001": "These Fireflies deserve a thumbs-up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25164002": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25164003": "They always carry out my orders precisely, with no delays or shortcuts, and they never slack off.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25164004": "They're perfect servants. Too bad their talents aren't more widely utilized.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25164005": "You mean it's too bad they can't be utilized by you, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25164006": "Your sensitivity to such topics has sharpened.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25165001": "Esteemed PlayerName, do you require my assistance?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25165002": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25165003": "Perhaps I do...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25165004": "Hold on, are you trying to be the butler of the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25165005": "Absolutely, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25165006": "But I've already got Fireflies for that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25165007": "They can't shoulder the responsibilities of a butler yet—true butlers require a wealth of knowledge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25165008": "Not necessary—the Colossus isn't a mansion, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25165009": "Alright then, if that's your wish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25166001": "Would you like me to share some skills with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25166002": "About fighting? Nah, I'm good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25166003": "I'm talking about butler skills.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25166004": "That's even less useful to me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25166005": "Are you sure? Management is actually a fascinating art.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25166006": "Now that you put it that way, I'm actually getting a bit intrigued. I'll consider it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25166007": "Well then, come find me once you've made up your mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25167001": "I feel it's necessary for you to learn more about etiquette.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25167002": "Why is it \"necessary\"?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25167003": "Because you're the master of the Colossus, you'll inevitably be involved in interactions with diverse individuals.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25167004": "You'll have to attend various occasions, such as ceremonies in Lumopolis, meetings in Illumina, and events in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25167005": "It'll have a negative impact on you if you let etiquette slip.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25167006": "Is it really that big of a deal?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25167007": "Yes. Because in Astra, many still value their Social Impressions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25167008": "You have a point there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25168001": "I've realized that I hold a strong admiration for Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25168002": "What part of it do you admire?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25168003": "What led you to have this admiration?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25168004": "Because, as a butler, it's highly competent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25168005": "The way it manages Fireflies alone is enough to make me marvel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25168006": "But it's different from you. Its primary role is to command Fireflies while you manage servants and such.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25168007": "True. And I also have to correct the master's mistakes, which can be quite tricky.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25168008": "You two have strengths in entirely different areas, but both of you're exceptional as butlers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25168009": "Thank you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25169001": "I've heard about a particular technology in Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25169002": "What technology?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25169003": "It's a small-caliber bullet launcher, designed to be energy-efficient and lightweight...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25169004": "And it can be conveniently attached to different flying devices.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25169005": "Flying devices? Are you suggesting...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25169006": "That's right. So, how about allocating some funds to equip the Fireflies?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25169007": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25169008": "While it may not be very powerful, it can handle certain bothersome pests.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25169009": "I'll think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25253001": "Check out my baseball cap and bat.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25253002": "Starting the performance so early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25253003": "I'm going to play baseball! That's why I'm wearing a baseball cap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25253004": "But you wear it often, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25253005": "Not quite. My baseball cap is set at a special angle today!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25253006": "I can't tell the difference... but best of luck to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25253007": "Thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25254001": "I know it's still early, but I've got something to tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25254002": "Looks like you got into some trouble.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25254003": "Brilliant Caelestite! You guessed it right!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25254004": "It's not a guess—knowing your personality, something must have happened.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25254005": "Did you break a glass?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25254006": "Did you graffiti on a wall?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25254007": "No! I was practicing my throws this morning and accidentally hit a Firefly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25254008": "Ah!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25254009": "Good thing that other Fireflies carried it away. It's probably being repaired right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25254010": "From now on, you're not allowed to bring baseballs onto the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25255001": "Do you like the sound of wind chimes?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25255002": "I like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25255003": "They're okay, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25255004": "Why the sudden? You like the sound of wind chimes or something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25255005": "That's right. I love their tinkling. Sometimes, I wish I could hang a few on me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25255006": "Maybe they can even help me groove—\"Ding-a-ling, it's Sadie coming, Ding-a-ling, Sadie's got the swing.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_25255007": "Instead of that, why not just learn an instrument?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25255008": "But then I can't throw down the beats with my hands. Sigh, it's kinda frustrating.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25256001": "I'm done with eating at the Colossus lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25256002": "So you skipped breakfast too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25256003": "That's right! Those Fireflies dropped off a plate of veggies. Didn't touch a single bite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25256004": "Veggies are good for you, you know? They help to keep your nutrition balanced...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25256005": "You know what? You really sound like those naggy grandpas in Umbraton sometimes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25256006": "Used to think the Colossus was a quiet spot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25256007": "... Fine, whatever you like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25257001": "You've been to plenty of places, so you must've seen some Illumina accessories, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25257002": "Does Illumina have accessories? Aren't they all military uniforms and stuff?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25257003": "I mean, the star thingy they all have?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25257004": "You mean the symbol of Illumina...? What about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25257005": "I just wanna pin one on my clothes—it'll look so cool!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25257006": "If you mess around with these things, it might not sit well with folks from Illumina—just a heads-up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25257007": "You made a good point...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25383001": "PlayerName, I saw a rainbow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25383002": "How's the cargo?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25383003": "It was gorgeous. Reminds me of those dazzling lights.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25383004": "Like Illumina's signal lights or those attention-grabbing ads in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25383005": "Sometimes, I could literally gaze at them for an entire day...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25383006": "So you were watching that rainbow for quite some time, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25383007": "That's right. I kept watching until it disappeared.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25384001": "What's whistle candy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25384002": "It's a pretty common type of candy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25384003": "Why's it called that though?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25384004": "Because you can blow all sorts of sounds through it, which is also why kids love it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25384005": "Plus, they come in many colors, so you'll always find one you like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25384006": "I'm making sure to get one and see what it tastes like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25384007": "Never heard of it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25384008": "Since it's candy, it should be really sweet, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25384009": "I'll taste it for sure whenever I get the chance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25385001": "PlayerName, do you like coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25385002": "I like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25385003": "I don't like it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25385004": "What's your take on coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25385005": "To me, coffee is something unique.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25385006": "It smells amazing, but the bitterness in the flavor—not my thing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25385007": "What if you add a lot of sugar to it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25385008": "Then it wouldn't be real coffee anymore, you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25385009": "That makes sense...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25386001": "I want to say thank you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25386002": "For what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25386003": "For keeping the Colossus free of bugs—I really appreciate it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25386004": "Bugs bother you a lot, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25386005": "When I first arrived at the Colossus, the sight of those worn walls had me pretty anxious.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25386006": "But now, it seems like I can relax and settle in on the Colossus since there aren't any bugs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25386007": "Seems like... you really do hate bugs a lot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25387001": "Do you enjoy rainy days, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25387002": "I like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25387003": "Can't believe it! You actually like rainy days!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25387004": "I don't like it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25387005": "I get the feeling you're not a big fan of rain.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25387006": "Because everything gets all damp when it rains, which makes me quite uncomfortable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25387007": "In those days, I had no choice but to quietly bear that agony.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25387008": "It's reached the point of agony, huh... you really hate it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25387009": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25388001": "Saw my Cubes playing with Fireflies today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25388002": "Huh? They can get along and play with each other?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25388003": "They were having a speed race—I saw my Cubes falling behind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25388004": "Speed race? Like, one was running while the other was chasing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25388005": "You're right. Guess that's another way to look at it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25388006": "Please don't chase after the Fireflies!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463001": "I'm looking to buy some models.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463002": "Armor models?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463003": "Weapon models?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463004": "That's not it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463005": "I mean those body figure models—I saw some in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463006": "They're wooden and have different key body parts marked on them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463007": "Sounds like something meant for research...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463008": "I want to practice first aid on them—Lord Raphael said it's really helpful!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463009": "I heard they're not cheap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463010": "Huh? Really?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25463011": "Well, I'll give it more thought then. See you later!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25464001": "Something feels missing on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25464002": "What do you think it is?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25464003": "A touch of nature's breath.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25464004": "I see. You're thinking of getting some potted plants, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25464005": "The power of Caelestite! You just read my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25464006": "That's horrible!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25464007": "Isn't that an easy guess...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25465001": "Do you think Fireflies are just like birds?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25465002": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25465003": "Is it because they both can fly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25465004": "What made you think of this all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25465005": "Maybe... It's because I was thinking about the birds I used to raise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25465006": "Seeing things that can fly just naturally triggers those thoughts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25466001": "Don't send the Fireflies to my room anymore, please.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25466002": "Starting from this afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25466003": "Yep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25466004": "Are you looking for some quiet time for yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25466005": " Not really. Mainly because I think cleaning the room is something I should do myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25466006": "Keeping things clean all the time is an essential quality for a medic.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25466007": "Consistently depending on others to do such things will lead to laziness over time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25466008": "I really admire your diligence! Keep it up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25467001": "I need to borrow your Colossus to put together a medical team!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25467002": "Why!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25467003": "Because the Colossus moves fast! That means the medical team can promptly respond to and assist the injured across different areas.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25467004": "That makes sense...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25467005": "Alright, let's get things rolling in the afternoon! I'll start by outlining a plan!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25467006": "Hang on a second! There's much more to take into account, like staffing, resources, supplies, and such.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25467007": "Didn't think it'd be so complicated...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25467008": "It takes time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25467009": "Alright, I'll think about it more. I'll just practice first aid in the afternoon for now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25584001": "Having a Colossus is truly wonderful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25584002": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25584003": "Because you can just go wherever you want.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25584004": "You like roaming around, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25584005": "It's not aimless roaming! I'm talking about travel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25584006": "Going to different cities, enjoying diverse sceneries, meeting new faces...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25584007": "Just thinking about it gets me all excited!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25584008": "I gotta try it if I ever have the chance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25585001": "As an idol, it's my duty to protect my fans!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25585002": "Why would you say that all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25585003": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25585004": "Because! Fans are what make idols thrive!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25585005": "In a way, idols are everlasting as long as there are fans!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25585006": "That's quite an intriguing theory.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25585007": "Yes, that's exactly why protecting and caring for fans is an idol's responsibility!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25586001": "Marshmallow owes you a big thanks, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25586002": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25586003": "The spacious corridors on the Colossus allow Marshmallow to run around as much as it likes!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25586004": "Sometimes, it even chases Fireflies around for fun, and I once saw it bringing a spoon for them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25586005": "Looks like Fireflies are also quite fond of Marshmallow, since they were using a spoon to play the fetch game with it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25586006": "I guess Marshmallow was just giving Fireflies back the spoon they dropped...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25587001": "PlayerName, make sure not to let Fireflies bring me any sweets, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25587002": "You don't like sweets?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25587003": "It's not like that. I'm just trying to watch my weight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25587004": "No problem.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25587005": "It's part of the job, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25587006": "Right, one of the essential trainings for idols.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25587007": "In a way, it's not just about the body, but also a training for willpower...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25587008": "So, there's no room for any kind of slackness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25587009": "That's quite demanding.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25588001": "Join me in my performance, won't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25588002": "Performance?! What can I do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25588003": "Aren't you able to manipulate that \"Light Trail\" thing? You can use it for light and shadow effects, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25588004": "I can only see the \"Light Trail\"...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25588005": "That's enough! You're a born lighting artist!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25588006": "We're talking about totally different things here...Besides, being a lighting artist requires a lot of experience, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25588007": "The atmosphere on stage, the rhythm of the music, and things like that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25588008": "That's why you should join me! One show will be enough for you to learn all of those!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25588009": "But I have no experience, Goldie!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25588010": "No worries! You can totally handle it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25589001": "Why on earth does bitter melon have to exist in the world?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25589002": "Sounds like you got a bite of it, didn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25589003": "Exactly! A chunk of bitter melon got mixed into my dinner, and I didn't notice it until after I swallowed it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25589004": "So, now I've got this bitterness lingering in my mouth... Can't even get a minute of sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25589005": "I remember there should be water in your room, so maybe you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25589006": "Already drank it all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25589007": "Huh?! That's a big jar!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25589008": "Yup. But I can still taste the bitterness in my mouth!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25589009": "You... it's probably psychological.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25663001": "Are those Fireflies considered animals?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25663002": "That's not it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25663003": "What's your take on that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25663004": "They look a lot like machines, yet they possess remarkable wisdom.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25663005": "They can be quite amusing sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25663006": "So, I think they might be some sort of wondrous beast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25663007": "Is that actually the case?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25663008": "It is if you believe so.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25664001": "What do you tend to do when you're free?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25664002": "I enjoy the scenery.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25664003": "I wander around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25664004": "Looks like there are quite a few places on this Colossus for some alone time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25664005": "Looks like you enjoy being alone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25664006": "Mainly, I enjoy that leisurely feeling—thinking about nothing and doing nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25664007": "It's a great way to rejuvenate and regain energy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25664008": "Well... it's not about regaining energy; it's more of a hobby.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25665001": "I'm in the mood for a drink.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25665002": "It's still noon—alcohol may not be a good idea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25665003": "How about just a few sips?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25665004": "Drinking during the day makes me wanna sleep in the afternoon, resulting in insomnia at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25665005": "Well, I don't have such a problem. But there's no booze in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25665006": "Seems like I'll have to check the warehouse...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25665007": "Alright, just don't drink too much!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25666001": "I heard my little furball got some complaints today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25666002": "Yes, from the Fireflies—your little furball chased them for the whole morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25666003": "It made Fireflies unable to work—even lunch was delayed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25666004": "No wonder lunch was so late today...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25666005": "Hmm, I should really discipline it, for the sake of my lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25667001": "Curious, what's your favorite animal?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25667002": "A sudden question—I can't tell, I mean... It's a bit hard to decide.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25667003": "As I suspected, it's Fireflies, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25667004": "No, definitely not! They're mechanical.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25667005": "Yet, at times, their actions are really like creatures'.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25667006": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25668001": "Mind if I ask, do you shed hair often?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25668002": "Why are you asking me that? I'm not some kind of animal...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25668003": "Caelestites and Aurorians both shed hair, particularly from their heads.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25668004": "You mean going bald, don't you? I don't think I'm at that age yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25668005": "But why are you asking me this?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25668006": "Mainly because I've noticed you staying up late often, which got me a little concerned.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25668007": "But it's midday now... It's not even nighttime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25668008": "This is what they call \"being proactive.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_25783001": "Remember to put on your sunglasses.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25783002": "Sunglasses? At night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25783003": "Exactly, put on your shades before bedtime. That'll prevent the glaring sunlight from bothering you the next morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25783004": "But sleeping with sunglasses on is really a hassle. They slip off too easily when you turn your head.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25783005": "Are you such a restless sleeper?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25783006": "I'll snap a few photos later to make sure! Maybe I should go ahead and release an exclusive news piece... I've already got the perfect headline in mind!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25783007": "How about \"The Mysterious Sleep Postures of the Caelestite\"?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25783008": "Never!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25784001": "Ugh, the sound can be so darn annoying!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25784002": "Sounds?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25784003": "Annoying? What are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25784004": "What's going on here?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25784005": "You see, clicking the shutter makes a sound, which tends to startle the targets I'm shooting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25784006": "Then they'd scatter away, making my precious shots go poof...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25784007": "I've heard about this new device in Illumina that can capture photos silently. Wish I could have one like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25784008": "Handy for sneaky shots, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25784009": "It's all for work, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25785001": "Got any juicy gossip? Especially about what's happening on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25785002": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25785003": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25785004": "I'd advise against nosing around too much on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25785005": "Since you're already here, why not take the opportunity to relax a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25785006": "No way!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25785007": "For me, this isn't work; it's pure relaxation!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25785008": "Looks like this is your thing, huh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25786001": "Wrote a complete book of notes today!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25786002": "That much?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25786003": "That's why I haven't slept yet—still sorting things out!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25786004": "Sort out your own notes? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25786005": "I used shorthand for those notes, So I need to take my time and turn them into proper records.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25786006": "Shorthand?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25786007": "Many times, when there's a need to record a substantial amount of information rapidly, this method comes in handy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25786008": "Basically, my sentences are formed using various abbreviations and symbols, which only I can understand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25786009": "It's also an essential skill for the job, something that's used during almost every interview.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25786010": "Impressive!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25787001": "Interested in taking on a part-time job?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25787002": "What job?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25787003": "Delivering newspapers in Umbraton. And the pay is quite good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25787004": "Anyone can do that job, right? So why did you choose to ask me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25787005": "Because you attract attention!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25787006": "We can brand it like the \"Special Deliveries by the Mysterious Caelestite\" and such.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25787007": "So you're trying to use me as a gimmick, huh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25884001": "It's getting pretty late, young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25884002": "You're still not asleep, Zhong Xu?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25884003": "Been thinking about that chess game I saw today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25884004": "A chess game? Between whom?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25884005": "My bad, I meant a chess set.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25884006": "Well, tell me about it. Seems like you're really intrigued.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25884007": "The stone used to make the chess set seems rare and precious, and its engravings were absolutely exquisite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25884008": "Its design has got pure Astra style. But just as I was hesitating, someone else bought it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25884009": "What a pity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25884010": "All I can say is, it wasn't meant to be mine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25885001": "Young friend, what do you believe is the significance of cultural relics?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25885002": "The legacy of culture?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25885003": "The testament to history?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25885004": "I believe each relic offers a form of conversation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25885005": "Conversation?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25885006": "Most of the time, cultural relics offer us a window to traverse through time and witness what the artisan wished to convey...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25885007": "In a sense, it's like having a conversation across time and space.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25885008": "I find what you say is really... romantic.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25885009": "That's also why I collect them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25886001": "Have you ever seen a Seres Vase before?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25886002": "You mean porcelain?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25886003": "Yes, my young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25886004": "What's that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25886005": "Porcelain. It's a collectible from the Longzhou, brought here across the seas.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25886006": "I've seen one in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25886007": "Looks like folks in Astra are quite fond of it as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25886008": "After all, that delicate, smooth texture... It's really something special.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25886009": "I've heard many folks can't get enough of it, even after looking at it for days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25886010": "After all, it's a work of art crafted with the sweat and toil of artisans.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25887001": "How would you feel if I presented you with a bed as a gift?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25887002": "Why are you suddenly giving me a gift...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25887003": "The material of the bed on the Colossus is quite unique, but it lacks that cozy warmth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25887004": "From that perspective, a wooden bed could be more comfortable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25887005": "The wood comes from the wilderness, and even though it has a metal scent due to the processing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25887006": "The inherent natural aura within still remains.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25887007": "I heard that the Caelestites appreciate natural things, so I thought you might enjoy it as a gift.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25887008": "But I'm already used to the bed on the Colossus. I mean, I've been sleeping on it for over a decade.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25887009": "I see. Sorry for being blunt.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25888001": "What if we add a porcelain ornament to your room? How does that sound?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25888002": "Sounds wonderful!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25888003": "I didn't expect you to have such a fondness for porcelain.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25888004": "Because it's really beautiful, especially that sheen... making it quite popular among many.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25888005": "But once the price comes to mind, I begin to have second thoughts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25888006": "You can't have it all in life. Looks like we need to think about it twice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25888007": "It's a bit difficult...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25888008": "Why's that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25888009": "Mainly because it's too expensive, and in case it breaks, even Fireflies can't restore it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25888010": "I see your point.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25889001": "Do you hear any cat noises?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25889002": "No. Did your cats go missing or something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25889003": "It's just that they've been running around here and there lately. I hope they don't disturb or startle you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25889004": "No need to worry. We already have plenty of things running around on the Colossus anyway...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25889005": "Such as Fireflies and all sorts of pets brought by our friends.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25889006": "Haha, life on this Colossus sure is quite interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25984001": "The night breeze... It's pleasantly chilly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25984002": "Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25984003": "But it's actually a little too chilly for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25984004": "Are you enjoying the night view?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25984005": "Yes. Besides, it's also a captain's habit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25984006": "I have to constantly monitor the wind direction out on the open seas and make swift adjustments as necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25984007": "But you're on the Colossus now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25984008": "It has become a habit. Sometimes, I catch myself doing it without even realizing it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25984009": "The Colossus can adjust itself automatically. You can rest assured and enjoy yourself here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25985001": "It's just perfect for carving during the night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25985002": "Carving?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25985003": "Yes, carving wood into different shapes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25985004": "Especially on silent nights, hearing the pleasant \"swoosh, swoosh\" of the carving knife...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25985005": "Why do I find that a bit creepy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986001": "Do you find the Colossus is similar to a ship?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986003": "Even though one soars in the sky, and the other sails on water.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986004": "However, there are many shared principles between the two...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986005": "Not really...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986006": "Oh? Really?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986007": "Why are you asking that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986008": "It's just I often feel that piloting a ship may have some similarities with flying a Colossus, so...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986009": "I get it! You want to pilot the Colossus, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986010": "You've got it right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25986011": "I think it's fine if it's just some basic piloting...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25987001": "Can you fly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25987002": "How is that possible?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25987003": "Absolutely! Every Caelestite can fly!",
  "str_quest_chat01_25987004": "You must be joking, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25987005": "Seems like you've guessed it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25987006": "What made you ask that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25987007": "Sometimes, when I stand on the Colossus and gaze at the sky, it feels like watching the sea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25987008": "And I'd think that if you were to fall, someone who can fly would be like someone who can swim...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25987009": "Their odds of surviving would be greater, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25987010": "The Colossus always lands safely. You don't need to worry too much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25988001": "I'm suddenly in the mood for some river snail noodles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25988002": "At this hour? May not be a good idea...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25988003": "Well, in some markets in Longzhou, they sell river snail noodles even in the dead of night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25988004": "You're quite a fan of it, huh? What makes it so appealing to you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_25988005": "The distinctive taste of river snail noodles. It's something I could talk about non-stop for three days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25988006": "I should stop talking about it; it'll only make me want it more. Goodnight, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25988007": "Goodnight, Mu Yuebai.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25989001": "I must say, this Colossus is remarkably steady.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25989002": "Moments ago, a powerful night wind swept through, but there was no unsettling movement whatsoever.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25989003": "If we were on the sea and didn't handle it skillfully, the waves from such a strong wind...",
  "str_quest_chat01_25989004": "A whole ship might flip over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25989005": "The Colossus is probably used to such a wind level, considering it was originally designed for flight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_25989006": "Is that so? Then, it's truly astounding to think about the expertise of the Colossus builders.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26064001": "I find the balance scales in Astra quite interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26064002": "What made you talk about this now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26064003": "I observed local merchants using balance scales to weigh medicinal herbs, and they were entirely different from my scales.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26064004": "Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26064005": "I heard others say that this reflects the entirely different thought patterns of Astra and Longzhou folks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26064006": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26064007": "Yes, I didn't quite get it myself, but it's somewhat fascinating, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26064008": "As long as they can weigh things, that's all that matters to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26064009": "That's right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26065001": "What snacks do you have on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26065002": "Coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26065003": "Milk.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26065004": "Didn't you just have lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26065005": "But the two you just mentioned are both beverages, not snacks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26065006": "So, what exactly counts as a snack?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26065007": "It's food that helps you pass the time when you're bored.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26065008": "Well, if you savor coffee and milk slowly, they can also help you alleviate boredom.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26065009": "You have a point. I'll try it out now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26066001": "I gave Firefly some special attention today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26066002": "What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26066003": "I petted it in the same way you'd pet a cat.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26066004": "Actually, the Firefly I petted is quite adorable. When I touched it, it kept fluttering its wings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26066005": "So I'm considering whether to adorn them with some accessories, you know, ones looking like little cat ears.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26066006": "When did you get those cat ears?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26066007": "Someone put them here, I guess? They seem to be some kind of... new trend in Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26066008": "You really lost me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26066009": "Fine, I won't put cat ears on the Fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26066010": "And you should also cut down on petting the Fireflies; they have work to do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26067001": "Oh... I'm feeling a bit drowsy. Maybe I ate too much for lunch just now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26067002": "Take a nap then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26067003": "Can't do that; I still have some medical books to complete.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26067004": "No need to rush. You can finish reading later. Besides, I seem to recall someone saying it's not good to read right after a meal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26067005": "Something like... your mind would become sluggish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26067006": "Let me see if the medical book has anything to say about it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26067007": "Oh! It's true!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26067008": "I'll go take my nap now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26068001": "Any plans to have the Colossus land in the mountains lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26068002": "Not for now, why do you ask?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26068003": "See if I can find any special herb in Astra, you know, for my experiments.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26068004": "You could just buy them in Umbraton. They have everything you need.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26068005": "But I heard there's fake stuff in Umbraton. No one's really regulating them, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26068006": "Plus, when it comes to herbs, it's better to search for, identify, and collect them in person.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26068007": "I see your point.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26068008": "So, if you ever plan to land in the mountains, be sure to let me know!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26069001": "Is there any kind of square or open space on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26069002": "The Bridge, perhaps?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26069003": "No, I guess...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26069004": "What's on your mind?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26069005": "A gathering! We can all get together and have a feast!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26069006": "Good idea! Even when we're not on the Colossus, we can still find a nice spot with a view and enjoy food together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26069007": "Perfect! That way, I can taste the yummy dishes everyone brings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26069008": "Oh, so that's what you had in mind...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26154001": "What would it look like if the Colossus kept flying upward?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26154002": "It would always be the sky, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26154003": "I have no idea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26154004": "Why the question?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26154005": "I just have this thought every now and then, and it's quite interesting to think about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26154006": "If it went way up there, maybe we wouldn't even see land anymore, you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26154007": "All around, as far as the eye can see, there's nothing but endless sky...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26154008": "I don't think there's a place like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26155001": "If you had some free time, what sort of book would you like to read?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26155002": "History.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26155003": "Novels.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26155004": "What type of books do you usually read, Jeriah?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26155005": "Philosophical books.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26155006": "Sounds like quite the intellectual challenge...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26155007": "They are necessary sometimes, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26156001": "These \"liver snacks\" are a real treat, aren't they?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26156002": "You eat this stuff for breakfast usually?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26156003": "You bet, little Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26156004": "It's a bit... unconventional.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26156005": "The world's full of unconventional things, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26156006": "Sometimes, if I skip these snacks, I can't get anything done all day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26156007": "Well, as long as you like 'em...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26157001": "My friend is missing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26157002": "Your friend? You still half-asleep or somethin'?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26157003": "You wouldn't want a giant python in your room, would you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26157004": "Check under your bed or in your closet, you might just spot it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26157005": "Fireflies would have spotted it already if it were in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26157006": "Since the Fireflies are still quiet, it must still be in your room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26157007": "You have a point. I'll keep looking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26158001": "How about conducting a social observation on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26158002": "What kind of social observation are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26158003": "It's about observing our friends' reactions, like how they're gonna react when we ask them to exchange rooms or stuff like that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26158004": "Isn't that just messing folks around?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26158005": "In a way, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26158006": "That doesn't sound cool.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26158007": "But being able to see everyone's reactions is still pretty useful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26158008": "Forget it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26159001": "Down for a contest?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26159002": "What contest?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26159003": "A flying contest!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26159004": "I'll have my Hawk to race with the Colossus and see which one is faster!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26159005": "Well... if the Colossus fly too fast, we might feel sick.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26159006": "Then how about we see which one can fly higher?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26159007": "Do we really have to have a contest?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26159008": "Come on, air races are a real treat to watch, and they don't happen often.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26159009": "It's still early in the morning... Let's just get some more rest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26253001": "I'm thinking of putting a bell on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26253002": "A bell? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26253003": "To tell the time accurately. Many times, we don't know what time it is, and it's a bit inconvenient.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26253004": "The bell ringer... let's have Fireflies do that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26253005": "Instead of that, we might as well have Fireflies broadcast the time regularly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26253006": "That's a great idea!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26253007": "But it could mean more work for Fireflies, so I'll think it over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26254001": "I want to install a mailbox on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26254002": "Below the Colossus' neck?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26254003": "Nailed to the entrance?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26254004": "Hold on! Why do you want a mailbox all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26254005": "To send and receive letters, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26254006": "Who'd be sending mail to the Colossus? We don't even have an address!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26254007": "Ah... you're right. I didn't think it through.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26254008": "I apologize!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26254009": "It's cool...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26255001": "What do you think of the name \"Courier Union Colossus Division\"?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26255002": "Sounds good!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26255003": "Sounds a bit plain...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26255004": "When was this division set up? Why haven't I heard about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26255005": "Just a moment ago! I already put up the sign at my door!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26255006": "You're very efficient.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26255007": "Once I get confirmation from the other senior members, it'll be official!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26255008": "So it's still not official now... Well, good luck with that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26256001": "Is there a wristwatch on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26256002": "There might be. You lookin' for one?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26256003": "I saw a wristwatch in Umbraton last time, so expensive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26256004": "I suppose the wristwatches in Umbraton are expensive mainly because of those shiny decorations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26256005": "Oh, now that you mention it, Illumina seems to have some cheap wristwatches.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26256006": "But those wristwatches look a bit rugged.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26256007": "As long as they work, that's good enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26257001": "How about I get some flying gear strapped on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26257002": "What kind of flying gear?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26257003": "There's a courier in the Rediesel Desert who's got a flying backpack—that one looks dope.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26257004": "Sounds like it might be difficult to control. What do you want it for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26257005": "It can help save some energy during long-distance flights.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26257006": "This way, I can deliver more mail.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26257007": "Your sense of duty is off the charts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26258001": "Are you up yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26258002": "Yes, I'm up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26258003": "Good habit! Try to keep it up, man.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26258004": "You seem to be an early bird too, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26258005": "I'm used to waking up early because I want folks to get their mail ASAP.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26258006": "Got a bunch of mail to deliver today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26258007": "You got it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26385001": "How's your sleep been lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26385002": "It's been pretty good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26385003": "Not so great...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26385004": "Why the sudden question? How about you, Tina?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26385005": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26385006": "Tina?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26385007": "Tina!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26385008": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26385009": "Looks like you have no sleep issues at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26386001": "The novel... I can't finish it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26386002": "Relax, take your time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26386003": "But I've been reading for a long time, and I want to get to the next one soon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26386004": "But life's been crazy lately, so I always fall asleep while reading.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26386005": "You're not falling asleep right now, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26386006": "Huh? No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26386007": "Actually, the time you've spent chatting with me—if you used it to read...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26386008": "Oh, right! I'll get to reading now. Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26386009": "Huh? Just like that? Alright, goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26387001": "I always feel so sleepy. It's super annoying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26387002": "Right, it can screw things up sometimes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26387003": "Have you tried any methods to stay sharp?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26387004": "Sigh, I've tried a lot of stuff since I was a kid, but none of it ever worked...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26387005": "I see. Feels like you need someone to watch over you at all times.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26387006": "Watch over me? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26387007": "In case you fall asleep in the wilderness or some dangerous place...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26387008": "No need to worry; I won't actively go to such places anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26387009": "That's reassuring.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26388001": "What do you usually do in your free time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26388002": "Sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26388003": "Go for a walk.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26388004": "But Tina, I think you'd choose to sleep most of the time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26388005": "How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26388006": "Because you are always sleeping, even during the day...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26388007": "I don't sleep that much, but I do take quite a few daytime naps.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26388008": "Speaking of which, I'm feeling a bit sleepy right now, so I'm off to bed. Goodnight!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26388009": "I knew it... Goodnight, Tina.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26389001": "Is there any way to record dreams?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26389002": "Narrate them right away after waking up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26389003": "Well, that could work... but sometimes when I wake up, my head's all fuzzy, and I can't remember anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26389004": "You know how dreams are—they're often forgotten in a flash.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26389005": "I get it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26390001": "Have there been any new mystery stories lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26390002": "You're asking the wrong person... You might as well check in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26390003": "But I heard those merchants in Umbraton can sell anything at a high price, even trash.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26390004": "They can make rocks sound like gold, so I bet even plain stories would be mind-blowers in their mouth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26390005": "Well, that's just how things roll in Umbraton. You'll have to take your time and find them yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26390006": "Based on my time and energy... sigh, can I ask you for help?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26390007": "Me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26390008": "It seems like you know your way around Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26390009": "But there are many tasks for me to handle on the Colossus as well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26390010": "Well, it seems I'll have to take my chances and go there myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463001": "Do you like cooking?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463002": "I like it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463003": "It's alright, I guess...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463004": "I don't like it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463005": "Looks like you're pretty into cooking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463006": "Yep, mostly because I can think things over while cooking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463007": "Thinking things over? Isn't that likely to end up ruining the dish?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463008": "Maybe I'm a bit unique; I always feel that my mind calms down when I cook.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463009": "And many things I didn't figure out before would suddenly become clear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463010": "Sounds like cooking is your mind regulator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26463011": "It probably is.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26464001": "How much do you know about the current genres of detective fiction?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26464002": "What genres?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26464003": "No idea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26464004": "Not sure if I've been reading detective fiction too much...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26464005": "Like the mystery, realistic, crime, pure detective, surreal detective...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26464006": "Yep, you've read too much of it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26465001": "Can I keep some flowers on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26465002": "Sure, as long as it's not too many.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26465003": "Thanks! I'm just thinking about decorating my dormitory with a couple of potted plants; they won't bother anyone else.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26465004": "You can put some in the corridor too. I do it sometimes as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26465005": "It shouldn't be a bother to anyone. And if there is any issue, we can always have the Fireflies relocate them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26465006": "Got it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26466001": "I'd like to ask, who is in charge of the Colossus' repair work?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26466002": "Fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26466003": "Wait, they are in charge of that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26466004": "You seem quite surprised.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26466005": "Indeed. I always thought these Fireflies were just little diligent handymen.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26466006": "I didn't realize they could handle such tasks... Repair work requires some pretty advanced expertise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26466007": "Oh, you're talking about the advanced repair work? Sometimes, it may be beyond Fireflies' reach.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26466008": "It requires other specialized talents, and it depends on the damaged area. Sometimes, the Colossus can even command the Fireflies to do the repairs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26466009": "I see... That's truly impressive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26467001": "When it's cold, what do you prefer to use to stay warm?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26467002": "Inside the Colossus, temperature isn't really a concern...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26467003": "What about when you're traveling outdoors?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26467004": "Blanket.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26467005": "Duvet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26467006": "Comforter.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26467007": "What's your preference?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26467008": "I prefer blankets. Even though they can be a bit scratchy and heavy, they're really warm.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26467009": "There's this magical sense of comfort as soon as I wrap myself up in it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26467010": "As long as you feel comfortable, that's what matters.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26468001": "Do the Fireflies need repairs?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26468002": "Huh? Is any of them broken?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26468003": "No, just curious, because there must be times when they break, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26468004": "Other Fireflies will repair the broken ones, and sometimes, you can take them to Lumina Storage for fixing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26468005": "Seems like you don't need to handle such things yourself, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26468006": "That's right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26468007": "This is amazing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26468008": "Nah, no biggie.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26468009": "The Colossus is truly incredible!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26468010": "Uh... Ahem, you can say that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26553001": "Yo!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26553002": "Still in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26553003": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26553004": "Congrats to me! I've caught a creature that'll tidy up my room!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26553005": "I'm naming this creature \"Matthieu's Marvel,\" and it'll be in Lumopolis textbooks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26553006": "I'll become the most renowned biologist in Lumopolis, no, the world, etching my name in history forever!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26553007": "Hold on... that \"creature\" you mentioned, is it round, white, and can fly, by any chance?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26553008": "Oh? How'd you know that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26553009": "Those are the Fireflies on the Colossus! They're not creatures at all...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26553010": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26554001": "Today is perfect for a day off.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26554002": "Got any recommendations for a good place to go today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26554003": "How about the beach?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26554004": "Ugh! Who'd want to swim in those dirty, salty waters?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26554005": "How about exploring the deep mountains?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26554006": "Ugh! Who'd want to walk on those muddy, bumpy paths?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26554007": "Definitely not me, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26554008": "I knew I couldn't count on the taste of you commoners.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26554009": "I think I'll just head back to my elegantly designed, exquisitely decorated estate for my leisure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26554010": "Isn't that just staying at home?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26563001": "I haven't broken a sweat today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26563002": "I'm feeling just as fresh in spirit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26563003": "Have you been cooped up in your room all day?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26563004": "Humph, don't make \"embracing alone time\" sound so off-putting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26563005": "Too bad you missed the chance to meet Schwartz.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26563006": "Wh-What? Did the City Lord drop by just now? Has he left?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26563007": "He left just a little while ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26563008": "Such an excellent opportunity to meet the City Lord... Why didn't you tell me earlier?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26563009": "I have to change my outfit! And I'm heading after him right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26563010": "Argh, drat, I'm already sweating...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564001": "Everyone here seems to lack good taste, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564002": "Seriously, what kind of friends are you making, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564003": "Huh? What made you say that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564004": "No one in the Colossus noticed the dazzling emerald on my chest!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564005": "Not a soul noticed it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564006": "Nobody asked about the gem's value...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564007": "Nobody gave me jealous stares...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564008": "Perhaps everyone had other matters of greater concern.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564009": "Sigh, never mind. After all, they're just commoners; it's perfectly normal for them to lack discernment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564010": "If you ever find the time, do come and take a look at my gem.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564011": "Guess I can tell you about what makes my gem so exceptional.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26564012": "O-Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583001": "There's nothing better than bathing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583002": "Petal baths, bubble baths, red wine baths, milk baths... I like them all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583003": "Wait, can you really have so many variations of baths?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583004": "Is this considered many? Truth be told, I'm getting a bit tired of them lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583005": "PlayerName, do you Caelestites have any special bathing customs?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583006": "I think I've heard of something...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583007": "Mud baths",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583008": "It's said to be good for whitening and skincare!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583009": "Chili baths",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583010": "It's said to detoxify and aid in weight loss!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583011": "Need I prepare it for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583012": "No, thanks... it's practically murder!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26583013": "It's a solace known only to commoners, the idea of bathing with such stuff...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584001": "Yo!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584002": "Can you send another \"Matthieu's Marvel\"... I mean, a Firefly over?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584003": "I need an adorable Firefly for my laundry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584004": "Yes, it's doable...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584005": "But aren't there already five Fireflies in your room?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584006": "Five won't be enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584007": "You do the math. I need one to maintain indoor hygiene, one to tidy up the bed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584008": "...One to clean the bathtub, one to iron my clothes, and one to help me with my hairstyle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584009": "See? Don't you think I still need one for the laundry?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584010": "...Indeed, looks like you do need an extra one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584011": "Hold on, you almost had me there. One Firefly is already enough to handle all these tasks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584012": "These five are all occupied with continuous day-long work; there's no time left.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584013": "...Let them have a break; I'll send you some new ones.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26584014": "Hmm, that sounds about right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656001": "Morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656002": "Morning! Sleep well last night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656003": "Been sleeping fine lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656004": "'Cause the bad dreams are gone?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656005": "Yes, the inner demons no longer haunt me. I can finally relax.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656006": "'Cause no more troubles on your mind?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656007": "Yes, even though my parents are gone, I know they loved me. That's all that matters.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656008": "But mostly, it's 'cause I feel safe here with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656009": "No need to worry about anyone coming to hunt me down, or about me losing control and harming others.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656010": "It would be even better if your other friends could be a bit quieter and not always come to talk to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26656011": "Haha...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657001": "Scratch, scratch... Hey, get up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657002": "Hati, you're such an early bird. I'm still sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657003": "Too bad.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657004": "The morning air is great. In the soil and the bushes, there's a unique smell.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657005": "Wanna check it out, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657006": "Unique smell in the soil? Really?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657007": "It's hard to express in Universese, but if I had to, if I had to, it's like...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657008": "It makes me wanna dig into the bushes and taste the soil beneath.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657009": "Huh?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657010": "It's just a way of description. Don't worry; I won't actually taste it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657011": "That's reassuring. Hati, you know what? The actions you were describing make you sound like a good puppy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26657012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26662001": "Will there be stewed meat for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26662002": "Uh... didn't we just have stewed meat for breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26662003": "Stewed meat is just too good. I could have it ten times a day and still crave more.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26662004": "But I'm afraid others might get fed up with it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26662005": "Oh, really? I never thought there'd be someone who dislikes stewed meat.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26662006": "Uh, well... there's a solution, though.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26662007": "If we use different spices for the stew every time, it might prevent others from getting sick of it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26662008": "Got it. I'll go talk to Grimme. She's bound to have some ideas.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26662009": "PlayerName... Th-Thank you for thinking of a solution for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663001": "The taste of meatballs at lunch... it's so strange.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663002": "Really? Hahaha... How come? What do you find strange about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663003": "PlayerName, your reaction is the strangest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663004": "I can smell a whiff of dishonesty on you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663005": "I'm so far away from you. How can you smell anything on me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663006": "Don't underestimate my nose.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663007": "Alright... to keep everyone's nutrition in check, I mixed in some spinach in today's meatballs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663008": "That explains it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663009": "If you don't feel like eating it, I can get you something else!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663010": "It's okay; I just wanted to make sure. Thankfully, it's not red cabbage...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26663011": "Food is a blessing; I'll finish every morsel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686001": "Did you eat enough for dinner?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686002": "Yep, I'm stuffed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686003": "Didn't you eat enough?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686004": "No, I'm not really full.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686005": "I can't eat more, though, or Vice will give me another lecture on self-control...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686006": "Too bad.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686007": "I grilled some chicken thighs with my own flames, and they turned out quite tasty.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686008": "Even crispier than those from regular ovens.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686009": "Since you're not coming to join me, I'll go ahead and gobble them up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686010": "Quit talking about them, or I'll get tempted!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686011": "Wait... hold on, save me a piece, please.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686012": "...I've already finished 'em all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26686013": "That was too fast!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687001": "Hey... that sweet drink you had the Fireflies deliver to me, what was it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687002": "Oh, that was coconut water!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687003": "I... assumed it was regular... sugary water.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687004": "Well? Did it taste good?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687005": "It's delicious, no doubt... but coconut water... has a hypnotic effect on me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687006": "Oh, really? Sorry, I won't share it with you again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687007": "No!!! I... I love coconut water the most!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687008": "Gulp... gulp...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687009": "Coconut water is my favorite... yum yum... and I want... more...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687010": "Hati? Your reaction... it's like you're drunk or something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26687011": "Quite unexpectedly, I've glimpsed Hati's adorable side...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754001": "Good morning! How did you sleep last night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754002": "Yes, I had a good sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754003": "Still feeling a bit tired.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754004": "You know, Kristen, you're pretty caring.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754005": "Oh, really? Maybe I'm just used to greeting people this way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754006": "But don't get me wrong; it's not a soulless social ritual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754007": "If it bothers you, I can cut down on the greetings...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754008": "Kristen, what I meant is... I really admire how you always care for others.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754009": "It's one of your strengths; no need to change for anyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754010": "PlayerName... Thanks for your understanding!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26754011": "Have a great day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755001": "Good morning, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755002": "Morning... how do you manage to be so lively every morning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755003": "Because I've got a secret trick!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755004": "I've told Tina before, but it had no effect on her at all...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755005": "Tell me about it; maybe it'll work on me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755006": "Well, since you're insisting... alright.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755007": "When you don't feel like getting out of bed in the morning, just start humming a song—your singing will rouse you entirely.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755008": "Because once your throat wakes up, the rest of your body will follow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755009": "That sounds pretty challenging...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755010": "You've got to try it sometime!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26755011": "O-Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764001": "Good afternoon; it's really turning out to be a great day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764002": "Yes! I'm a bit curious, Kristen. Do you ever have bad days, Kristen?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764003": "Of course, there are some bad days... But why are you curious about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764004": "It's because, Kristen, you have a way of describing things so positively.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764005": "For example, even if the lunch today doesn't suit your taste, you still say it's \"a great day.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764006": "About lunch... you noticed, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764007": "I'm sorry. I was raised not to be picky about others' hospitality.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764008": "I really wish some of my friends who always nitpick about their food could take a lesson from you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764009": "But I think Kristen, you can treat this place like your own home; no need to be so formal all the time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764010": "At home, I'm held to even higher standards…",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764011": "I get what you mean, PlayerName. And you're so sweet!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764012": "I'll make sure to keep it in check from now on, so you won't see my formality, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26764013": "Th-That's not what I meant...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26765001": "Hi there!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26765002": "I'm sorry to bother you, but may I ask you how to deal with different individuals?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26765003": "Huh? Why do you ask that? Have you run into some trouble?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26765004": "It's not exactly trouble, but the work in the Hall of Justice is more complicated than I imagined...",

  "str_quest_chat01_26765006": "I had no idea before that interacting with others could be this draining.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26765007": "But in your Colossus, you always have friends from all over the world, each with their unique character...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26765008": "So, I believe you must have some tricks for dealing with others!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26765009": "I... I really don't have some secret tricks, but if I had to sum it up...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26765010": "It might be \"sincerity.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_26765011": "It might be \"adaptability.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_26765012": "Your response really matches your style, PlayerName.",

  "str_quest_chat01_26783002": "PlayerName, how about you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783003": "I'm still swamped...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783004": "You've been working so hard!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783005": "It's quite unusual to find someone working harder than I do...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783006": "I've just finished up too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783007": "You've kept working to this hour as well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783008": "In any case, take care of your health.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783009": "I used to learn how to brew health-boosting herbal tea. I can bring some to you when I have the time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783010": "Can't believe you actually learned such stuff, Kristen!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783011": "Back in the day, my family made sure I grasped the essentials of being a proper lady.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783012": "I never imagined it would come in handy now. Please don't make fun of me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26783013": "I won't!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784001": "It's nighttime again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784002": "Finally, I can spare some time to read!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784003": "What kind of books are you into?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784004": "I'm open to reading all types of books, but my favorite is still those about opera!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784005": "...Funny how, as a child, I was compelled to learn singing and stage acting, but I inwardly resisted it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784006": "But now, they have turned into pastimes that bring me happiness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784007": "Maybe art is inherently a joyful pastime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784008": "!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784009": "You're absolutely right! Art itself is a source of happiness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784010": "I really couldn't appreciate that when I was a child.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26784011": "Oh, enough about these things... I wish you a good night's sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801001": "There's a kind of birds as small as Aoha, so I'll refer to them as Aohas.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801002": "Big Aohas are maternal. They work hard to build a nest and scrounge food for baby Aohas.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801003": "But there's another kind of very big bird that would invade Aoha nests.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801004": "They throw baby Aohas out and pretend to be the big Aoha's children.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801005": "But the unsuspecting big Aoha will still feed her babies' murderers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801006": "Those birds are despicable!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801007": "Why couldn't the big Aoha tell the difference?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801008": "Maybe because she was blinded by love.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801009": "Do you think some people couldn't recognize their own child, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801010": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801011": "Emotions can impact judgment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801012": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801013": "Aurorians are different from birds.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801014": "That makes sense!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801015": "Mothers could adopt the wrong children, but would the children also adopt the wrong parents?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801016": "Perhaps I should learn from you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801017": "Fact or fiction is judged by true intent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26801018": "You make better decisions than I do, Yingel. You got this!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26802001": "Busy today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26802002": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26802003": "Wanna hang out in the Illumina War Room? Just... just consider that an invitation from a friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26802004": "The War Room... Is that where you work? Of course! I couldn't be happier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26802005": "All right, I'll wait at the Lumina Grid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26802999": "Go and meet up with Yingel!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841001": "I'm Yingel, Senior Intel Officer for the Illumina Committee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841002": "Should I provide a more detailed introduction?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841003": "Uh, no, that's fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841004": "There's no need to be so formal, it's just a casual chat.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841005": "Understood.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841006": "My job demands proper, rigorous statements.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841007": "Perhaps you felt pressured by that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841008": "However, I believe we'll have many more opportunities to communicate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841009": "Yes. I'll try to get to know you better, Yingel!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841010": "I spent most of my time in the War Room learning to get along with myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841011": "If you see me as a friend, I'll gladly share my personal information with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841012": "As an intel officer, sharing information is a show of sincerity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841013": "Oh, there's one piece of information I'd like to know!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841014": "What style of room do you like? You can pick whichever vacant room on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841015": "Cozy, blue room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26841016": "Hmm, I think it'll be nice to stay here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842001": "I'm practicing my shooting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842002": "I neglected it for a while, so I'll have to exert myself to catch up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842003": "Was it because you were too busy with work?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842004": "Correct.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842005": "It's you, who reminded me that a weapon is like a teammate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842006": "Constant communication is needed to maintain rapport.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842007": "I did learn a lot from our time together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842008": "Heh, I'm flattered.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842009": "Flattered... Is it because of my compliment?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842010": "Yes",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842011": "Actually, it's you who are insightful and a fast learner, Yingel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842012": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842013": "It's because you said you learned from our time together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842014": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842015": "I'm off to train and evaluate my progress. We'll talk again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842016": "I'll see you later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26842017": "You go get 'em!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843001": "My mind has been crystal clear recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843002": "Issues I found problematic before have all been resolved.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843003": "Does that mean you progressed again, Yingel?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843004": "Prior to meeting you, I thought I'd reached my limit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843005": "I would run into the occasional bottleneck when I try to improve myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843006": "And I wouldn't know what to do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843007": "Because I didn't know when the next bottleneck would hit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843008": "Well, why not just take a break?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843009": "Since you're stuck for a while anyway, why not pause and recharge yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843010": "Yes, I came to realize that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843011": "Your outlook probably allowed me to stop and smell the roses without any pressure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843012": "That's how my mind sorted itself out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843013": "You must be under a lot of pressure with your job, Yingel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843014": "Feel free to come to see me on the Colossus whenever you feel you're at a loss!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26843015": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844001": "Would you like to learn how to fire a sniper rifle, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844002": "My marksmanship has improved greatly as of late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844003": "Sniping sounds hard.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844004": "That means hitting the target from a long distance, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844005": "Yes. Long-range precision is the standard by which a sniper is judged.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844006": "But it goes beyond merely aiming before pulling the trigger.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844007": "You must first assess the target's condition.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844008": "It could be moving or currently stationary but moving the second after.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844009": "So when you are aiming, anticipation is the key.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844010": "So how can I anticipate a target's movement?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844011": "In normal range, a bullet will hit in three to five seconds after pulling the trigger.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844012": "You need to anticipate whether the target would change tracks based on what they're doing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844013": "Focus all your attention when shooting and do not breathe.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844014": "Breathing will affect the accuracy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844015": "Once you learn that and practice hard, you'll be a good sniper.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844016": "Got it. I get the impression that you must be very good, Yingel!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844017": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26844018": "I won't be able to do that at all...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26851001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26851002": "Morning... Ah, you're such an early riser, Yingel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26851003": "I'm used to getting up early.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26851004": "Discipline is a basic requirement for Illumina soldiers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26851005": "So when did you get out of bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26851006": "Before sunrise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26851007": "Let me look at the time now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26851008": "Whoa, still so early in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26851009": "Pardon me, but I'd like to go back to sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26852001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26852002": "I just woke up... And good morning to you too, Yingel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26852003": "Today is going to be a smooth day with your greeting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26852004": "Heehee. What's on the slate for you today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26852005": "I have to review some battle reports.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26852006": "Useful battle data can be obtained after running calculations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26852007": "That sounds amazing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26852008": "In that case, I won't bother you then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26852009": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26853001": "Good morning. Did you sleep well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26853002": "Not bad!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26853003": "Any plans for today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26853004": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26853005": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26853006": "Is there anything I can help you with, Yingel?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26853007": "Doesn't talking to you count?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26853008": "Don't be nervous, I'm just checking on you as a friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26853009": "Oh, okay, okay...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26854001": "Aoha is flying all over the room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26854002": "It's exceptionally exciting in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26854003": "That's natural for birds.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26854004": "Does it sing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26854005": "Yes. I know it's time to get up when I hear Aoha's loud chirps.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26854006": "So Aoha is a living alarm clock!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26854007": "That's an interesting way to put it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26854008": "It's also my family too, though.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26855001": "Good morning. Did you sleep well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26855002": "It was very nice!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26855003": "PlayerName is peppy, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26855004": "I went to bed earlier than usual, so I woke up fully rested and energized!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26855005": "Exercise in the morning for the best result.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26855006": "I would take a morning jog sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26855007": "Okay, I'll exercise next time! For sure!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26856001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26856002": "I noticed there's milk on the breakfast menu.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26856003": "I remember you're a fan of dairy products, aren't you, Yingel?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26856004": "Yes, but from my observations, there are a bunch of lactose-intolerant passengers on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26856005": "That's why I brought some special soy milk from Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26856006": "Just to make sure those who can't handle milk still get their dose of nutrients.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26856007": "Yingel, you've put a lot of thought into this... Thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26856008": "Not a big deal. It's something I should do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26857001": "Good morning. What's the plan for today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26857002": "Keep working hard, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26857003": "Same here, my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26857004": "Relax and unwind!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26857005": "Yes, you've been quite busy these days; it's time for a good break.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26857006": "Are you gonna rest up today, Yingel?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26857007": "I don't really need to.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26857008": "Only hard work brings me inner peace.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26857009": "Hope we both make some progress today, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26861001": "What should I eat for lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26861002": "Cheese bread or garden salad?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26861003": "Cheese bread!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26861004": "Garden salad!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26861005": "I choose cheese bread!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26861006": "I guess that's your choice all along...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26861007": "I do like cheese more!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26861008": "Well, at least that gave you an option for lunch too, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26862001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26862002": "Afternoon, Yingel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26862003": "I have a committee meeting to attend this afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26862004": "Are you nervous about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26862005": "Nervous? I've not been for a long time now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26862006": "Attending meetings is something I'm very used to, like eating.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26862007": "Well, I hate meetings myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26863001": "Do you like brain games, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26863002": "Such as puzzles, chess, sudoku...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26863003": "Are you thinking about playing these with me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26863004": "I'll be crushed for sure...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26863005": "We won't know until we've tried.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26863006": "I can teach you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26863007": "Hey, how come you're not responding...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26864001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26864002": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26864003": "Daydreaming.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26864004": "Contemplating.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26864005": "Not busy today, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26864006": "Are you busy today, Yingel?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26864007": "I finished work for the day this morning, so I'm free and open.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26864008": "Being busy isn't how you measure productiveness, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26864009": "Strongly agreed!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865001": "A midday greeting to you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865002": "What do you do during your breaks?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865003": "Why are you asking this?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865004": "During breaks, I play some puzzles, do Sudoku...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865005": "The thing is, I've already solved all the puzzles and Sudoku I have—not sure what to do next.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865006": "Maybe consider some light reading?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865007": "The cafe's got a stash of enjoyable reads, though they might not contain useful knowledge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865008": "I've never heard of books like that before...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865009": "How about trying out some games?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865010": "The Rec Room's got a bunch of fun video games!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865011": "Video games? I haven't really played them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865012": "I'll go check them out right now. Thanks, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26865013": "You're welcome!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26866001": "A midday greeting to you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26866002": "Is something going on? Why is the Colossus so quiet now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26866003": "It's probably because everyone's taking a midday nap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26866004": "Midday nap...... I see; they like taking a nap after lunch, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26866005": "Yep, Yingel, don't you need a little shut-eye to recharge?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26866006": "Not really, I'm not quite used to this... way of resting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26866007": "Even when I'm on the bed, there's no drowsiness at all, so I'll just keep on working.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26866008": "Oh, my apologies, PlayerName. Am I disturbing your nap?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26866009": "I'll leave you alone now. Good day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26866010": "Good day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26881001": "Are you in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26881002": "Not yet. My stomach feels somewhat empty...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26881003": "Have a glass of warm milk.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26881004": "I love dairy products. The rich flavor brings comfort.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26881005": "I think warm milk can make you sleep well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26881006": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26881007": "All right, good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26882001": "Oh, it's evening already.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26882002": "I sometimes feel a day goes by especially fast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26882003": "As if an intangible train is taking us to destination unknown.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26882004": "Am I on that train too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26882005": "Everyone is on the train, just that they're in different cars.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26882006": "And we met in a same car.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26882007": "Now, we're passengers passing each other...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26882008": "What I'm trying to say is, I approve you as my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26883001": "Are you in bed, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26883002": "Not yet, Yingel. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26883003": "There's something I'd like to talk to you about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26883004": "Can we please label whether the drinks have carbonation in the future?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26883005": "I downed a whole bottle by mistake, and now I can't stop hiccupping.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26883006": "It's really unpleasant to have no control over my body like this...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26883007": "My apologies; I'll have Fireflies label them more clearly!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26883008": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884002": "It's late; Yingel, you're still awake?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884003": "According to your schedule, you should be in \"deep sleep\" by now, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884004": "That's right, PlayerName, I've always been able to adhere to my sleep schedule.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884005": "But today, I'm suffering from insomnia, which isn't something that happens often in my life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884006": "I thought maybe you might have some good methods for dealing with it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884007": "How about trying counting sheep?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884008": "I've heard about this one; you just need to picture a lamb in your mind and quietly count...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884009": "\"One sheep, two sheep, three sheep, four sheep, five sheep...\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884010": "Yup, that's the trick!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884011": "...Yingel?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26884012": "After counting only to five, you fall asleep already?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26901001": "I heard in the Cafe that you wanted to practice sword fighting?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26901002": "Yes, I want to learn it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26901003": "No, I was just kidding.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26901004": "If you really want to learn, I can be your training partner.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26901005": "Thanks, but I think just a dummy will do for my level of expertise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26901006": "Regardless of what you want to train in, remember to find an experienced training partner.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26901007": "Novices are prone to mistakes, and repeating the errors will only lead to the opposite effect.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26901008": "A training partner helps to correct those mistakes and gives the proper guidance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26901009": "Sure, I'll come to see you when I want to practice sword fighting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26901010": "Anytime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902001": "I spent an hour daydreaming today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902002": "Daydreaming? That doesn't sound like you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902003": "Yeah, that doesn't, does it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902004": "But I noticed you do it every now and then, so I gave it a go.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902005": "Ahem, I was actually in deep thought.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902006": "Oh? So it's the stupid look that threw people off?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902007": "Okay, I sure didn't expect that one from you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902008": "Heha, just kidding.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902009": "Fine, I do space out sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902010": "But that's because it'll help me ponder problems.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902011": "Sometimes I'd overlook the real issue when I get busy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902012": "Letting the mind wander helps me recollect and reevaluate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26902013": "I'm convinced. It seems I must spend more time daydreaming.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26903001": "I just saw you dozing off in the Lounge. Have you been busy lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26903002": "So it was you who put the blanket on me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26903003": "Yes. Feel free to let me handle any problem you find difficult.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26903004": "You helped me so much that I've been turning to you every chance I got.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26903005": "I'm glad you feel that way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26903006": "No, no, I have to solve issues on my own.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26903007": "But we're friends, and friends look out for each other.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26903008": "A true friend is someone you can rely on, no matter what.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26903009": "I'm so happy to have a dependable friend like you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26904001": "Sorry, I can't take you to see Twilight today. We'll have to plan for another day instead.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26904002": "Don't worry about it. Did anything happen?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26904003": "The Ironthorn Knights are in a severe shortage of supplies, and I must go back and take care of the problem.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26904004": "Sounds tricky, how can I help?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26904005": "Um... If you come with me, maybe they'll be friendlier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26904006": "Eh? Who?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26904007": "Chop chop. Let's move! I'll wait for you on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26904999": "Head over to Leo at the Bridge and help resolve the supply shortage for the Ironthorn Knights.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941001": "Salutations from Captain Leo of the Ironthorn Knights.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941002": "Hello, I'm PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941003": "So this is the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941004": "It's my first time seeing such an enormous yet intricate aerial vehicle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941005": "It'll perform very admirably in border skirmishes!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941006": "May I use your Colossus for battle, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941007": "Uh, I don't think so.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941008": "It has no combat capabilities, but most importantly—",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941009": "The Colossus is my home... no, it's not just a home.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941010": "To me, it's a parent, mentor, and pal all rolled into one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941011": "So I can't hand the Colossus to anyone else.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941012": "I beg your pardon, it was presumptuous of me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941013": "Regardless, it's an honor to fight alongside you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26941014": "Likewise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942001": "Another successful raid!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942002": "Congrats!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942003": "I picked up a fine knife for you as a token of my gratitude.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942004": "Huh? What are you thanking me for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942005": "Although you're younger than me, I must admit I've learned a lot from you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942006": "Particularly in commanding a battle, you opened my eyes to new perspectives.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942007": "I just make suggestions using my natural psychic talent, that's all. You're a true leader and strategist.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942008": "Mighty yet staying humble, that's another thing I just learned from you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942009": "Hahaha. So, when can we stop praising each other and talk normally?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942010": "Well, may I invite the Caelestite to our victory party in a few days?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26942011": "Won't miss it for the world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26951001": "I'm afraid I can't continue to stay aboard the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26951002": "Huh? How come?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26951003": "I would never want to fight if I kept staying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26951004": "Maybe because you don't need to fight here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26951005": "It's too peaceful and will mislead me into believing this is how life should be.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26951006": "But on the other hand, maintaining peace is the reason we fight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26951007": "That's probably what makes soldiers commendable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26952001": "Good morning. Do you have any knife-maintaining oil? Mine is running out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26952002": "Knife maintaining oil? What's that for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26952003": "To protect the blade from rust.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26952004": "I didn't know such a thing existed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26952005": "Yes. Blades required extensive care.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26952006": "They will turn brittle and unreliable without regular cleaning and maintenance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26952007": "An unreliable weapon is deadly for the wielder in battle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26952008": "I'll check around for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26952009": "Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26953001": "I plan to rearrange the room since I have nothing much to do today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26953002": "Any ideas?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26953003": "Hang a map on the wall and put a military sandbox on the table.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26953004": "Is that for formulating strategies? I usually see you with a map in hand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26953005": "Yes. One can learn a lot from studying march routes and terrain positions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26953006": "Come see me if you need a detailed map.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26953007": "I'll mark the important elements for you, including contentious terrains and hidden passages.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26953008": "If only treasure maps are marked in the same way...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954001": "Morning. I found military literature on the Colossus. May I borrow them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954002": "Of course. Not many people read military books here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954003": "Have you read them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954004": "I love reading.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954005": "We'll have a lot more in common to talk about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954006": "I don't measure anywhere close to you in actual battle experience, so please be patient.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954007": "You're too modest. Your command expertise is likely unparalleled.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954008": "I'm not too keen on it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954009": "Military literature is actually very interesting and can help you master the nuances of a battle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954010": "Maybe I'll try to read it one day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26954011": "It's never too late to start learning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26955001": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26955002": "Borrowed the Rec Room this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26955003": "Sure, no biggie.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26955004": "But Leo, I didn't expect you to be so into fun early in the morning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26955005": "Haha, I went there for my regular workout.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26955006": "Oh, and I patched up those ripped sandbags for everyone too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26955007": "Oh, actually, you can tell me, and I'll handle it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26955008": "A simple task; didn't take long.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26955009": "After all, you've got more important stuff on your plate, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26955010": "Well, maybe... Thanks, though!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26956001": "Morning, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26956002": "Are you up? Do you need my help?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26956003": "I just woke up, still a bit groggy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26956004": "Hmm... Your help? With what, Leo?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26956005": "I can go to your room and sound the Ironthorn Knights' reveille.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26956006": "It'll make your hair stand on end and wake you up immediately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26956007": "Huh?! No, it's fine... I'm wide awake already!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26956008": "Haha, that's good to hear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26956009": "Get your spirit up and enjoy the brand-new day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26961001": "According to the notice, water will be turned off this afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26961002": "Yes, the pipes are undergoing maintenance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26961003": "We stored up several big buckets full of water in the Cafe and Lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26961004": "Just help yourself if you need water.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26961005": "That works. It would be unbearable not to have bath water to wash the stink off after the drills.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26961006": "I once read an article on how ancient soldiers cleaned themselves in war.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26961007": "They'd rub spices, vinegar and such on their bodies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26961008": "That sounds like a good idea to avoid smelling on a long march.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26962001": "Ran into any difficult problems recently?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26962002": "Feel free to pass them on to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26962003": "Do you have a lot of free time on hand lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26962004": "No, I just wrapped up a campaign against the Eclipsites.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26962005": "Then you should take a break.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26962006": "I am, which is why I need some problems to keep my mind sharp.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26962007": "No, what I mean by that is to do nothing and just chill out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26962008": "Studying strategies, sword training, and problem-solving is how I spend my downtime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26962009": "Every one of those sounds exhausting...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26963001": "Time to pass out provisions again. I really don't want to deal with it. Such a headache...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26963002": "There's something Captain Leo wanted to avoid after all, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26963003": "Supplies to the border are too tight this time, it's only enough for a month.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26963004": "So what are you going to do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26963005": "To solve the ration shortage, I'm sending a squad out to hunt.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26963006": "The Colossus can help with provision delivery from the rear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26963007": "Thanks for the offer. I'll take you up on that if necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26964001": "We knights usually stage recreational competitions. I hope you can participate someday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26964002": "Sure. What kind of competitions are they?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26964003": "Shoot apples, throw darts, hoop toss, and so on, all fun activities.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26964004": "The Ironthorn Knights know how to have fun!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26964005": "That's one of the things I'm proud of!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26964006": "The members came from different classes and family backgrounds.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26964007": "But we're all united and fighting as one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26964008": "Because everyone shares the same goal, and that's to defend our homeland.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965001": "Things still going well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965002": "Really well!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965003": "Seems like you've got your work under control and don't need me to pitch in.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965004": "This may seem simple, but it is actually a highly valuable and rare ability.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965005": "Not going that well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965006": "Keep in mind, if anything goes wrong, you can always come to me for help.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965007": "Thanks, but I don't want to be too dependent on others.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965008": "...Especially someone as skilled as you, Leo.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965009": "With that kind of mindset and determination, I believe you can handle any challenge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965010": "You got it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26965011": "Sure! Thanks a lot, Leo!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26966001": "A midday greeting to you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26966002": "Good day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26966003": "I took the liberty and made a detailed map for your Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26966004": "And based on it, I've designed 10 emergency defense plans against intrusions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26966005": "But I'm not certain if you'll need them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26966006": "Yes! I need them badly!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26966007": "Well, that's good to hear. But do keep the Colossus map safe, and don't let it get into the wrong hands.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26966008": "Leo, you've thought about this so meticulously... Understood!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26981001": "Say, have you gone to bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26981002": "Not yet. Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26981003": "I just noticed a fluffy cushion on the chair in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26981004": "Oh, Vice passed that out to everyone to make sitting more comfortable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26981005": "It's indeed more comfortable, but I'm not used to it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26981006": "Can I give it to Joseph? He likes fluffy things.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26981007": "Sure. It belongs to you, so you can do whatever you like with it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26982001": "Have you been staying a lot on the Colossus at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26982002": "Well, there isn't anything special going on lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26982003": "A circus just pulled into Twilight and they put on a show every night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26982004": "It's rare entertainment for us. The whole town wants to see it, and the tickets sell like hotcakes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26982005": "But let me know if you're in Twilight soon, I can get you a pass.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26982006": "Have you seen it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26982007": "Yeah, I took the knights and everyone was happy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26982008": "That sounds like an awesome show... I'm tempted to go now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26982009": "I'll have my deputy send you some tickets.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26982010": "Thanks, but let's wait until I'm sure I'm going.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26983001": "Permission to use the kitchen to make jerky when there's no one around at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26983002": "Haha, hankering for late-night snacks?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26983003": "No, I want to prepare rations for Ironthorn Knights' expeditions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26983004": "We're starting long-range combat training in a few days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26983005": "We need more rations than usual, so I have to use the kitchen when no one's around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26983006": "Please feel free, but watch out for the late-night alley cats that want to steal food.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26983007": "If they're into unseasoned jerkies, sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26983008": "That doesn't sound appetizing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26983009": "Jerkies are easy to carry and easy to keep. Taste and flavor aren't the points.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26983010": "Okay, I guess I won't be stealing any, then...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984001": "It's getting late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984002": "PlayerName, you seem wide awake. Anything bothering you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984003": "Nah... I'm just getting ready to hit the bed!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984004": "Haha, that's a relief.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984005": "But if you ever have anything on your mind, I'm here to listen, anytime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984006": "You know, in the dead of night, memories just flood in.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984007": "But it's okay, I've gotten used to it... Sorry for making you concerned!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984008": "PlayerName, it seems you're not quite ready to open up to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984009": "That's not true!",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984010": "You're already busy leading the knights every day, and yet you make time to care about others... you must be exhausted, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984011": "Haha, these two things don't really conflict for me. Thanks for caring. So...",
  "str_quest_chat01_26984012": "Get some rest now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_26985001": "Is that a coconut drink that came with dinner, by any chance?",
  "str_quest_chat01_26985002": "Yep, that's it!",

  "str_quest_chat01_26985005": "It's a distant memory, but I had a taste of luxury back then.",

  "str_quest_chat01_27001016": "Mostly it's Bubble, but occasionally something else.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27001017": "Such as a little Eclipsite that I saw sneaking into the kitchen for food on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27001018": "You mean Toto?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27001019": "So that's its name, eh.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27001020": "May I take a look at your artwork, Anatoli?",

  "str_quest_chat01_27003006": "Now's not the time to talk like that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27003007": "Having said that, I might know where the book is.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27003008": "You left a red-covered book on the table when you passed by the Lounge just now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27003009": "Ah!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27003010": "No wonder I couldn't find it anywhere in the room. It turns out it was in the Lounge!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27003011": "I'm in the Lounge now. Need me to bring the book over?",

  "str_quest_chat01_27003999": "Anatoli is waiting for you to grab a book he left in the Lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041001": "In my time working with you, I learned many new things.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041002": "Such as how Caelestites and Aurorians could coordinate in battle, special ways to apply Caelestite powers, and so on...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041003": "I think I'm better in combat than before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041004": "And I got to know you better too, Anatoli.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041005": "You're so cool with how you snapped your fingers every time before using Luminatics.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041006": "Did that impress you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041007": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041008": "I tried to do that many times and couldn't even make a peep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041009": "But you did it so effortlessly, even wearing gloves... How did you do that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041010": "Ah, busted.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041011": "Actually, the noise was simulated, by Luminatics.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041012": "You could do that with Luminatics?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041013": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041014": "Using Luminatics to create finger snaps sounds like a waste, though...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041015": "But it left an impression on you, didn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041016": "True! And it looked very cool!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041017": "It's also a calling card unique to only you, Anatoli!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041018": "You think so? That's wonderful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041019": "It means a lot to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041020": "Huh? Why do you say that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041021": "Whether it's recon or intel, we must keep a low profile most of the time to gather information.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041022": "We attract as little attention as possible to stay alive and complete our tasks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041023": "But that also means we're often forgotten.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041024": "To me, being remembered is a rare occasion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041025": "Not to mention the number of powerful and distinctive friends around you, whereas I'm just a plain Aurorian.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041026": "Is that so...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041027": "But worry not—",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041028": "I know you now, and I'll never forget you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27041029": "Thanks, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042001": "I want to ask you a question, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042002": "What is it? I'll do my best to answer!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042003": "Do you think a person can be replaced?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042004": "Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042005": "Yes",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042006": "From a global perspective, everyone can be replaced.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042007": "The world won't stop just because that someone is gone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042008": "No",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042009": "To me personally, nobody is replaceable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042010": "Everybody is important and one of a kind!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042011": "Why do you ask, Anatoli?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042012": "Is this part of intel gathering?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042013": "No, it's one of the personal questions I've been pondering.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042014": "I've worked with you for some time now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042015": "You invested much time, effort and resources in me over the period to improve the partnership.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042016": "It benefitted me as I could feel myself improving, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042017": "Isn't that a good thing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042018": "Just keep hammering and make yourself even stronger!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042019": "And that's the point I want to make...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042020": "As an equivalent to a commander, you've worked with many Aurorians.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042021": "Therefore, I think you understand as well as I do that I have limits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042022": "No matter how hard I strive, I'll never reach the level of Grand Marshal Reinhardt or Commander Hiiro.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042023": "Regardless of the tough battle, they can always provide powerful backup, even turning the table completely.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042024": "That's something I can never give you, try as I may.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042025": "I think, given the circumstance, there will come a day when I can no longer assist you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042026": "Thus, for future battles, instead of squandering resources on me, I think you should reallocate them to someone who can help you long-term.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042027": "That might be logical, but...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042028": "I did it purely out of my own decision.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042029": "I chose you because I believe you can help me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042030": "...!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042031": "It's a decision I made after careful consideration, not a snap judgment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042032": "I believe in your abilities, so will you trust my decision, Anatoli?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042033": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27042034": "I trust you, Navigator PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051002": "Oh, morning, Anatoli.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051003": "I just got up and am still in a daze.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051004": "Anything urgent about seeing me this early in the day?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051005": "This is when you get out of bed, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051006": "I believe I received false information. Sorry to disturb you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051007": "It's all right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051008": "I actually stayed up last night, that's why I got up late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051009": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051010": "I must also take whether PlayerName stayed up the night before into consideration from now on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051011": "Okay, whatever floats your boat...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051012": "Would you mind cutting it out...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051013": "You make my downtime a subject of analysis...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051014": "And that makes me feel like I'm an endangered species or something!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051015": "Doesn't the only Caelestite on Astra count as endangered species?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051016": "Uh... Why you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051017": "What do you want with me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051018": "Nothing special, I just wanted to confirm whether you're up or not.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051019": "This confirmation revealed an error in my report, which I have now corrected.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051020": "Is it necessary to nitpick like that...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051021": "Of course it's necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27051022": "Only by validating your daily routine can I deliver the intel you need most to you at the appropriate time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052002": "I heard you're looking for me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052003": "Where are you, Anatoli? Still on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052004": "I'm on the deck. What can I do for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052005": "So that's where you are!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052006": "Come back, it's time for breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052007": "It's blowing hard on the deck. What are you doing there?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052008": "Catching sunrise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052009": "I didn't know you'd be interested in that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052010": "It's not for pleasure. I'm just pondering some questions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052011": "Something bothering you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052012": "I heard some say the name Anatoli means sunrise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052013": "So I kept wanting to find out why my parents gave me this name.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052014": "A shame they passed away long ago and I'll never get a chance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052015": "Therefore, I'm trying to put myself in their shoes, watching the sunrise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052016": "Have you figured out anything yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052017": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052018": "Although I'm not sure about their idea behind it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052019": "Would you like to hear my theory?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052020": "Please elaborate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052021": "I think they did it as a wish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052022": "Wish?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052023": "They lived in a period fraught with long nights...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052024": "And they were hoping for peace that comes with the dawn...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052025": "So their child would live carefree without concerns.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052026": "That's why they gave you the name.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27052027": "Ah...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053001": "May I take some of the leftover breakfast pastry with me, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053002": "Sure thing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053003": "Are you still hungry?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053004": "Should I make more food?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053005": "That's not necessary. I'm just going to feed the fish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053006": "Oh, that reminds me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053007": "You do have a fish. What's it called now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053008": "Bubble.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053009": "The sawdust buns from Illumina are too hard for it to consume.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053010": "Very true...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053011": "I even heard rumors of the buns being used to hammer nails.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053012": "Yes. That's why I always have to scrounge for something it can eat.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27053013": "Hope it'll like these pastries.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054002": "Wow, what a coincidence. I just opened my eyes and saw your message pop right up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054003": "Well, it's not a coincidence.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054004": "Huh? Did you install surveillance in my room?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054005": "No need for that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054006": "I've already gathered enough information about your sleep patterns.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054007": "With just a little analysis, I can infer the time you wake up under different circumstances.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054008": "This... this is a bit creepy, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054009": "Creepy? It's just part of being an Intelligence Officer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054010": "But it's like I have no secrets in front of you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054011": "Don't worry. If it's something that doesn't affect the well-being of all the Aurorians, I'll keep it for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27054012": "Thanks a lot...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27055001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27055002": "Morning! Is breakfast to your liking today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27055003": "Thanks for caring, PlayerName. I really enjoyed today's breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27055004": "Because Bubble seems really happy with it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27055005": "Eh, Anatoli, did you not eat? Should I send another breakfast over for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27055006": "No need, I have Illumina's provided bread.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27055007": "Too much food in the outside world messes with my judgment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27055008": "I need to keep my mind calm and sharp.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27055009": "Anatoli, you're never one to relax, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061001": "It's noon again, when the light is brightest and shadows are shortest...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061002": "Yeah, you're right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061003": "I believe your Luminatics is based on shadows.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061004": "You must find this time annoying, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061005": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061006": "This is not the Dark Zone and there are much fewer Eclipsites around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061007": "I can gather enough intel even through basic means.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061008": "Why use shadows?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061009": "I hardly know any other Aurorians who would activate Luminatics through shadows.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061010": "It's out of desperation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061011": "In somewhere like the Dark Zone, it's easier for me to hide my trail using shadows than light.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061012": "Making it back alive with information was of utmost importance to the then-recon me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061013": "Wouldn't it be misconstrued?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061014": "Using shadows sounds like something the Eclipsites would do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061015": "Oh, sorry, I'm not accusing you of anything bad!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061016": "It's okay.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061017": "People usually get spooked when they see me projecting shadows with Luminatics for the first time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061018": "Some even mistook me for an Eclipsite that looked like an Aurorian.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061019": "Sure, it brought me occasional hassles...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061020": "But as long as I could bring back more info to keep more soldiers alive on the field...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061021": "I really didn't care what they thought of me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27061022": "I appreciate that very much...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062002": "Uh, Anatoli...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062003": "About the group photo Brandy took on the spur of the moment last time...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062004": "It's available.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062005": "Really? Can I see it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062006": "You can, but...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062007": "It didn't come out well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062008": "What do you mean by that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062009": "I mean, it was shot at noon under the bright light...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062010": "And you have a pale appearance, and white hair...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062011": "It wasn't until the photo was developed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062012": "That your face came off like a giant glow in the picture.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062013": "The whole head was completely blank.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062014": "Brandy said it was called overexposure...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062015": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27062016": "Anatoli?",

  "str_quest_chat01_27063004": "Such as reading.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063005": "I'm taking my time going through the many interesting books Queen Bethlehem recommended to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063006": "Such as playing games.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063007": "Gronru and Sinsa love playing games too, so we often play into the night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063008": "Such as listening to music.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063009": "The ultra-pop star Goldie just released a new album that I look forward to hearing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063010": "How about you, Anatoli?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063011": "Any interest other than your fish?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063012": "Observing others, if I must say.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063013": "What kind of hobby is that...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063014": "Observing a stranger's speech and behavior, collecting information on the person, analyzing their patterns...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063015": "Then predicting the target's next move and see if it's accurate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063016": "To me, it's a recreation as well as a way to hone my observation skills.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063017": "No wonder you'd stand in one place without a word... you were observing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063018": "Right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063019": "That sounds exhausting to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063020": "Ever considered a new hobby like gardening?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063021": "Vice gave me a potted plant yesterday, so I'm making that a new hobby.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063022": "I'm watering it as we speak.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063023": "Right this second?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063024": "I suggest you don't do that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063025": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063026": "According to the report, watering plants at noon is likely to cause them to wither or even die.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27063027": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27064001": "Good afternoon.",

  "str_quest_chat01_27064004": "I've really made you think that? I apologize...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27064005": "Even as an Intelligence Officer, there are moments when I genuinely care about my friends.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27064006": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27064007": "My bad, it's on me. You were just being caring, Anatoli, and I didn't respond well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27064008": "It's okay.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27064009": "At the very least, PlayerName, I'm now aware that you have some basic self-protection instincts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27064010": "Huh? You're still collecting my intel, aren't you?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065001": "Hello, PlayerName.",

  "str_quest_chat01_27065003": "Huh? How come there are no more messages after the last one?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065004": "Anatoli... Are you okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065005": "I'm totally freaked out!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065006": "I'll check on you right away!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065007": "Oh, turns out you tend to care for those around you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065008": "Stop with the nonsense...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065009": "I won't chat with you again next time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065010": "Oh... Turns out you're more focused on your own mental well-being.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065011": "You finally replied! But what do you mean by all this?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065012": "I'm sorry, PlayerName, I was just gathering your reactions to unexpected situations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27065013": "Not again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081001": "It's nighttime again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081002": "According to the report, this is when you usually turn in, right, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081003": "Yeah, I'm going to bed after reading this book!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081004": "What about you, Anatoli?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081005": "I'll turn in after feeding the fish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081006": "Feeding the fish before bedtime? Is that alright?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081007": "For us, we rest in the evening. But for Bubble, it gets active after nightfall.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081008": "In other words, it's a nocturnal creature.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081009": "That's rare...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081010": "It used to live in the Dark Zone after all, so it's not out of place for it to have unusual traits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081011": "I saw it spitting bubbles nonstop one night. It sounded like a telegraph.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081012": "Can it be some sort of wondrous beast?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081013": "Like Fia's Kyllo.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27081014": "Based on the intel I have, it's just a normal fish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082001": "It's getting dark...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082002": "Yeah, it's very late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082003": "This is when I'll reminisce about fighting in the Dark Zone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082004": "I know about the place!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082005": "Always dark, Eclipsites everywhere, suffocating Darkflow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082006": "Were you assigned there on duty?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082007": "No, I requested it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082008": "All my superiors and war buddies freaked out when I forfeited the chance to stay in Gannon in favor of the transfer request.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082009": "I don't blame them. I would feel the same if I were them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082010": "Not staying in the safe confines of Gannon but sprinting toward the most dangerous front...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082011": "Nobody would do that unless strongly motivated.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082012": "Or maybe blinded by rage.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082013": "You're so brave...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082014": "I wouldn't call that brave, it was mostly blind rage.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082015": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082016": "Eclipsites killed my parents on the battlefield closest to the Dark Zone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082017": "Back then, the only thing on my mind was to avenge my parents, nothing else.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082018": "Until I finally set foot in battle and realized how tough it is to fight in the Dark Zone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082019": "Yeah, making it back alive from there is nothing to sneeze about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082020": "After losing countless squad mates, I realized it couldn't continue that way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082021": "That was when I switched my goal from killing more Eclipsites to bringing back more intel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27082022": "Because you can never kill all of the Eclipsites, but information can help many people survive their attack.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083001": "Are you there, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083002": "Yes! What can I do for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083003": "I found a book in the Lounge and have no idea who it belonged to.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083004": "No name on the book?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083005": "No owner's name, just the title.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083006": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083007": "It's... \"What, He's the Commander?\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083008": "The subtitle reads, \"The Overbearing Illumina Commander and His Obsession with Eclipsites.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083009": "Novels these days are something else, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083010": "You know, the person on the cover seems familiar...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083011": "Hold it, stop right there!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083012": "Doesn't matter who it looks like, it'll turn into an apocalyptic disaster if found out...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083013": "I agree.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083014": "That's why we must find the owner as soon as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083015": "I have a pretty good idea who this belonged to.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083016": "Anyway, give it to me and I'll return it to the owner.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083017": "Alright.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083018": "Oh, another thing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083019": "Don't worry, I know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27083020": "I'll keep this a secret for the peace in Astra.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27084001": "It's getting dark...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27084002": "Anatoli, you don't like the night, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27084003": "I'm kinda neutral about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27084004": "For me, night is simply night, nothing more.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27084005": "I don't have any special or extra feelings about the night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27084006": "All I do is to observe the night, nothing else.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27084007": "Even an Intelligence Officer needs sleep, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27084008": "You're right, PlayerName. It's about time for a quick nap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27084009": "Goodnight, Anatoli!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27084010": "Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085002": "I've gathered some intriguing intel about you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085003": "You're into painting as well, it seems?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085004": "I love it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085005": "It's okay, I guess...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085006": "But I'm not so skilled in it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085007": "Your paintings fetched a ridiculously high price at the Umbraton auction...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085008": "OHH! It's probably because of those art-dealing brothers...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085009": "Wouldn't you like to see your paintings in an auction?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085010": "I... just hope the paintings they auction are truly created by me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27085011": "And... at least I should get a share of the auction earnings!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101001": "How are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101002": "I'm great!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101003": "The sun is out, today—perfect weather for a stroll, wouldn't you agree?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101004": "Cloudless sunny days are the days I love best.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101005": "Ah, blazing rays of sunlight... They have the power to penetrate the thickest fog and bring clarity to the world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101006": "Sure, I like sunny days too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101007": "Sunny days are the best for playing outside!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101008": "Playing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101009": "It has been so many years since I last played without a care in the world... I can barely remember what it feels like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101010": "It doesn't really feel like anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101011": "Perhaps it's because I like staying at home most of the time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101012": "You're still a carefree young man.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101013": "Is that a bad thing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101014": "No, there's nothing wrong with it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101015": "Life is short, so be sure to make the most of it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27101016": "Suddenly, I don't feel like playing anymore...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102001": "My little daughter's sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102002": "Although she's still very young, I fear that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102003": "She doesn't feel comfortable with the idea of getting too close to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102004": "Sometimes, I feel she's quite afraid of me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102005": "Perhaps it's because you're always so serious...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102006": "Governing a city is a serious occupation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102007": "Carleen also bears the responsibility of bringing glory to Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102008": "There are moments I wish to gently pat her head...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102009": "However, compared to having an affectionate father—",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102010": "Having the City Lord as her father is a lasting honor.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102011": "Perhaps we have different concepts of what it means to be a father.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27102012": "But I don't plan on becoming a father for a long, long time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103001": "Recently, the Eclipsites have repeatedly encroached upon Lumopolis territory.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103002": "There are nobles who remain entrenched in their indulgent, hedonistic ways, oblivious to the danger on the horizon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103003": "In recent days, in order to handle affairs related to Eclipsites...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103004": "I have barely gotten a wink of sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103005": "Peace is not easily achieved through laughter and revelry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103006": "It is earned through battle—through combat and cruelty.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103007": "Are you ready to handle the Eclipsite situation now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103008": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103009": "Our only option is to attack.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103010": "But before that, there are other things I must plan for...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27103011": "Everything I do is for the future of Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104001": "The historic Lumopolis boasts the most magnificent level of civilization and the finest art.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104002": "From the ancient temples and majestic Lumopolis Gardens, to the bustling markets of Lower Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104003": "Every location leaves a unique impression.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104004": "I can really feel your love for Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104005": "You already understand Lumopolis to some extent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104006": "Would you like to learn more?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104007": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104008": "Like what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104009": "To gain a deeper understanding of Lumopolis, one cannot simply experience it through the eyes of the common people.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104010": "One must also turn to classic texts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104011": "I recommend that you visit the library.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104012": "You'll find historical documents about Lumopolis there. After reading them, you'll gain a great deal of insight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104013": "Okay! But, when it comes to reading, I'm not too—",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104014": "Hmm?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27104015": "I mean, I'll definitely go if I get the chance!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141001": "I'm sure you must be aware of my full name, no?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141002": "In Lumopolis, all know it, and all respect it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141003": "I am the City Lord of Lumopolis, Daniel de Schwartz.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141004": "So, how should I address you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141005": "The common people call me His Excellency, the Most Honorable Grand Duke Schwartz.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141006": "You are not from Lumopolis, so there's no need for you to use this title.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141007": "How about I just call you \"sir\"?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141008": "That'll do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141009": "Although this is clearly the first time we've met, there's something strangely familiar about you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141010": "Have we met before?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141011": "(Should I tell him we've met before...?)",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141012": "You don't seem too certain.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141013": "Oh well, it's not important anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27141014": "We can look into this further at some point in the future, should the opportunity present itself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142001": "Do you hear that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142002": "Hear what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142003": "I didn't hear anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142004": "It was the howl of an Eclipsite coming from some distant place.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142005": "Those senseless Eclipsites have gathered into a huge army...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142006": "They've launched an attack on the continent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142007": "Drat! Those Eclipsites!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142008": "I have to...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142009": "I have to drive out every last one of them!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142010": "I understand the pain you have suffered. Ridding this land of Eclipsites is what I too desire most.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142011": "Over numerous past assaults, I have come to know many of their weaknesses.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142012": "Now, in my opinion, they are merely pitiful creatures.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27142013": "Because destruction is their inevitable destiny.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27143001": "Recently, my strength has greatly increased, and I am now able to make use of a wider blast radius.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27143002": "This is the most effective method for eliminating enemies attacking in groups.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27143003": "You've become even stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27143004": "I am the City Lord of Lumopolis. It is only natural that I possess such power.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27143005": "However, strength is only one of the conditions for victory.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27143006": "To win every battle, it is necessary to use tactics wisely.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27143007": "So, are you contemplating what tactics to use?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27143008": "That's right, the formulation of tactics requires the careful consideration of multiple factors.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27143009": "The amassing of troops, the adjustment of manpower, the logistics and consumption of military supplies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27143010": "And now I've just come up with a new idea...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27144001": "Raging winds and crashing waves will sweep through the encroaching storm!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27144002": "Under my command, we will engage in an earth-shaking war with the Eclipsites.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27144003": "You foul creatures shivering in the darkness, just you wait...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27144004": "The sword in my hand trembles with power! The army will obey my every command!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27144005": "The almighty clamor of lightning will be the horn of the battle charge!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27144006": "When our blades strike true, the Eclipsites will crumble!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27144007": "We are sure to achieve victory in the coming war!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27144008": "I believe you will definitely emerge triumphant!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27144009": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27151001": "Daybreak shall cleanse all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27151002": "Wake up, embrace the cleansing touch of the morning sun, and commence your day's work.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27151003": "Good morning! You're up early!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27151004": "Some envy my position, thinking those with power can obtain anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27151005": "However, they're unaware that not everyone can hold onto the throne of power.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27151006": "The responsibilities I bear never cease to nudge me into wakefulness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27151007": "It's not that I want to wake up this early, but I have no other choice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27151008": "You're really working hard...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27152001": "Still enjoying a dream-filled slumber?",

  "str_quest_chat01_27152005": "Even my youngest daughter is aware of the benefits of early morning courtyard exercises.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27152006": "PlayerName, you know what I'm getting at, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27152007": "I-I'm getting up right now!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27161001": "It is midday. Time for a break.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27161002": "What's your drink of choice during your break?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27161003": "Coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27161004": "Yes, coffee is quite invigorating.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27161005": "Speaking of which, I'd say I prefer the coffee my wife brews.",

  "str_quest_chat01_27161009": "Ahem... I also have Fireflies brewing all kinds of drinks for me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27161010": "Oh? How come I sense a touch of envy from you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27161011": "Haha, be it a wife or a daughter, it's a bit too early for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27161012": "It's best for you to focus on what needs to be done right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27161013": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27162001": "Is everything okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27162002": "Not going too well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27162003": "Well, what's your plan to handle it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27162004": "Oh... I haven't come up with one yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27162005": "Waiting is a detrimental habit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27162006": "Instead of wallowing in negativity, you need to take the initiative and conquer it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27162007": "Everything is fine!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27162008": "Haha, good to hear!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27162009": "I appreciate answers full of vigor and vitality like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27162010": "Keep up your good work, PlayerName!",

  "str_quest_chat01_27181005": "When the situation demands it, be the one to strike first, like an arrow shot from the shadow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27181006": "Take enemies out with a decisive strike before they can react.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27181007": "PlayerName, how do you see it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27181008": "That's exactly how I see it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27181009": "Haha, PlayerName, you never disappoint me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27181010": "That's why I always see leadership qualities in you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27181011": "Isn't that a bit far-fetched?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27181012": "Being too naive disqualifies one from leadership.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27181013": "PlayerName, think carefully about the path you want to take.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27181014": "Rest up early.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27182001": "The night is deep, PlayerName. Do you normally dream?",

  "str_quest_chat01_27182003": "Ah, the youth with beautiful dreams—how enviable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27182004": "When I was your age, I, too, tended to dream a lot... dreams, both beautiful and dreadful, of various kinds.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27182005": "But I don't know when it started; my dreams have become less frequent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27182006": "That's why I love watching my daughters' peaceful sleep, especially when they smile in their dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27182007": "That's the happiest moment when I never want anyone to disturb me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27182008": "Your daughters would definitely think they have a loving father if they knew.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27182009": "No, I can't tell them yet. I don't want them to think they can be spoiled.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27182010": "Parenthood... sounds really complicated, doesn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201001": "Have you recovered yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201002": "I'm back to full form!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201003": "This kind of fight isn't a big deal for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201004": "Erm, but I wasn't the one fighting against the Eclipsites...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201005": "No, no... You're more important than that, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201006": "I mean... As long as you've recovered, there's nothing for me to worry about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201007": "I can't seem to get my morale up at all...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201008": "Nothing seems to be working. I think I need to focus more on training.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201009": "How are you doing, Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201010": "I feel much more relaxed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201011": "Great. Are you free right now? I want to show you something.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201012": "Hmm? Now?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201013": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201014": "Well, we've swapped out the old tea sets on the Colossus for a whole new batch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201015": "They're perfect for drinking Knight's Black Tea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201016": "Oh! New tea sets! I'm looking forward to using them!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201017": "Haha! Speaking of which, I've never asked you before...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201018": "Why do you like Knight's Black Tea so much?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201019": "Why do I like it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201020": "Because... Knight's Black Tea evokes a very special memory in my mind...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201021": "A beautiful memory.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201022": "Even though many people find the taste to be bitter, for me, this tea is as sweet as the memory it conjures up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201023": "A beautiful memory...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201024": "Uh, sorry! I've said too much...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201025": "Goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27201026": "Um... I mean, I'll see you later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202001": "The weather's really nice. I want to go out for a walk.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202002": "Where do you wanna go, Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202003": "I haven't decided yet. Umbraton, a forest, or perhaps somewhere quiet...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202004": "Somewhere quiet... How about Cloud Gardens?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202005": "No, not there...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202006": "Never mind, please forget what I just said.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202007": "... Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202008": "Well, perhaps Umbraton? A new drinks shop has just opened.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202009": "Oh? What kind of drinks shop?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202010": "Well, they have lots of different kinds of tea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202011": "Aurorian breakfast, orange tea, earl grey...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202012": "It sounds more like a tea house...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202013": "Yes! I love tea houses!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202014": "Interested, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202015": "Um... If they do desserts, then of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202016": "Oh, really...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27202017": "I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203001": "Um, sorry to interrupt...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203002": "What's the matter, Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203003": "I'd like... to ask you for help choosing a gift for a friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203004": "Sure thing! What kind of stuff does your friend like?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203005": "Um... this friend likes to be in the thick of any exciting, lively scene, and travels frequently. He has so many friends!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203006": "Really? He sounds like the complete opposite of you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203007": "Well, actually... when I'm with him, I feel very relaxed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203008": "Do you have any ideas?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203009": "This friend... it's not me, is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203010": "N-No! Please don't joke around like that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203011": "Right, let me think...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203012": "Send him a potted plant.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203013": "A potted plant?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203014": "It sounds like a good gift.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203015": "But knowing him, he wouldn't have time to take care of it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203016": "How about a wicker flower basket?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203017": "Oh! That might do the trick!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203018": "I actually just saw some in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203019": "Give him some black tea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203020": "Black tea?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203021": "I think he actually prefers desserts...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203022": "Well, that I can help you with! I know a great cake shop in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203023": "How about I come along with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203024": "Huh? There's really no need... I wouldn't want to cause you any bother.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203025": "Going to a cake shop? It wouldn't be even the slightest bit of bother!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203026": "I'd be very happy to help.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203027": "Well, I suppose I'd better prepare...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203028": "Huh? What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27203029": "N-Nothing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204001": "I... I want to thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204002": "Thank me? What's this all about...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204003": "Yes, thank you! Regarding my identity... I have thought long and hard about what you said...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204004": "You said to me, \"Family, honor... these are things other people have imposed on you.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204005": "\"I know you'll find a purpose all your own—a purpose to fight for.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204006": "You still remember all that...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204007": "Yes! Actually, I've already found my purpose, but I didn't say it aloud...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204008": "Whenever I see you putting yourself in danger to protect everyone, my body always trembles uncontrollably...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204009": "I think... that this is my impulse to selflessly protect someone else...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204010": "Impulse... This is a word my father highly frowns upon, but now I can say it with ease...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204011": "Mia...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204012": "Well, I know that compared to everyone else, I still have a lot of shortcomings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204013": "But please... please believe in me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204014": "I promise to protect you... and everyone else!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27204015": "Great! Mia, I should be the one thanking you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205001": "Erm... Do you have any free time today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205002": "Sure. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205003": "W-Well, I'd like to know if you'll go to Umbraton with me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205004": "You're actually inviting me to go out with you?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205005": "Was that too direct...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205006": "No! I'd be happy to go with you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205007": "I'm just worried that you've only just recovered, so it might not be the best idea for you to go out just yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205008": "Thank you for your concern, but it's okay. I'm already much better now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205009": "Great! In that case, I'll come find you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205010": "Great...! Let's meet on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205011": "Please feel free to meet me whenever you're ready.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27205999": "Go find Mia, quickly!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241001": "Thank you for the invitation. I hope I'm not intruding...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241002": "There's always room for one more here. The more, the merrier!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241003": "Well, that certainly seems to be the case...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241004": "Everyone gets along just fine here! It's like a non-stop party!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241005": "I can see that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241006": "Uh, is something wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241007": "N-No, it's just that I prefer being alone to being plunged into such a lively environment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241008": "Oh! But you don't have to give me any special treatment, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241009": "It's just that... I'm not too used to it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241010": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241011": "Sorry, I just got a little carried away and didn't consider how you might be feeling.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241012": "N-No, it's my fault...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241013": "Um... There's a rec room on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241014": "It's perfect for enjoying some quality recreation time on your own.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241015": "Plus, I know you're gonna love the tea table in there!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241016": "Interested in taking a look?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241017": "Oh? You have a place like that here? That sounds great!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27241018": "Thank you! I'm looking forward to it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242001": "Is this an illusion...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242002": "What's the matter, Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242003": "I've recently had this feeling, like some force is constantly surging up within me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242004": "Is it your friend, Baba Yaga?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242005": "No... Baba Yaga is a lot less subtle than this...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242006": "Although I haven't fully mastered this new power yet, combat seems to be a lot less strenuous for me now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242007": "You've become stronger, Mia!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242008": "H-Have I really become stronger?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242009": "Yeah! And you'll get even stronger in the future!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242010": "Thank you... I still need more training.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242011": "How about I train with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242012": "Oh?! Is that okay with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242013": "Where... Where's a good place to train?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242014": "I really can't think of anywhere...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242015": "Wait for me to ask Vice and Carleen first.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242016": "Vice and Carleen... won't get annoyed if we bother them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242017": "No way! They're always looking for new partners to train with!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27242018": "A-Alright.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243001": "If I could work on my control, I would definitely, definitely...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243002": "Are you training, Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243003": "Um, yes, PlayerName... I'm sorry, I accidentally sent that to you just now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243004": "I was actually thinking of you just now. I wanted to let you know that I sense you're getting stronger all the time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243005": "I-I'm really working on it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243006": "When it comes to something like getting stronger, you really shouldn't make fun of me, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243007": "Really, the last time we trained together, remember I said:",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243008": "\"Mia, you launch your Lumina so quickly!\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243009": "Do you remember?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243010": "I remember... but PlayerName, don't you always try to encourage me like that, whether I'm getting stronger or not?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243011": "Erm... do I?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243012": "Yes! So... do you really feel I'm getting stronger?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243013": "Of course. I'm a Caelestite, I can sense these things.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243014": "I can always sense how hard you're working!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27243015": "Um... then I'll keep working hard!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244001": "Where would be the best place to go today...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244002": "Oh? Aren't you training today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244003": "Well, my Luminatics have been improving a lot faster than I anticipated!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244004": "So today I've decided to relax and go shopping, and maybe drink some tea...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244005": "Oh, you must really be pushing yourself with this training, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244006": "Yes... It did take some time to get the knack of it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244007": "But as for confronting Eclipsites head-on... I'm still not quite there yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244008": "Just thinking about them still makes me feel a little afraid...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244009": "But if I recall correctly, whenever Eclipsites show up, you're always the first to charge forward.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244010": "At your current level of strength, the Eclipsites should be the ones afraid of you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244011": "Oh? Am I really so scary?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244012": "Ah! I mean, you're powerful enough to deter any enemy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244013": "I hope so...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244014": "If the Eclipsites try threatening you or anyone else here, I won't hesitate for even a moment to strike them down!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244015": "Mia... Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27244016": "I won't let any harm come to you either.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27251001": "Good day, Navigator. Got any plans for today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27251002": "No, nothing on my schedule.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27251003": "Well, that means you can savor a relaxing morning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27251004": "Want a steaming cup of Knight's Black Tea?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27251005": "There's a lot of work on Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27251006": "I see... Would you like a cup of Knight's Black Tea then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27251007": "You know, a nice cup of tea can keep you going all day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27251008": "I left the tea in the fridge. Help yourself if you want some.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27252001": "PlayerName, you can't see me when we're communicating through the terminal, can you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27252002": "That's right. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27252003": "If that's the case, I'm a bit concerned.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27252004": "Baba Yaga doesn't show up as often anymore...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27252005": "However, if she appears and starts sending disturbing messages...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27252006": "It's okay. I can tell the difference.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27252007": "I'm reassured hearing you say that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27252008": "You'll be fine, Mia.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27252009": "Let's hope so...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27252010": "Anyway, if I ever send any odd messages, please don't take them too seriously.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261001": "I noticed some of the unique vegetables from Lumopolis at lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261002": "My memory is a bit fuzzy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261003": "But I think Carleen used to really hate eating those...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261004": "So, did you eat them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261005": "Of course, I'm the older sister.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261006": "If I'm as picky as Carleen, how could I possibly set a good example?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261007": "Why do you suddenly start reminiscing? Are you feeling homesick?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261008": "It would be a lie to say I don't...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261009": "I really wish the whole family could gather around the dinning table again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261010": "I'm sure the day will come.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261011": "Yes, we're family connected by blood after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27261012": "Even with the distance between us, this won't change... I'll patiently await their return.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262001": "I haven't even had lunch yet, but why do I feel so full?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262002": "Could it be...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262003": "Could it be what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262004": "I'm thinking, maybe Baba Yaga was out again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262005": "And she had lunch for me while I was unaware.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262006": "Don't worry. If it was really her, the Colossus' security systems would have reacted.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262007": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262008": "If it was really her, she'd definitely create a bigger mess.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262009": "You made a good point...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262010": "Looks like I was worrying for nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27262011": "Maybe I'm simply not in the mood to eat today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27281001": "Before going to sleep, I had a sudden flash of memories from way back.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27281002": "Memories?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27281003": "Yes... But I'm not sure if it's real.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27281004": "It was in Lumopolis... my bed was quite big.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27281005": "Carleen would sometimes get scared at night and insisted on sleeping with me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27281006": "Didn't think Carleen would have that side as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27281007": "I know, right? Though she'll never admit it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27281008": "As her older sister, it doesn't seem quite right to keep bringing up her embarrassing past.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27281009": "So, keep what I just mentioned between us, alright?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282001": "I'd love to have another cup of Knight's Black Tea before bed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282002": "But I heard drinking tea before bedtime can make it hard to sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282003": "That's true.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282004": "Oh, if only tea didn't have that refreshing effect...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282005": "Maybe I could use a bit less tea? Brew a milder tea?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282006": "This way, it shouldn't mess up my sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282007": "Just go ahead if you really want to drink it that bad.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282008": "Well, since you put it that way...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282009": "I'll go boil some water now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282010": "As it turns out, when you really want to do something, it's best to do it right away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27282011": "Overthinking gets you nowhere.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301001": "I saw you in the lounge just now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301002": "It looks like you could do with a little pepping up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301003": "I was just trying to take a break.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301004": "Right, and I didn't want to say anything because I was worried about disturbing you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301005": "Thanks, that was considerate of you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301006": "It looked like your pants were a bit dusty, so I guessed you must have walked a fair bit today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301007": "Yeah, I just got back from the Rediesel Desert.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301008": "So, I asked Whisper to go over and massage your legs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301009": "Huh? How come I didn't feel anything?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301010": "Well, your legs were just too dirty, so it just bit the hem around your ankles instead.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27301011": "What?! There really are a couple of little tooth marks on my pants...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302001": "I haven't seen you around recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302002": "Yeah, I've been a bit busy lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302003": "Even if you're busy, don't forget to get a good rest every day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302004": "Don't worry, I will.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302005": "So, let's go out and play today!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302006": "Oh, maybe not today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302007": "Um... but there are so many places I wanna go and play with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302008": "You don't need to wait for me, you can go out by yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302009": "No, it's still more fun playing with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302010": "Just wait a while and I'll join you when I finish my work.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27302011": "Alright, you've got yourself a deal! I'll be waiting for you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27303001": "I made some new clothes for you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27303002": "Huh? Clothes?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27303003": "Uh-huh. I don't know whether they'll fit or not.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27303004": "I'll give them to you later and you can give them a try.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27303005": "What are you doing making clothes for me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27303006": "I was making clothes for Whisper, so I thought I'd make something for you too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27303007": "So, Whisper and I...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27303008": "That's right, I made you matching outfits!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27303009": "Wear it and I guarantee Whisper's gonna stick to you like glue!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27303010": "Is it okay if I don't wear it...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27304001": "We've got an emergency here! There's someone in the middle of the desert and they need help!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27304002": "Huh? Are you sure it's an emergency? What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27304003": "Less questions, more action—let's go to the Rediesel Desert!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27304004": "I'm waiting for you on the bridge!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27304999": "We're heading to the Rediesel Desert with Jakine to see if anyone there really needs help.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27341001": "My divinations have been super accurate recently!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27341002": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27341003": "Really! I helped Vice find her hairpin yesterday...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27341004": "I helped a chef find his spatula the day before yesterday...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27341005": "And the day before that, I predicted it would rain!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27341006": "That's really impressive. Can you do a divination for me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27341007": "Of course, what do you wanna know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27341008": "Where's the one million Nightium I lost?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27341009": "My divination is telling me you've never had a million Nightium in your entire life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27341010": "Well, you can't blame me for trying...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27351001": "That's strange... There weren't many people at the restaurant for breakfast just now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27351002": "Maybe everyone's busy these days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27351003": "*sigh* The Colossus feels so cold and empty.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27351004": "It's not that cold, I'm still here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27351005": "Let's call everyone together and have some fun!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27351006": "Alright.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27351007": "Yeah, we can have a party and play games together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27351008": "Don't disturb everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27351009": "Well, alright, I guess we should take care of business first.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352001": "You still haven't woken up yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352002": "I'm up, I'm up... I just saw your message from last night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352003": "Sorry for not replying, I was already asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352004": "It's okay, I just noticed how beautiful the stars were and thought I'd send you a message.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352005": "Yeah, you get to see a lot of beautiful night skies on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352006": "You're so lucky. I really wish I could live here forever.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352007": "That depends on your performance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352008": "Well, I'm gonna do some divining for you every day—that way I can make sure every day is a lucky day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352009": "There's a difference between divining and just wishing someone good luck...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352010": "Of course you can.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352011": "You can stay for as long as you want.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27352012": "Wow! That's awesome! I'm so happy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27353001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27353002": "Is there anywhere fun nearby?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27353003": "What did you have in mind?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27353004": "I wanna go to the park!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27353005": "All those beautiful flowers and fun rides...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27353006": "And stories—there should be people telling stories there. That would be amazing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27353007": "I think I know of a place like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27353008": "Really? Can you take me there?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27353009": "Okay, let's go after breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27353010": "Yay! It's a date! Don't go back on your word now, you hear?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27354001": "Get up!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27354002": "What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27354003": "My divination shows you need to wake up early today!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27354004": "I'm already up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27354005": "Good! That's fine, just fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27354006": "What would happen if I didn't get up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27354007": "If you didn't get up, something terrible would happen!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27354008": "You might fall back asleep!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355001": "I just woke up and did some divination. And it seems someone around me is in for a lucky day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355002": "Who could it be?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355003": "You're quite slow, aren't you? It's obviously you, considering I went out of my way to come tell you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355004": "Wow, I really didn't see that coming!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355005": "Come on, you don't look surprised at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355006": "Thanks for letting me know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355007": "Heehee, don't thank me; it's your good fortune you should appreciate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355008": "You should put on clothes in your lucky color later, and don't forget to carry the lucky charm I made...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355009": "What's the point of all that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355010": "Well, you see... I'm just a bit worried my divination might be off.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27355011": "Doing all this should boost the odds for you to have a lucky day, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356002": "Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356003": "Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356004": "???",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356005": "Oops, my bad, I hit send one too many times.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356006": "I'm still getting the hang of this Colossus terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356007": "Just be careful not to mess it up, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356008": "No worries. I've done a divination for it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356009": "The probability of this thing breaking in my hands is only 3%!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356010": "You're not great with high-tech stuff, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356011": "Well, it's not like I'm bad at it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356012": "The thing is, we don't see such stuff often in Northland.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356013": "Don't worry; after a few more tries, I'll get the hang of it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27356014": "I'll get the hang of it. I'll get the hang of it. I'll get the hang of it. I'll get the hang of it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27361001": "Another successful divination!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27361002": "This time I did something super amazing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27361003": "What did you do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27361004": "I helped a lost kitten find its owner!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27361005": "Haha, that's really impressive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27361006": "Heh, and the owner even treated me to lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27361007": "That's great. Hey, I should come along with you next time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27361008": "Sniffing around for a free lunch, eh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27361009": "N-No, I just want to do a good deed, too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27362001": "Wow, look what I found!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27362002": "A book about raising pet snakes!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27362003": "You found it on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27362004": "Yeah, you've never seen it before?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27362005": "I've never really paid much attention to books like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27362006": "There's so much useful info in this thing! Can I take it back with me to give it a proper read through?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27362007": "Sure. I don't think there's anyone else around here who's gonna miss a book like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27363001": "Hmm, what a boring afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27363002": "Why don't we give Whisper a bath together!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27363003": "Huh? You want me to help give your pet snake a bath?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27363004": "Yeah! It's a nice warm afternoon—we'll lay him down in a wooden tub and give him a warm bath.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27363005": "That sounds so relaxing, I wanna take a bath too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27363006": "Hey! You can take a bath with Whisper!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27363007": "Oh, well... I just remembered, I took a bath this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27364001": "Good afternoon! This place is poppin'!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27364002": "I'm loving it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27364003": "What are you so happy about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27364004": "I just made a bunch of new friends at the cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27364005": "I get the feeling you really enjoy making friends.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27364006": "You betcha.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27364007": "Only by making more friends...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27364008": "...can we ensure that we always have the help we need to survive in even the harshest environments.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27364009": "Hah, that sounds like ancient Northland wisdom right there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27364010": "You sure are smart! You hit the nail right on the head!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27365001": "Uh-oh, have you seen my Whisper?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27365002": "I accidentally let it out while I was having lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27365003": "It vanished in the blink of an eye.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27365004": "Yikes, we better find it fast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27365005": "Absolutely! Folks aboard are from all corners of the world...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27365006": "I've heard that in certain places, they have a thing for snake meat, and it's mealtime now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27365007": "You're being exaggerating, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27365008": "Actually, I'm more concerned it might scare others...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27365009": "Boo-hoo, I'm seriously worried! We must find Whisper quickly!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27365010": "Oh, right, divination! We need to divine quickly where Whisper is!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366001": "Excuse me, have you seen my bag?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366002": "Nope, is there anything important in it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366003": "Not particularly important, just materials for divination...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366004": "I'm really too careless...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366005": "You need materials for your divination?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366006": "You know, my mom's divination book includes quite a few unique divination methods.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366007": "Being a disciple of Jeriah, I have to experiment with various things as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366008": "The thing is, the materials inside have a quite strong smell...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366009": "What exactly are you using for divination?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366010": "Well, divination involves all sorts of unusual things, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27366011": "Let's hope to find my bag before things get worse...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27381001": "The moon tonight... It's the ideal moment for that ritual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27381002": "Sounds really suspicious.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27381003": "Not suspicious at all; this divination ritual is renowned for its 100% accuracy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27381004": "Ritual?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27381005": "That's right! In my mom's divination book, this ritual boasts 100% accuracy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27381006": "But there might be a slight risk involved.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27381007": "What kind of risk are we talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27381008": "Like, if it's not done correctly, you might get haunted by ghosts or something.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27381009": "But as long as I'm careful, my divination's accuracy is already quite high.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27381010": "So there's really no need for this kind of ritual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27382001": "I'm really sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27382002": "Go to sleep then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27382003": "I can't, I'm still stargazing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27382004": "Gorgeous though the starry sky is, stargazing can be pretty tiring.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27382005": "I wonder if my mom is looking at the same starry sky as I am.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27382006": "Maybe due to the time difference, it's still daytime where she is.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27382007": "You sure know how to ruin the mood... But I do miss her a lot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27382008": "I'm sure she is.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27382009": "Hmm. It's been a while since I last saw her, especially since Mom went into meditation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27382010": "Maybe I should do a divination to see when I'll get to see Mom again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27401001": "I saw the sweetest little girl on the street today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27401002": "She looked so cute, holding her mother's hand and laughing with those chubby, rosy cheeks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27401003": "Seeing little children laughing and having fun always fills my heart with joy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27401004": "You must really like kids!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27401005": "Even though they can be really loud and annoying sometimes... I can't say they're not cute!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27401006": "Their hands and feet are so small and soft, and they're all so delicate and precious...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27401007": "I truly believe that every child in the world is sweet at heart.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27401008": "Some just need the right guidance to make them understand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27401009": "Children are as pure as snow, and they represent our hope in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27401010": "Wow... What a beautiful sentiment!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27402001": "Pardon me, PlayerName? Aside from Lumopolis...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27402002": "Do you know of any other place where I can buy premium-quality black tea?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27402003": "Sitting here in the warm sunshine suddenly made me recall its delightful taste.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27402004": "Actually, there's this tiny, hidden shop in Umbraton that only serves regulars most of the time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27402005": "It usually carries a lot of interesting and high-quality goods like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27402006": "Want me to ask if they have any tea for sale?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27402007": "No, that's quite alright. I can go look for it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27402008": "Hmm, it seems this may cost quite a bit of Nightium.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27402009": "I'll have to plan this out carefully.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403001": "I've made my decision.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403002": "On what, may I ask?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403003": "I've decided to look for short-term work during my journey.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403004": "I could teach art, history, or even swordsmanship!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403005": "After all, I should learn how to survive on my own, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403006": "It could help with alleviating the financial burdens of extended travel as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403007": "Nightium reigns supreme, no matter where we go in the world...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403008": "Yeah, you're totally right!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403009": "Trust me, not having any money is a real bummer...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403010": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403011": "Then I'll start looking for work right away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403012": "Wish me luck!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27403013": "I'll be rooting for you, Joshua!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404001": "I passed by a shop earlier today, and saw this beautiful clock hanging on the wall.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404002": "I've never seen anything like it. That clock must be quite special.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404003": "It was such a masterful assortment of countless parts that fit seamlessly together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404004": "And when those parts were set in motion, it told the time with perfect accuracy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404005": "I've always been fond of unconventional innovations like this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404006": "Wow, sounds like a really interesting clock!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404007": "So did you end up buying it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404008": "Nope!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404009": "As wonderful as that clock may be, it's not exactly portable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404010": "The reason I like it so much...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404011": "... is because its excellent craftsmanship is a testament to the time and attention given to it by its creator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404012": "In other words, it's a labor of love, and a beautiful one at that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27404013": "It makes a lot of sense when you put it that way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27405001": "Can you do me a favor, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27405002": "I've purchased a bunch of goods, and it's a bit overwhelming. Can you help me transport them to Northland?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27405003": "Rest assured. I'll pay you well, my friend. I won't let you make the trip in vain.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27405004": "No problem at all! But seriously, talking about payment among pals? Don't be all proper and stuff.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27405005": "Heheh! It's because we're friends that I value our bond.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27405006": "We can talk about the specifics in person. I'll be waiting for you on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27405999": "Joshua is expecting you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441001": "Hi!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441002": "Oh, but where are my manners? Allow me to introduce myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441003": "My name is Joshua, and I'm currently on a personal journey of sorts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441004": "Wait, that name sounds awfully familiar...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441005": "Shhhh—",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441006": "Please don't call me Lady Joshua anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441007": "As far as the world is concerned, the city lord's wife passed away many years ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441008": "As for me... I'm nothing more than a woman who bears a striking resemblance to her!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441009": "Now let's just leave the past behind us, shall we?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441010": "I understand. Don't worry, I promise to keep your real identity a secret.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441011": "Good boy! I knew you would understand!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27441012": "Now then, I have much to prepare for the next part of my journey...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27442001": "A sword changes in accordance with its wielder's resolve.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27442002": "When a person's will falters and grows weak—",
  "str_quest_chat01_27442003": "Their blade loses its luster.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27442004": "Conversely, when a person faces a battle with courage and determination—",
  "str_quest_chat01_27442005": "Even the most ordinary of blades will surge with explosive might.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27442006": "I wish to become a fearless and courageous person such as this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27442007": "As I forge ahead on my journey, I'm certain my blade will respond to my willpower.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27442008": "I know you can do it, Joshua!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27442009": "There is still so much left for me to accomplish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27442010": "I owe much of my progress to you and your encouragement.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443001": "Through arduous training, I've managed to reclaim some of my former sword skills.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443002": "Really? I'd love to see them sometime, Joshua!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443003": "Heheheh, I should have no problem dealing with stronger enemies now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443004": "Are you interested in rapiers at all, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443005": "I am!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443006": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443007": "I just don't know how to use one very well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443008": "Since they normally lack any slashing capabilities, rapiers are only used for thrusting attacks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443009": "Their strength lies in their lightness and speed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443010": "Even a woman such as myself can wield them to devastating effect with the proper technique.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443011": "I see! If that's the case, then maybe I could learn how to use one too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443012": "You very well could!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27443013": "I'll be sure to try it out when I have the chance!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444001": "My wish, from long ago until now, has always been to protect everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444002": "But I know all too well—",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444003": "That protecting others is never as simple as it sounds.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444004": "Danger lurks in every corner of the world, unseen and unpredictable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444005": "I will earn the right to face the unknown only by becoming stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444006": "I agree!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444007": "I have to get stronger if I want to protect Eraveil...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444008": "As well as all of the friends I've made in life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444009": "What a kind and courageous child you are!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444010": "No matter the circumstances, we must seize every opportunity to move forward.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444011": "From this day forth, I will devote all of my power to the pursuit of my dream.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27444012": "I pray that you will do the same, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27451001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27451002": "Doing some light stretches in the morning will help you shake off your drowsiness!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27451003": "Good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27451004": "It seems you're still not fully awake, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27451005": "Sorry, I've just been pretty tired lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27451006": "There's nothing wrong with sleeping a while longer if you're feeling exhausted, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27452001": "The sun is shining, little one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27452002": "Have you gotten out of bed yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27452003": "I'm up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27452004": "It's really nice of you to wake me up in the morning, Lady Joshua.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27452005": "This must be... What it feels like to have a mother!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27452006": "I'm happy to do it, my child. If you ever find yourself missing your mother, feel free to call on me for a chat.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27453001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27453002": "Have you eaten breakfast yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27453003": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27453004": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27453005": "A good day starts with a good breakfast. Remember that, my child.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27453006": "Your health should always come first.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27453007": "So don't let your work get in the way of having a decent breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27453008": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454001": "You know what? When you wake up, you should look in the mirror and give yourself a smile.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454002": "And your luck for the day is going to be fantastic.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454003": "Really? Does it actually work?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454004": "Of course, smiling is a way to share the happiness you experience with others.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454005": "Those open to sharing their happiness with others tend to have good luck.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454006": "So, remember to smile more, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454007": "Got it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454008": "You're a great kid, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454009": "But sometimes, when I think about the day's work, it's really hard to smile.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454010": "You're right; there are times like that, but that's when a smile becomes even more necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454011": "When you tackle problems with a smile, they become much more manageable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27454012": "Okay, I've got other things to take care of. Have a great day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455001": "Hmm, it's quite a head-scratcher... There's something I'd like to discuss with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455002": "What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455003": "Lately, I've been watching some cooking shows.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455004": "It made me think about the times I used to cook, and I'm getting the itch to try it again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455005": "So, I thought about making some snacks for the kids on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455006": "But it's been a long time since I last cooked, and I'm not sure about my current culinary skills...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455007": "So, how can I help you with that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455008": "Could you taste them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455009": "You want me to try them out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455010": "You truly are an understanding kid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455011": "Sure thing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455012": "Then I'll have Fireflies bring some over to your place later, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455013": "Well, um... I've tasted them, and they seemed okay, but I think I might have mixed up sugar, salt, and flavor enhancers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27455014": "So, the flavor might be a bit unconventional. Please get ready for a surprise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27461001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27461002": "Do you have any plans for the afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27461003": "Just taking a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27461004": "I haven't been getting enough sleep lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27461005": "Just going for a stroll.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27461006": "I've been taking lots of walks lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27461007": "I see. It seems you already have plans of your own then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27461008": "I wanted to show you my newest potted plants, but we'll just have to wait until next time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27461009": "Sure thing! I'll drop by when I have some free time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27462001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27462002": "Good afternoon, Lady Joshua.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27462003": "You can just call me Joshua.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27462004": "Sorry, I'm just not used to calling my elders by their names like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27462005": "Very well then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27462006": "Goodness, what am I to do with you, child?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27463001": "Remember to have a nice, filling lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27463002": "Otherwise, you won't have enough energy to tackle the day properly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27463003": "I know, but my cooking isn't exactly delicious...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27463004": "That reminds me, it's been quite some time since I've tried my hand in the kitchen.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27463005": "Years, if I'm not mistaken...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27463006": "I think it's time for us to learn some new recipes, don't you? Let's both do our best!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27464001": "Later in the afternoon, I'd like to play some music inside the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27464002": "How does that sound to you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27464003": "What kind of music are you planning to play?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27464004": "A light and lively tune is perfect for a relaxed post-meal atmosphere.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27464005": "Sure, that sounds good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27464006": "It's wonderful you're on board with the idea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27464007": "How do you feel about some light music?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27464008": "That sounds good, I like light music.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27464009": "Heheh, I'll go pick out some tracks then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465001": "It's really bugging me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465002": "Have you encountered some trouble?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465003": "It's not quite a trouble, really...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465004": "Just now, that girl with the lizard tail handed me a snack.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465005": "I believe it's called \"Fried Rediesel Worms.\" It looks pretty greasy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465006": "If it doesn't look appetizing, you can skip it, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465007": "The snack itself isn't the issue...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465008": "Um... who knows, it might turn out to be unexpectedly tasty?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465009": "The taste doesn't concern me; I've had even weirder things back in Lower Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465010": "But it seems she's given this to many of the kids on the Colossus, which is quite a headache.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465011": "If they eat it now, they won't have an appetite for a proper meal later, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27465012": "Turns out that's what bothers you, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27481001": "Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27481002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27481003": "I'm about to go to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27481004": "An early bedtime means you'll have more energy for the next day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27481005": "I'm not sure if the years are starting to take their toll, but I've been feeling more tired lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27481006": "Huh? What are you talking about, you look so young!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27481007": "Heheh, then it seems I'll have to live up to my looks and find more things to do!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27482001": "It's getting late!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27482002": "Are you still busy, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27482003": "No, just zoning out...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27482004": "You must be tired after all of your work today, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27482005": "Perhaps some soft music will help you fall asleep sooner?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27482006": "Good idea!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27483001": "It's getting late!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27483002": "Before the night ends, I like to plan out my activities for the following day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27483003": "Having clear goals helps to motivate me in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27483004": "Tell me, do you have any plans for tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27483005": "I do!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27483006": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27483007": "I see. In any case, I look forward to the coming day, and so should you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484001": "Good evening, Navigator. I noticed your room's light is still on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484002": "You're not in bed yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484003": "I'm having a bit of trouble falling asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484004": "Quite a coincidence; I'm also finding it hard to fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484005": "Are you having insomnia too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484006": "Well... sort of, I guess. Maybe doing something else will help me fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484007": "How about I share a bedtime story with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484008": "Who knows, it might help lull you to sleep as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484009": "Forget it; I'm too old for this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484010": "I see. Indeed, you've outgrown the age that needs bedtime stories.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484011": "I've already grown out of that age.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484012": "Haha, my daughters used to say the same to me back in the day. Your words bring back fond memories.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27484013": "Well, I won't disturb you further. Get some rest soon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485001": "Navigator, would you like a cup of honey water before bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485002": "I've prepared a full bottle for the children on the Colossus, and there's plenty to spare.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485003": "Is drinking something so sweet before bed a good idea?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485004": "Yes, drinking honey water before bedtime can actually help with sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485005": "Isn't that just a rumor?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485006": "Just like drinking warm milk before bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485007": "How can it be a rumor? It's advice from experts in Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485008": "I too find it pretty effective.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485009": "Okay, sure...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485010": "Anyway, I've left the honey water in the dining area.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27485011": "Help yourself if you want some.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501001": "Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501003": "Do you need me to arrange a meal for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501004": "That's okay, I'll just grab a bite to eat later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501005": "On the topic of food...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501006": "Tell me, do you prefer eating at newly-opened restaurants or long-established ones?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501007": "New ones!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501008": "I see. Newer eateries tend to have tidier spaces and more creative dishes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501009": "In that case, I'll have one of the new restaurants in the area deliver a meal for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501010": "Old ones!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501011": "I see. Older eateries often have unique dishes and reputations that have overcome the test of time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501012": "In that case, I'll have one of the older restaurants in the area deliver a meal for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501013": "You know, having you plan out my meals for me, I can't help but feel a little embarrassed, hahaha!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501014": "Understood. I'll just let you feed yourself then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501015": "H-Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27501016": "Heheh, only joking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502001": "The Colossus flies so high above the world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502002": "Do you ever get bored of seeing the sky all the time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502003": "Sometimes, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502004": "Not at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502005": "Lumopolis at night is just as scenic and enjoyable as it is during the day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502006": "One of my personal favorites is a bakery that sells the most delicious chocolate cake in all of Astra.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502007": "Would you care to go there someday?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502008": "Heck yeah, I would!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502009": "Heheh, it seems you're still a growing, young Caelestite after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502010": "I'll be sure to take you there when the next opportunity arises.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502011": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502012": "Pardon me, but is that drool I see in the corner of your mouth?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27502013": "What?! Crap, I thought I wiped it off...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503001": "You seem a bit tired lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503002": "Yeah, it's been so busy these days that I haven't been sleeping very well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503003": "Maybe the stress is keeping you from getting a good night's rest?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503004": "A lack of sleep will only add to your stress and exhaustion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503005": "I'll go look for a way to help you sleep at night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503006": "It's okay, really! I'm sure I'll be fine after a while, don't worry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503007": "I wouldn't be much of an assistant if I just took your words at face value, would I?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503008": "To be honest, I have a few relaxation techniques that might prove useful to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503009": "Whenever I'm feeling stressed, whether it's from work or personal matters, the first thing I do...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503010": "Is pour myself a cup of rose-infused tea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503011": "The combination of fresh rose petals and high-quality black tea is one of life's most fantastic pairings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503012": "A single sip is all it takes to calm me down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503013": "That actually sounds really nice right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503014": "It's also the secret behind my highly-efficient work performance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503015": "I'll bring you a cup in a few minutes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27503016": "Really? Thanks a bunch!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504001": "The sky is beautiful tonight. The stars are shining with friendly warmth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504002": "I bet! Where are you stargazing right now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504003": "In the Lounge. It's rather peaceful when no one else is in here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504004": "Really? I smelled something nice when I passed the Lounge a few minutes ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504005": "But I didn't see anyone inside, so I thought I was imagining things.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504006": "I didn't know it was you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504007": "Did you like it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504008": "Like what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504009": "That smell.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504010": "I just bought a new perfume recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504011": "Its delightfully-mysterious scent is best appreciated at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504012": "When I wear it, I feel as though I'm standing in the soft light of the moon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504013": "It sounds like you're writing an ad for it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504014": "I suppose, but that wasn't exactly the response I was looking for.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504015": "O-Oh, sorry about that! How should I put it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504016": "Well, it smells great! I just can't really think of a better way to describe it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27504017": "Perhaps you'd like to try it on, and bask in the moonlight yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541001": "Hello, my name is Blanc. I work as a guide in Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541002": "A guide?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541003": "Correct. My duties are not entirely different from those of a tour guide.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541004": "However, I prefer to think of myself as a guardian of Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541005": "Then it's nice to meet you, Guardian of Lumopolis!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541006": "Heheheh, you're the first person to ever address me like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541007": "Thank you for your earnest support of my profession.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541008": "Don't mention it, but do you always have to be so formal?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541009": "Would you prefer if I spoke in a more casual manner?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541010": "Very well. I'll do my best to accommodate your preferences.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541011": "But just so you know, I choose to speak so formally to prevent anyone from misunderstanding my words.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541012": "I see. Then as your friend, I should be more understanding of your choices. Feel free to talk to me however you see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541013": "I'm both delighted and surprised by your answer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27541014": "And I'm not just being formal by saying so.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542001": "I hear you tasted some of Lumopolis' special cuisine recently?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542002": "That's right! I tried this dish a while ago, and it was pretty tasty!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542003": "Would you like to know how that dish came to be?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542004": "Uh, sure? A little history lesson wouldn't hurt, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542005": "When it comes to the history of Lumopolis, we must start from ancient times in order to...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542006": "Sorry, but could I interrupt you for just a second?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542007": "Are you saying that this dish dates all the way back to ancient Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542008": "Not at all. In fact, this dish was first invented roughly twenty years ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542009": "Then why are we talking about ancient Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542010": "Because my memorization skills have been surprisingly sharp lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542011": "I managed to memorize the entirety of the Annals of Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542012": "Not an easy feat, considering it's composed of two separate volumes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542013": "My mind is practically overflowing with knowledge, so I wanted to share some of it with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542014": "Now let me tell you all about the historical events leading up to the discovery of this wonderful dish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542015": "Uh, I have a better idea...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27542016": "Why don't we save this history lesson for another time? Like when I'm suffering from insomnia?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543001": "I didn't think I could get this much stronger at my age.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543002": "Aw, age is just a number! Besides, you look super young!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543003": "Hmph. Flattery will get you nowhere, but thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543004": "Did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543005": "My improved power has helped me discover a number of hidden locations in Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543006": "Like secret tunnels, or the city lord's hidden chamber?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543007": "No, those wouldn't be permitted to visit during a tour of Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543008": "Then what kind of hidden locations?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543009": "Naturally, I'm talking about scenic locations that don't receive a lot of attention.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543010": "Oh! I'd love to see them for myself someday then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543011": "And I would be happy to show them to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27543012": "Though if you prefer, I could show you some even more hidden places in the city...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544001": "Oh dear, this isn't good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544002": "Having some trouble, Ms. Blanc? I hardly see you stressed out like this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544003": "I've detected the presence of an illegal underground group.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544004": "Really? Right here, of all places? I suppose that's a good reason to be worried.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544005": "No, the group is located in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544006": "Huh? When did you go to Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544007": "That's the problem: I've been in Lumopolis this whole time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544008": "Evidently, my powers have gotten so strong that I can sense the current situation in Umbraton from up here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544009": "This kind of power is far beyond someone in my position.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544010": "So why don't you pass on your knowledge to the Umbraton authorities?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544011": "That would be overstepping our boundaries.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544012": "Umbraton has its own rules and regulations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544013": "I have no intention of disrupting the order of things down there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544014": "Likewise, I won't allow anyone to disrupt the peace and order of Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544015": "Oh, well, in that case...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27544016": "I'll just have to wait and see what happens next.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551001": "Good day, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551002": "I notice you haven't had breakfast yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551003": "The brewed tea has gone cold. Are you feeling unwell?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551004": "Sorry, I overslept today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551005": "No need to apologize. Your daily hard work is evident to all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551006": "It's okay to unwind a little.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551007": "The previous work got me worn out, so I woke up late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551008": "Is that the case? Well, then, a bit of slack is perfectly fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551009": "However, punctuality has always been a part of courtesy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551010": "Kindly be more mindful of it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27551011": "It's hard to capture a lady's heart without a sense of time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27552001": "Do you know? In thirty minutes, Soroz will fly over a canyon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27552002": "Is there any danger in that canyon?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27552003": "No, there's no danger. It's just a regular canyon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27552004": "The canyon itself is quite ordinary, but it boasts a breathtaking sunrise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27552005": "This is something you won't find in any travel guide or journal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27552006": "You have quite the eye to discover it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27552007": "Discovering beauty for customers and introducing them to it is the very essence of being a Guide.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27552008": "I'd love to see it for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27552009": "That's exactly why I'm telling you about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27552010": "So, keep an eye out and enjoy the view from the window when we're there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561001": "Someone spilled coffee on my dress during the meal a moment ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561002": "You didn't get scalded, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561003": "Oh, you care about me, don't you? That's so sweet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561004": "Don't worry; I wasn't scalded, but...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561005": "Is your dress stained?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561006": "Yes, it splashed right on the most noticeable part.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561007": "Wearing a stained dress while hosting guests would be considered inappropriate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561008": "Why don't you change into a new dress?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561009": "That might affect our afternoon schedule, and keeping guests waiting would be impolite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561010": "Well, at this point, I'll just have to brew more coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561011": "What's the coffee for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561012": "When one spot is stained, it's a stain.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27561013": "When multiple spots are stained, it becomes a design.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562001": "I'm wondering if I should add something new to my role as a Guide.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562002": "For instance, the dining etiquette in Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562003": "Dining etiquette?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562004": "Exactly, Lumopolis is a land of order, and our dining tables are no exception.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562005": "But I worry about whether the guests would be open to it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562006": "Is it very complicated?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562007": "Let's take lunch as an example.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562008": "Just the sequence of serving the dishes has several corresponding scenarios.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562009": "Does that make the lunch more complicated?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562010": "Yes, for example, eating different types of cabbage requires different types of forks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562011": "According to the soup you're having, there are specific rules on how much you can scoop with each spoonful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562012": "If I were a tourist, I wouldn't want to eat a meal in ways like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562013": "You're absolutely right, and if we were to introduce it, a whole day wouldn't suffice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27562014": "Looks like I better drop this idea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581001": "I've finished my puzzle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581002": "I don't know what to do to kill the rest of the long night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581003": "Don't you need to rest?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581004": "Then, just go to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581005": "That's a genuinely good suggestion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581006": "Unfortunately, I'm a professional Guide.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581007": "I evolved beyond the need for sleep a long time ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581008": "How enviable!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581009": "Oh my, you too wish for an evolution that forsakes sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581010": "It's doable, but it comes at a price...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581011": "Wait, this doesn't feel right. I'll just pass.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27581012": "You're giving up? That's a pity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27582001": "Navigator, have you decided what to wear tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27582002": "No, why you ask?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27582003": "Don't just disregard your appearance like that, young one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27582004": "Getting everything ready for the next day before bedtime is what defines maturity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27582005": "I usually just wear whatever I can find.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27582006": "Hmm, that can't be called an elegant habit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27582007": "How about next time I help you choose the right outfit?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27582008": "Well then, Ms. Blanc, help me decide what I should wear tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27582009": "That's what I had in mind. My pleasure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27582010": "Rest assured. As a Guide, it's my job to keep our client content.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601001": "I should have time to spare soon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601002": "I'd like to take you somewhere to relax. ",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601003": "What do you have in mind? Somewhere fun?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601004": "We got two options...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601005": "There's a new island around Harbor City.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601006": "It's supposed to have many unusual sceneries and creatures.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601007": "Then there's the amusement park in Northland.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601008": "Where supposedly everybody's fantasies and wishes will come true. ",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601009": "Where do you want to go?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601010": "Harbor City.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601011": "Northland.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27601012": "I want to go there too. Let's hit it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602001": "Are you in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602002": "No. I'm somewhat sleepy but don't want to go to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602003": "That happens to me quite often too. Now I just toss and turn by myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602004": "Whereas when I was a child, my mom would read me bedtime stories.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602005": "Bedtime stories from mom... I'm jealous. That must've been a delight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602006": "Hey, don't be sad now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602007": "I can tell you a bedtime story to get you to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602008": "Heh, that's all right. I'm not a kid anymore, either.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602009": "Bedtime stories are for big kids too, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602010": "Okay, here I go!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602011": "Once upon a time, there was a brave little boy... who lived all alone...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602012": "One day, he ran across some bandits and tailed them...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602013": "In the end, he got the treasure and married the girl he loved!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602014": "What an interesting story.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602015": "Feel sleepy yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602016": "More than before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602017": "Good night, then. Sweet dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27602018": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603001": "Are you free tomorrow night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603002": "Yeah. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603003": "Well, there's a party tomorrow night and, uh, I want you to go with me as a date.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603004": "Why are you stuttering? It's not your usual self at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603005": "Don't tell me it's a prankster party?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603006": "No, it's an awesome party!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603007": "What kind of party is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603008": "It has a secret motif and it's invitation-only.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603009": "Everyone must be in a special costume and mask.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603010": "No one's allowed to reveal their true identity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603011": "The purpose is to free everyone from preconceptions due to physical appearance and status.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603012": "So they can find their soul companion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603013": "I see. That sounds interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603014": "I'll be wearing a tight black dress with gold patterns and glitter.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603015": "Plus a black feather mask. Make sure you find me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603016": "Didn't you say you're not supposed to reveal your identity?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27603017": "How else are you going to know it's me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27604001": "Got a minute, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27604002": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27604003": "I'll be waiting for you in the Lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27604999": "It's her first time on the Colossus, Lorelei must have run into some troubles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641001": "Hello, my name is Lorelei, currently investing in and building entertainment properties.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641002": "Feel free to see me if you're interested in related projects. Here's my business card.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641003": "Hello. Sorry, but I don't have a business card for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641004": "You got the best business card around in this one-of-a-kind Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641005": "I'm elated to be invited to the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641006": "I hope you'll have a good time here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641007": "I'm sure of it. It's a brand-new experience for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641008": "This far exceeds my expectations. I am very excited right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641009": "I've been dreaming about coming ever since I learned of your exploits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641010": "I'm glad to see you like it here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641011": "You can count on me to be enthused and sincere, and I hope we can become dependable partners.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27641012": "Absolutely.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642001": "You were looking for me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642002": "No. What gave you that idea?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642003": "From Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642004": "Oh, I remember now, she and I discussed rebuilding Eraveil last month.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642005": "I recalled you're an expert in that area, so I wanted to consult you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642006": "Sure. Let me juggle my schedule and make as much room as I can for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642007": "It's all right. That was a month ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642008": "Has it been a month already?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642009": "I've just been way too busy recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642010": "Yeah, seeing how much you got on your plate, we decided not to bother you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642011": "Well, remember to hit me up next time, then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642012": "And then wait for another month?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27642013": "Hee... I'll endeavor to get back to you in half that time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643001": "Hey, let's go hiking in the mountains today!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643002": "Didn't we do that yesterday?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643003": "Let's go hiking in the woods, then!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643004": "So, you don't have to work lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643005": "I'm swamped. Just approved two minor projects yesterday and stayed up till 3 in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643006": "You should take the day off today to unwind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643007": "I'm good. I've been feeling great.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643008": "I can function just fine even on 3 hours of sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643009": "But I'm tired... My legs are still sore from yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643010": "That just means you have to improve your stamina!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27643011": "Mercy, please...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644001": "What a nice day today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644002": "Huh? It's dark and overcast with thunderstorms!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644003": "I no longer feel anything can restrict me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644004": "It's the most refreshing air with every breath I take.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644005": "That sounds like you're experiencing a certain euphoria.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644006": "Everything that annoyed or dismayed me before feels gone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644007": "And I'm in full control of my life and future.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644008": "You didn't happen to see any infomercials, right? This is a bit concerning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644009": "Heck no.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644010": "I just think I finally realized how far I've come and what I'm capable of.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644011": "I believe I'm independent now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27644012": "Or maybe I should see my mother in Umbraton...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27651001": "Good morning! What are your plans for today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27651002": "Practice drawing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27651003": "Ah! What masterpiece do you have?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27651004": "I can hang it in the hotel I just built.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27651005": "Nah, I'm only doing it for fun.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27651006": "I didn't know that's your hobby.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27651007": "It's been a while so I thought I'd pick it back up today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27651008": "My interest's piqued. Mind if I join you later?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27651009": "Sure, feel free.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652001": "Excuse me, could you have a Firefly to bring me a cup of coffee later?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652002": "Sure thing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652003": "Thanks a lot; you're a lifesaver.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652004": "Make it extra strong and thick as can be.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652005": "Won't that make it too bitter?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652006": "Exactly, I want it bitter. I've been up all night working on some projects.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652007": "Why not just chew on coffee beans instead?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652008": "Good idea; that way, I'd get caffeine more efficiently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652009": "I've been up all night working on a few projects. That's exactly what I need.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652010": "All night? You've been working way too hard.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27652011": "When working for yourself, you'll never find it hard.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27653001": "The sunrise today is so stunning. Have you seen it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27653002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27653003": "Hehe, just got up, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27653004": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27653005": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27653006": "I'm quite fond of the sunrise; why don't you come and check it out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27653007": "It always reminds me of the burning passion of starting a new business.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27653008": "I'd like to see it too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27653009": "Well, you better come here fast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661001": "Hi. Have you had lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661003": "Oh, I was going to treat you to a feast. Too bad you're out of luck.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661004": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661005": "Oh, you're in luck, then. Let me treat you to a feast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661006": "Why would you do that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661007": "I just completed a deal to take over the biggest amusement park in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661008": "Wow, that's awesome! How did you land that opportunity? ",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661009": "I heard the park was in huge debt due to poor management.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661010": "One of the creditors was a close friend and hooked me up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661011": "So what's your idea for rebranding? Anything special?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661012": "I plan to make it into a park with fantasy and adventure themes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661013": "I can't wait! I'm going when it's done.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27661014": "Cool, and I got an annual pass with your name on it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27662001": "Afternoon. I heard you've been traveling a lot lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27662002": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27662003": "I'd like to know if you ran across any large abandoned or aging facilities.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27662004": "Such as hotels, amusement parks and so on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27662005": "Are you looking for your next acquisition?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27662006": "Correct! Since you travel throughout the land, mind keeping a lookout for me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27662007": "No problem. Let me see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27662008": "I went to a poorly managed haunted house in Umbraton. You could check into that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27662009": "Wonderful. I knew you could help.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27663001": "Sigh, I don't have any appetite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27663002": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27663003": "I've eaten everything on the menu and there's nothing new.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27663004": "You can eat the dishes more than once.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27663005": "Nope, I just want to try something I've never tasted before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27663006": "What if it turns out to be awful?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27663007": "That's still a new experience. Just don't order it again and I'll be fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27663008": "But you wouldn't order it again if it tasted good, either...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27663009": "Hee, true!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27664001": "Is work going smoothly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27664002": "Not bad. Inspected the Colossus this morning and everything's fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27664003": "So you're free in the afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27664004": "I got some old movies that were never released. Let's check them out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27664005": "So how did you get your hands on those?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27664006": "The boss of the movie studio was a very good friend of my dad.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27664007": "Even though they're unreleased, they're good movies. Interested?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27664008": "Sure. I'll see you in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665001": "Do you like to travel?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665003": "All right, so do I!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665004": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665005": "It seems you much preferred hanging around places you're familiar with.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665006": "I'm planning my next trip right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665007": "I want to visit a place I've never been to before and check out different people and cultures.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665008": "Is there anywhere on Astra you haven't seen before?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665009": "Of course. I'm interested in many places.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665010": "One of my dreams is to travel to every corner of the land.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27665011": "I hope it'll come true soon!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666001": "It's such torture to break bread with someone you don't like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666003": "I met someone obnoxious yesterday. He looked down on me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666004": "He called me a worthless daddy's girl who knew only how to spend money and nothing about business.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666005": "He said that to you? Who's the guy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666006": "The son of a former partner of my dad. He thinks he's all that and a bag of chips.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666007": "I ran into him at a business event yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666008": "He spent the whole time bragging how great and successful he is.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666009": "While denigrating and insulting me everywhere.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666010": "I oughtta give him the what-for.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666011": "Me too, and I did...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666012": "The corporation he wanted to work with is now my partner!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27666013": "Oh, that's awesome.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667001": "Speaking of it, there's no consistent supplier for resources on Soroz, is there?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667002": "No, there's not.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667003": "So, how about letting me handle it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667004": "What made you think of this all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667005": "Because I went to the Cafe for a meal on a whim.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667006": "The food was fine, but I believe I can make it better with my resources.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667007": "Most importantly, I want everyone to have access to fresh fruits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667008": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667009": "What do you say? If there's a consistent supplier, you might get discounts on prices.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667010": "I'll need to discuss this with everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667011": "I'll think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27667012": "No rush; business cooperation demands careful thought. I'll patiently await your response.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668001": "I had only fruits for lunch today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668002": "Is it okay to eat only fruits?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668003": "Of course, in some parts of the world, fruits can serve as a staple diet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668004": "Plus, fruits offer plenty of sugar and hydration.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668005": "It's perfect for someone like me who constantly needs their brain to be working at full throttle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668006": "But fruits tend to spoil quickly, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668007": "Yes, that's why I've got a giant fridge in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668008": "Don't worry. I'll cover the cost of the fridge and the fruits myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668009": "You should come to my room sometime and try some of these fruits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668010": "Sure, I will when I have the time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27668011": "Hee-hee, I'm looking forward to it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27681001": "I heard about a place called Longzhou today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27681002": "It's supposedly an entirely different land.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27681003": "Yeah, I've been there. The streets are stunning and old-fashioned.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27681004": "I would love to go! You got any way to get there?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27681005": "No, we gotta wait for the ships from Longzhou to come.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27681006": "Sigh, I'm dying to see it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27681007": "I envy you for having visited that land of fantasy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27681008": "Actually, some of the Longzhou natives have settled on Astra.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27681009": "I can introduce you to them when we get a chance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27681010": "That would be great. You're so nice!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682001": "Still up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682002": "Something's troubling me. Can you give me advice?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682003": "Sure. What is the problem? ",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682004": "It's a hotel project. I want to give it a nice, meaningful name.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682005": "But I just can't think of anything good. Any ideas or suggestions?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682006": "Well, that is something important to consider.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682007": "A good name leaves a good first impression, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682008": "What is it you want to get across about the hotel?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682009": "I want to convey the idea that it is an iconic building in Rediesel Desert.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682010": "Anyone who stays will receive the highest level of service and accommodations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682011": "As well as experiencing the unique style and culture of the Rediesel Desert at the same time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682012": "The Desert Prince Hotel",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682013": "The Oasis Garden Hotel",
  "str_quest_chat01_27682014": "Thanks, I believe I'll go with that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683001": "Hey, what did you do today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683002": "Oh, just the same old, same old.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683003": "It's cool, as long as you're comfortable with the pace.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683004": "Allow me to brag a little... I gave an excellent speech today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683005": "Got an ovation from an audience of thousands.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683006": "Wow, that's incredible! Congrats! What was the occasion? ",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683007": "An internal business conference.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683008": "What was the speech about? ",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683009": "My entrepreneurial journey.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683010": "I wanted to inspire more people to pursue their dreams and innovate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27683011": "You did that already.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27684001": "Hey, I heard you want to go to the gym at dinner.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27684002": "Yeah. I want to find a gym that offers a variety of fun activities.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27684003": "Such as seaball, ropeways, and slides.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27684004": "I know a place that fits your needs perfectly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27684005": "It's a recently built gym. It offers many sports and recreation options.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27684006": "You can enjoy and challenge yourself to your heart's content.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27684007": "That sounds great.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27684008": "Just drop my name and you can get in.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27684009": "Don't tell me you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27684010": "Yeah, I funded the construction.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685001": "It's already night, meaning I'm working overtime again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685002": "Do you have to work overtime every day?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685003": "Well, certainly, 'cause there's still tons of work to do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685004": "I don't expect others to work late with me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685005": "But I really want to share the joy of working overtime with someone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685006": "What joy is there in working overtime, seriously?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685007": "You know, the satisfaction that comes after pushing yourself to the max and then letting it all out...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685008": "Would you like to give it a try sometime?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685009": "I respectfully decline...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685010": "Oh, that's too bad.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685011": "Maybe next time I can join you for some overtime work.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685012": "I'll be looking forward to that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27685013": "Alright, I need to get back to work. You should rest early.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27686001": "Hey, how's your sleep been recently?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27686002": "The R&D department at my company created a brand-new ergonomic pillow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27686003": "Since you're one of my most important partners, how about giving it a try?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27686004": "A pillow, huh? Sure, why not?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27686005": "Going by what the R&D folks say.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27686006": "This pillow can provide users with sleep as peaceful as a baby's.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27686007": "That sounds kinda weird...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27686008": "It's all marketing talk, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27686009": "You know what? I actually want to give it a try.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27686010": "Alright, I'll find some time to drop the pillow off in your room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701001": "In the mood for a thrill ride?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701002": "The resort got a new attraction?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701003": "Exactomundo! It's called Pretty Woman!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701004": "I pass.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701005": "What? Why? Not your cup of tea?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701006": "I don't care for the name.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701007": "I don't like thrill rides.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701008": "No, no, no!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701009": "It's actually tailor-made for you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701010": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701011": "Pretty Woman is a female version of Soroz!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701012": "You sit in a roller coaster shaped like a pink Colossus and control its route!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701013": "All sorts of turns and accelerations for you to feel what you've never felt before!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27701014": "Thanks for the explanation. I'll think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702001": "I want to ask you a question that's been bugging me for a long time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702002": "Is it about the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702003": "Are you not comfortable staying here?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702004": "No, that's not it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702005": "I want to know, do you never change clothes? Or are you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702006": "Using some fantastic deodorant?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702007": "Why do you ask that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702008": "Because you're in the same clothes all the time! You never changed, so I think...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702009": "So that's what's been bugging you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702010": "I know, you must have hundreds of the same outfits in your room, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702011": "How should I describe your taste? Consistent or just don't have any?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702012": "I think you got the wrong idea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702013": "You have to be exposed to the adult world soon. I'll take you to Umbraton and pick out clothes when I have time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702014": "Get something the young people are into, at least. You can trust my fashion sense.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27702015": "I'll make you the center of attention on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703001": "Hey, let me ask you, what is charisma?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703002": "Well, I don't really know, either.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703003": "I don't think I'm the person you should ask.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703004": "You should know more about it, from cologne to fashion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703005": "That's all superficial. I'm wondering what made so many people follow you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703006": "It's not following. We're all on the same level as friends.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703007": "Interesting, very interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703008": "Have you ever wondered why so many people love to run around with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703009": "By that, I mean the so-called \"adventures.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703010": "Just a common interest, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703011": "They happened to have the time, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703012": "That's probably your charisma, buddy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703013": "And maybe that's something I'll never understand or achieve.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703014": "That's probably also why I'm willing to \"adventure\" with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703015": "After all that, I think that's what you really meant to say.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703016": "Come to the resort when you get a chance! It has many exciting attractions!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27703017": "That seems to be the case for sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741001": "You're welcome!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741002": "I feel like I should be saying that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741003": "It goes both ways. Since you welcomed me here, I of course welcome you to visit there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741004": "It's a huge resort, and I do mean huge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741005": "I'll visit when I get the chance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741006": "You must. I heard you're a very hard worker, but don't forget to vacay.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741007": "That's because I got a lot on my plate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741008": "You only live once, gotta live it up once in a while.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741009": "Live it up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741010": "Don't tell me you don't know how? You know, like high-diving in a Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741011": "It's just as exciting as any roller coaster ride in the resort!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741012": "Uh, you have to be sensible when piloting the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741013": "So you like the more peaceful options? You can just hang out in the cafe and check out the scenery.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27741014": "Why do I feel you're here to push the resort?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742001": "I don't hear much about your past.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742002": "True.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742003": "I guess you don't want to talk about it, and I understand that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742004": "Understand?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742005": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742006": "So what do you wanna know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742007": "Actually, it's not what I wanna know. I just think you and I are kind of alike to some extent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742008": "We both got a past we don't want to bring up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742009": "Perhaps.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742010": "It's okay. No matter what the past holds, time is the foundation of the healing process, and joy is the remedy that springs from it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742011": "So come to my resort when you're free! I won't charge you much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742012": "I promise you'll come loaded and leave totally relieved!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742013": "You mean, clean me out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742014": "That's right!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742015": "I'll have to think about that one...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27742016": "Anyway, you're welcome!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743001": "Got a serious question for you. Hope you can answer it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743002": "Ask away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743003": "Who do you like, Vice or Carleen?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743004": "Why would you ask that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743005": "Because it leads to the next question.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743006": "Give me a second...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743007": "Never mind. You're hemming and hawing because you're not sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743008": "Or maybe you're intimidated by my charm?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743009": "What are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743010": "Nothing, just making an observation. Romantic issues are truly something you can't overlook in life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743011": "Everyone must experience the sometimes mystifying and confusing process.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743012": "No matter how the process unfolds, ultimately, one must come back to who they truly are.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743013": "Who they truly are? You mean that we must remain true to ourselves in the end, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743014": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743015": "Only by being true to your heart can you never regret your choices.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743016": "Then you'll assume the responsibility to walk your own path.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27743017": "I get it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744001": "The Colossus is truly spectacular when soaring through the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744002": "Are you enjoying it? No, you can't see the entire Colossus from your vantage point.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744003": "Just making an observation, because I never thought I could see such a sky one day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744004": "A sky so high...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744005": "You like to watch from high places, I presume?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744006": "No, it just reminds me of myself, hence the remark.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744007": "After all, I've been spending my life living only in the moment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744008": "But I think you're still pretty serious, at least serious about enjoying life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744009": "That's not actually serious. It's just living haphazardly like a bug.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744010": "But even a bug with a fleeting lifespan...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744011": "Would look to the sky above and fantasize \"If only I could fly...\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744012": "Now that I'm indeed in the sky, it actually feels somewhat surreal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744013": "That's some deep thoughts there, but you can't be a bug if you could think that way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744014": "What you wanted to say is actually the \"On top of the world\" cliche, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27744015": "Yeah, whatever, as long as you're enjoying the view.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27751001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27751002": "Oh, morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27751003": "Don't you think it's a little forced to greet me like that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27751004": "But that's how you greeted me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27751005": "That's because I got something to say before you interrupted.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27751006": "How did you manage to turn it around on me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27752001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27752002": "You're up early. Got anything particular to do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27752003": "No, I only wanted to see daybreak.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27752004": "Just to see the sun rise?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27752005": "Because to me, it means a new day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27752006": "The sun serves as a powerful reminder that I must live well in the new day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27752007": "But aren't all daybreaks like that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27752008": "Oh no, to me, every dawn is different.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27753001": "Morning! Rise and shine!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27753002": "Did you come just to get me out of bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27753003": "That's right! I got up too early this morning. It was still dark when I opened my eyes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27753004": "I went back to sleep, but noticed it was dawn soon enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27753005": "Guess I'm the first one out of bed today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27753006": "You've been waiting to send me a wake-up call ever since you opened your eyes, weren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27753007": "Correct!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27754001": "Are you having breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27754002": "Right now, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27754003": "No, not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27754004": "What are you having?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27754005": "I'm mixing a special drink that's delicious and refreshing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27754006": "It's not a kind of adult beverage, is it? Shouldn't have alcohol in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27754007": "Well, I'll skip the recommendation since you said that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27755001": "I got something I must remind you to kick off the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27755002": "What can be that urgent?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27755003": "You're almost an adult, and given you have so many people around you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27755004": "You must mind your image, especially your appearance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27755005": "Like combing and washing your hair.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27755006": "But even though you don't seem to care how you dress, your hair still looks presentable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27755007": "Are you naturally that way, or do the Fireflies help you out when you're asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27755008": "Regardless, thanks for the reminder.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27756001": "What a fresh new day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27756002": "You sound happy. You must've had a good night's sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27756003": "No, I just got out of the shower.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27756004": "You like to shower in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27756005": "Yes. This way, I'll be clean and tidy for the whole day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27756006": "I suggest you do the same.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27756007": "I'll think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757001": "Good morning, buddy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757002": "You seem to be putting in some serious work lately. How about taking a break today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757003": "Sure, since my work's almost wrapped up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757004": "Fantastic! How about we unwind together?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757005": "But Soroz...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757006": "Hey, take it easy on yourself. You know, balance is the key to success...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757007": "How about I take you down there and chill out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757008": "How?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757009": "Well, we'll hit up places like the plaza and check out the ladies passing by.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757010": "Nothing beats this for relaxation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27757011": "I'll pass...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758001": "Guess what? I've got an exciting discovery to share!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758002": "A discovery... You're not talking about something inappropriate, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758003": "Why would you say that? This is a serious discovery!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758004": "When mixing mocktail with milk, you'll get a drink unique in both texture and taste; you might want to give it a shot sometime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758005": "You're already drinking so early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758006": "I just misplaced the unfinished drink from last night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758007": "I was so hungover that I poured it into the milk, thinking it was cocoa.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758008": "Sounds like a disaster in the making...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758009": "You gotta try things before you can judge them, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758010": "Just one sip, and my hangover is gone like magic.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758011": "But its taste might be too strong for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758012": "If ladies around me ever find out I let you have something like this, I'll be in trouble for sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27758013": "Oh well, I'll just have to keep this incredible drink to myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761001": "Wow, the sun is really blazing at noon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761002": "PlayerName, do you want to be popular among girls?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761003": "I do! I really do!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761004": "Well then, get ready with some sunscreen, and let's head outside for a sunbath.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761005": "Well, maybe not so much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761006": "Buddy, life would be way too boring without ambition.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761007": "Come on, let's head outside for a sunbath.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761008": "Get a sun-kissed, passionate tan.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761009": "The girls on the Colossus will go crazy for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761010": "Will they really... I really doubt it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27761011": "Of course. Trust me; I'm an expert on this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762001": "Buddy, I won't be having lunch on Soroz today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762002": "You don't have to prepare my share.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762003": "Are you going out to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762004": "You're not going on a date, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762005": "Yes! It's with the girl who treated me to a meal before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762006": "And it's at the best restaurant in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762007": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762008": "What, you wanna eat there too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762009": "Maybe next time, I'll take you along.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762010": "I'm just wondering if this is really okay...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762011": "What are you thinking? I made the restaurant reservation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762012": "She took care of me a lot in the past, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762013": "Now that she's feeling down, it's perfectly normal to treat her to a meal and listen to her, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27762014": "Oh, I see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27781001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27781002": "Evening. Still up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27781003": "I went by your room and saw your light was still on. Try not to work so hard.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27781004": "Or were you actually playing games in your room?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27781005": "I'll go to bed now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27782001": "No date tonight?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27782002": "The way you put that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27782003": "Guess you don't have a date. Are you too busy with work to get one?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27782004": "When I get a chance I'll take you out to eat in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27782005": "Schnitzel, carbonated drink, bread with jam... Should be your favorites.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27782006": "And I'll enjoy the expensive imported cocktails while I'm at it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27782007": "That's the real reason for this!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27783001": "I really wish you could smell this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27783002": "What are you saying this late at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27783003": "I'm testing out a new cologne.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27783004": "So what scent is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27783005": "That of a sophisticated man: steady, dependable, and a hint of resignation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27783006": "Those aren't the words to describe scents.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27783007": "Yes, they are. You'll get it one day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27784001": "Do you know where I can collect dewdrops?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27784002": "Dewdrops? What for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27784003": "To make colognes, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27784004": "You find dewdrops in the morning. Now is nighttime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27784005": "That's why I planning a stakeout right now and collect as soon as it's morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27784006": "Knock yourself out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27785001": "Hi! How about some coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27785002": "Coffee at night? Are you working overtime?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27785003": "I guess you would say that. I drink it only because I just can't fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27785004": "Don't you think coffees feel different with how a spoon clangs in a mug in the evening?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27785005": "Uh, I think you can't sleep because you're drinking coffee so late...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786001": "Are you going to bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786002": "Not yet, what's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786003": "I really want to share my current feelings with you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786004": "I was just about to go to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786005": "Hehe, looks like I asked at the perfect time then. I want you to share my happiness...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786006": "Share what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786007": "I... finally found my true love.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786008": "You found true love? Really?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786009": "... I never thought I'd be like this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786010": "I thought I was in it for some fun, but...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786011": "After completing the game the eighth time, I unlocked all the endings and CGs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786012": "And right now, I'm totally captivated by her.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786013": "Turns out you're talking about a dating game, ha!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786014": "Come on, your reaction is way too exaggerated!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786015": "In the beginning, I was just curious about what young folks like to play these days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786016": "As it turns out, I got hooked without even realizing it. Hmph, I'm more naive than I thought.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786017": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27786018": "Anyway, I highly recommend it. I doubt you'll ever find such a perfect girl in real life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787001": "Hmm... there's nothing going on tonight, but I just can't sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787002": "You brought this on yourself, staying up every night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787003": "Can't blame me; the real fun starts when the night falls!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787004": "Your biological clock is messed up, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787005": "Probably, but do I have to spend this long night alone?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787006": "PlayerName, what do you say we go have some fun?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787007": "Fun? What kind of fun are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787008": "Like, we could head up to the deck and chill in the night breeze?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787009": "We'd probably get swept away by the winds in the thousand-feet-high troposphere.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787010": "And then we can leap from the night sky and parachute down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787011": "Who on earth goes for extreme sports in the dead of night?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787012": "And after landing, we can light a campfire.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787013": "What if we land in the sea?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787014": "We can catch some fish, BBQ it, and then sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787015": "By the time we finish all that, it'll be morning. Is there any point in sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787016": "Hmm! That's a great plan! Let's do it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27787017": "... I'm heading to lock the cabin door right away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801001": "Hello!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801002": "Excuse me, PlayerName, but what do you think of the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801003": "You mean Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801004": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801005": "The Giant Lizard?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801006": "No, no, I mean Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801007": "I should probably call it a Giant Eagle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801008": "Actually, I get it either way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801009": "I see Soroz as a buddy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801010": "Anything else?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801011": "As my home?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801012": "Yes, that's how I feel lately, too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801013": "The more I see the Giant Eagle, the more used to it I get.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801014": "I even want to bring Giant Lizard along for a few days sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801015": "That's quite all right, there won't be enough room for it here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27801016": "You like living here is good enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802001": "Hi, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802002": "I say, have you been paying attention to me lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802003": "Paying attention to you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802004": "More of what everyone referred to as \"presence\", to be precise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802005": "Presence?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802006": "Yes, presence. You're definitely not the same as the Rediesel Wrench guys.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802007": "I think you probably had a hard time fitting in there...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802008": "Not exactly. More like nobody wanted to hear what I had to say.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802009": "Though it seems to be the case here too... But at least you'll hear me out, PlayerName",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802010": "Well, you give good suggestions most of the time, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802011": "So you will listen to me? That's great.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802012": "I hope you can keep it like this in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27802013": "No problem, Bopper.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27803001": "PlayerName, I've got some good stuff for you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27803002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27803003": "It's a secret for now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27803004": "Come meet me at the Lumina Grid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27803999": "Go and meet up with Bopper!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841001": "The tail! Stand on end now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841002": "Don't you mean you can stand on your head?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841003": "Tail standing on end? How did you do that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841004": "Did you cut it off?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841005": "No, you got it all wrong!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841006": "I can use my tail to help me stand on my head!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841007": "And I can keep it up with just the tail...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841008": "That sounds like a useless skill.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841009": "No, that means I have better control over my body.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841010": "Oh, and it can be useful in certain situations, like...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841011": "Like...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841012": "Anyway, it will come in handy somehow, I'm sure!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27841013": "All right. I guess it's congratulations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842001": "Have you ever been in quicksand before, Caelestite?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842002": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842003": "That's very dangerous, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842004": "Right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842005": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842006": "That's good, because quicksands are very dangerous.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842007": "However, I discovered a way to control them recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842008": "Control a quicksand? That's impressive!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842009": "So you can levitate it into a sandstorm?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842010": "No, not that impressive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842011": "But it will allow the people trapped to walk out safely.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842012": "How do you do that? Solidify the sand?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842013": "Manipulate the sand to push, or maybe toss, them out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842014": "\"Toss\"? Haha, I like the sound of that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842015": "Why are you chuckling?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842016": "Because I can see it vividly! If Rediesel Wrench guys fell into quicksand and got tossed out...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842017": "I'd toss them so hard, they'd be swallowing mouthful of sand!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842018": "That's what they get for not paying attention to me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27842019": "Uh, you should focus on saving people...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843001": "I saw the future for Rediesel Wrench!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843002": "The future? You mean the goal for your team?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843003": "Are you building bases?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843004": "Are you carving out your own turf?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843005": "None of the above!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843006": "I want to make Giant Lizard fly!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843007": "That sounds difficult.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843008": "What about giving it wings, or maybe a jetpack?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843009": "It will be harder than you think.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843010": "What if we merged Giant Eagle and Giant Lizard together?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843011": "Absolutely not!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843012": "Anyway, whatever gave you that idea?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843013": "I'm the strategist for Rediesel Wrench, so it falls under my domain.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27843014": "Well, you're a certified strategist for having that idea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27851001": "Good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27851002": "You sound weird.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27851003": "It's because I'm eating ice cream.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27851004": "Ice cream early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27851005": "Yeah. It's delicious. Lizard flavor.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27851006": "Where did you get the ice cream?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27851007": "Hold it, lizard flavor?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27851008": "You want it? I can have Fireflies send some over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27851009": "No, that's all right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27852001": "I crave cream puffs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27852002": "In the morning? Not that it's available on the Colossus, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27852003": "Because they're problematic to make and the Fireflies don't know how.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27852004": "Sigh, I heard there's a shop in Umbraton that sells them in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27852005": "And the owner has to start preparation before dawn. That's too early to be working.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27852006": "But Rediesel Wrench don't have any shop like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27852007": "Do I have to go to Umbraton just for the puffs?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27852008": "Can't believe it's so tough just to get a bite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27853001": "Any plans today, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27853002": "Just started making the schedule.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27853003": "Still mulling.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27853004": "Okay. Anyway, it's necessary to have a plan!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27853005": "You can't run such a big place without a plan, right? Fortunately, you have help...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27853006": "The Fireflies! They follow you and carry out your plans without wavering.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27853007": "Unlike the Rediesel Wrench... Where do I even begin...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27853008": "This is actually a rant about them, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854002": "Morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854003": "Uh... Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854004": "Still sleeping? Drop me a line if you see this, alright?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854005": "Good morning. I just saw your messages.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854006": "Morning... Thanks for your response...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854007": "You've sent lots of good-morning messages, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854008": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854009": "You're really an early bird, Bopper.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854010": "I didn't, like, wake you up, did I?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854011": "Folks usually ignore me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854012": "So sometimes, I can't help but say things many times.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27854013": "Anyway, I'm just here to say good morning, nothing important.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855001": "I'm really exhausted... didn't get much sleep last night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855002": "Not used to sleeping on Soroz, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855003": "It may be part of the reason... even though the Giant Eagle flies really steadily.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855004": "But for some reason, it just feels different from being on the Giant Lizard...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855005": "Perhaps it's because it's flying too steadily.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855006": "Right. On solid ground, the Giant Lizard would sometimes bounce due to the terrain.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855007": "It might be because the beds are different here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855008": "Beds? Indeed, the beds here are all soft and fluffy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855009": "In the Rediesel Wrench, we mostly sleep on hard beds.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855010": "Well, now that we know the reason, it's a piece of cake to solve.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855011": "Can I modify the beds in the rooms?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855012": "You can, but do you know how?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855013": "Of course, I modified things all the time back when I was in the Rediesel Wrench.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27855014": "... It's mostly because none of the Rediesel Wrench folks ever listened to my modification suggestions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27861001": "What would you like to have for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27861002": "Haven't decided yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27861003": "Whatever is there, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27861004": "How about you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27861005": "Fried rediesel lizards, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27861006": "And I even got the ingredients. I just sent the Fireflies to get a stove and firewood!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27861007": "Though they've been gone a long time, so I thought I'd ask you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27861008": "I'm sure they're not going to find those.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27862001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27862002": "You look flustered. What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27862003": "I was eating lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27862004": "When I noticed the schedule is off.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27862005": "It should be a meal after taking the flight today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27862006": "But a lot of people ate before taking the flight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27862007": "What's the difference?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27862008": "It doesn't match the schedule you made. I remember your reason for that was to avoid the turbulence or some such...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27862009": "It's okay. It's all the same. No worries.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27863001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27863002": "How do you feel today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27863003": "Well, you sound like you're in a good mood.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27863004": "That's right, since I saw a very bright sun a few days ago that's totally different from in the desert.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27863005": "That's because you're up in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27863006": "Yeah, the sun looked either blurry or bright red in the desert.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27863007": "I don't like either one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27863008": "Chuck it up to the sand or lack of shades. You guys have it hard over there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27863009": "It's all right, thanks to Giant Lizard.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864001": "Hey, PlayerName, how about we soak up some sunlight after lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864002": "Sounds good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864003": "You, you agreed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864004": "Didn't think you'd know the benefits of sunbathing, my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864005": "Sunbathing does more than boost your vitamin D—it also helps with calcium, enabling you to grow taller.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864006": "You know, it's probably my first sunbathing with friends not being on the Giant Lizard.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864007": "No one in the Rediesel Wrench wants to sunbathe with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864008": "I've invited everyone before, but no one ever responded...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864009": "Maybe everyone has had enough of the sun in the Rediesel Desert...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864010": "... But then again, it's also possible that nobody even heard my invitations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27864011": "... Well, that's indeed awkward.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865001": "PlayerName... The Cafe is discussing next week's lunch menu.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865002": "Did they reach a decision?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865003": "Yes, and my suggestion for Fried Rediesel Worms got denied again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865004": "It's honestly a tasty dish...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865005": "So why doesn't anyone want to vote for it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865006": "I think the issue might be its ingredients...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865007": "Ingredients? Come to think of it, it does seem to be the case.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865008": "To make Fried Rediesel Worms, you need big, fat, and tender desert earthworms.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865009": "Why not suggest something different next time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865010": "Something different? How about the Lizard-Flavored Basque Cake?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865011": "But that would require fresh lizard extract.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865012": "We'll have to wait until Soroz lands and catch fresh ones...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865013": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865014": "Alright, to promote what I love...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865015": "Next time we land, I'll make sure to collect all the ingredients we need!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27865016": "Get ready for a treat, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27881001": "It's getting late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27881002": "Yes. You're still up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27881003": "I had a nap this afternoon as soon as I finished lunch until now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27881004": "Then I skipped dinner.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27881005": "You practically slept the whole day, so it's hard for you to fall asleep now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27881006": "Not exactly. I just had some cream puffs and I'm sleepy again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27881007": "I guess it's good night, then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27881008": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27881009": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27882001": "The breeze sure is comfy at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27882002": "Isn't it, though? But I heard it's the same in the desert, too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27882003": "It depends. Sometimes it's very cold and you need to start a fire...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27882004": "Either that or you bunch up to get warm. Some people would even sleep with my tail in their arms.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27882005": "It's quite different on the Colossus. Not only the temperature is fine...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27882006": "Even the breeze is cozy, whereas the wind in the desert carried sand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27882007": "I think that's a bit...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27882008": "Though I got used to it, so I'm actually uncomfortable sleeping here. Or should I say not used to it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27882009": "So this is about you not able to go to sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27883001": "I just figured out what to call Giant Eagle!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27883002": "Isn't it Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27883003": "It should be the Great Giant Eagle!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27883004": "What? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27883005": "Because it's far bigger than a normal eagle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27883006": "In that case, should you call that giant lizard of yours, Great Giant Lizard?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27883007": "You got a point. But Giant Lizard isn't as big as Giant Eagle... Taking the tail into account, however...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27883008": "But Giant Lizard seems heavier than Giant Eagle, though Giant Eagle has large wings... Oh man...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27883009": "And I got to see Odi to make the proper comparison, but she's not easy to get along with. What should I do, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27883010": "You should not ponder this so late at night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884001": "It's kinda cold tonight, huh, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884002": "Although the Big Eagle seems to control the indoor temperature, it's still a good idea to watch out for colds.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884003": "You too, Bopper.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884004": "Don't worry; I've got my tail for that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884005": "As long as I sleep hugging it, I won't feel cold at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884006": "Tail?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884007": "Yes, my tail may look tough and chewy on the surface.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884008": "However, in reality, it feels soft, cozy, and quite warm.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884009": "I don't believe it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884010": "If you're not convinced, why not give it a hug and find out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884011": "It must be comfy to hug.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884012": "Well, how about hugging it to test it out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27884013": "It's the part I'm most proud of myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885001": "PlayerName, do you have any tricks for falling asleep fast?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885002": "Everyone's been watching horror movies these days, and I've seen a few myself, so...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885003": "Let me think...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885004": "I'm counting on you! I haven't had a good night's sleep in days!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885005": "How about turning up the heat in the room?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885006": "Increasing the room temperature? Indeed, when it's warm, you tend to get drowsy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885007": "I heard that to get a nocturnal lizard to sleep, you need to crank up the room temperature...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885008": "How about lowering the room temperature a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885009": "Lowering the room temperature? Indeed, if it's too cold, all you'll want to do is snuggle under the covers...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885010": "I heard that to get a diurnal lizard to sleep, you need to cool the room...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885011": "... You're not treating me as a lizard, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885012": "Hold on... hold on a sec, my cabinet just moved.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27885013": "I... I should stop talking now; I'm going back to my covers...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901001": "PlayerName, respond if you hear this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901002": "What do you need, Commander Wrath?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901003": "Here!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901004": "You're not one of my subordinates; no need for such formality.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901005": "I'm calling primarily to express my gratitude this time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901006": "Everyone from Illumina has also helped me a lot, so I'm the one who should be grateful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901007": "Plus, I haven't really done much lately, so there's no need for you to thank me personally, Grand Marshal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901008": "That sounds more like sarcasm.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901009": "Not at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901010": "I know. It's me being sensitive—I'm just kinda frustrated with the current situation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27901011": "Anyway, I really appreciate your contributions to Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902001": "PlayerName, there's something I'd like to ask you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902002": "Please go ahead, Commander.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902003": "How do I look recently? Just share your first impressions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902004": "You look very majestic and imposing, Grand Marshal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902005": "Although it's completely different from Grand Marshal Reinhardt, I can still perceive your unique aura.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902006": "And I believe everyone feels the same way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902007": "That's good to hear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902008": "I sense a bit of weariness in your appearance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902009": "Commander Wrath, you still exude the same imposing presence as before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902010": "However, is it because the Grand Marshal's workload is heavier than anticipated?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902011": "I feel... you look somewhat...weary lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902012": "Is it already that obvious...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902013": "Actually, there's a feeling inside me that's hard to put into words.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902014": "Or should I call it fear?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902015": "Within the Illumina Federation, there's a shadow that not even a Grand Marshal can easily dispel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902016": "What are their intentions? Am I capable of protecting the citizens of Illumina?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902017": "I have no answer to such questions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902018": "To everyone, you are undoubtedly a worthy Grand Marshal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902019": "No matter what happens, we will always stand by your side.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902020": "... Really?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27902021": "What you say means a lot to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903001": "You there, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903002": "Grand Marshal Wrath?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903003": "You don't have to be so formal here—it's not Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903004": "Understood, Commander Wrath.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903005": "I said you don't have to... Forget it, call me whatever you want.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903006": "I've reviewed the records of all your past activities.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903007": "I assure you: I've always abided by the law!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903008": "So, is there anything wrong with my records?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903009": "Don't worry. Your records are perfectly fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903010": "The more I get to know you, the more intrigued I am—",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903011": "You, as the only surviving Caelestite, must have experienced much greater loneliness and powerlessness than I ever have.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903012": "So what keeps you fighting to this extent?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903013": "It's my fellow Caelestites.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903014": "Peace is the ideal every Caelestite pursues.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903015": "I'm not really into fighting, but I understand that avoiding battles won't bring about true peace.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903016": "To prevent another tragedy like what happened in Eraveil, I need to step up and do what's required of me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903017": "It's my companions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903018": "I know this might sound cliché.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903019": "But for those who've had my back, I'll stand and fight till the very end.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903020": "Your answer is pretty much what I expected, but it's enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903021": "Maybe I just wanted to hear it from you in person...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903022": "Anyhow, your encouragement is making me feel a whole lot better.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903023": "Commander Wrath, everyone will have your back.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903024": "Our conversation, please keep it between us.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27903025": "That's enough talk for today. I'll catch up with you later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904002": "Speaking, Commander Wrath.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904003": "Just call me Wrath when we're off duty on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904004": "I'd prefer not to...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904005": "Alright, no problem. Just go with whatever feels right for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904006": "I'm contacting you for something we talked about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904007": "Something we talked about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904008": "I'm not sure if you still remember...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904009": "I said if I'd become the Grand Marshal, the top choice for my deputy would be Reinhardt... or you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904010": "Are you asking me to take that position?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904011": "Did you ever say something like that? I don't...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904012": "With Reinhardt gone now, I could use your help.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904013": "I don't agree with Reinhardt's approach.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904014": "Hence, I'll try to uphold Illumina's honor my own way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904015": "But I must admit, there are matters within Illumina that my strength alone can't resolve.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904016": "It's rare to hear you talk like this, Commander Wrath...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904017": "Indeed, it's not easy for one to acknowledge their own vulnerabilities in certain aspects.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904018": "But if it leads to having your assistance, then it's worth it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904019": "I don't believe I can offer much assistance...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904020": "Sorry, but the crew on Soroz still needs me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904021": "... As expected.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904022": "Still, me and everyone on Soroz will do everything we can to support you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904023": "But not as your deputy, but rather as your friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904024": "Understood.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904025": "My friend, no, Illumina's friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904026": "If you ever change your mind, feel free to reach out to me anytime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27904027": "There'll always be a place for you by my side.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941001": "Grand Marshal Wrath of the Illumina Federation has come for a visit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941002": "It's been a while, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941003": "You're still as spirited as ever, Commander Wrath.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941004": "Well, thanks to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941005": "Here's the thing, every time I see the Colossus, I can't help but think...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941006": "If we were to put together a parachuting division from our soldiers...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941007": "Commander...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941008": "Oh... Nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941009": "Since becoming the Grand Marshal, I've been thinking more about military affairs without even realizing it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941010": "Alright, that's enough for saying hello today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941011": "On behalf of the Illumina Federation, I once again extend greetings to our Caelestite comrade.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27941012": "Splendor Illumina!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942001": "The Red Baron seems to have become lighter to brandish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942002": "Such improvement feels more significant than the gains from training.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942003": "I'm just playing a supportive role here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942004": "All I'm doing is merely channeling the Lumina.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942005": "The decisive factor is still the warriors themselves.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942006": "This is your hard work paying off, Commander Wrath.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942007": "I don't have the power to directly boost everyone's strength.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942008": "The significant improvement you're experiencing is mostly attributed to your efforts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942009": "I get it. I'm not disregarding the importance of daily progress.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942010": "Illumina soldiers are never lax when it comes to training.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942011": "But if they can also get the guidance, it could drastically boost their chances of survival.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942012": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942013": "I was just talking; no need for you to dwell on it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942014": "I don't want to increase the load you're already carrying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942015": "None of us from Illumina would want any mishaps on our allies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942016": "Don't worry, Grand Marshal—I'll do my best to guide everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942017": "Just do what's within your capacity, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27942018": "After all, ensuring everyone's safe return should've been my responsibility as Grand Marshal of Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943001": "Reinhardt used to say that if one clings to his fist without striking, he'll end up with nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943002": "But she also said...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943003": "When necessary, we'll aim our fists at the true enemy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943004": "PlayerName, who should my fist be aiming at?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943005": "W-Why do you ask that, all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943006": "Maybe it has something to do with what I went through in Twilight...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943007": "My strength is growing, yet I'm getting less sure about where to point my spear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943008": "Toward the Eclipsites.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943009": "I have no idea what's been happening within Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943010": "But for us, the Eclipsites are the only true enemies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943011": "True, I shouldn't be having such doubts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943012": "Whatever happens among the Aurorians, we are still compatriots.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943013": "Those who do evil shall be punished.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943014": "But my spear is meant solely to send the Eclipsites to their demise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943015": "Toward those who set up Reinhardt.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943016": "Those who schemed against Grand Marshal Reinhardt...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943017": "Perhaps they had their reasons.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943018": "But no matter what, those who harm their own compatriot should not be forgiven easily.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943019": "You're right. Victory can only be achieved when we stand united.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943020": "Harming our own fellow will only shred the trust that binds us.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943021": "I believe I've understood what needs to be done now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27943022": "I'll keep your advice close to my heart, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944001": "When I challenge Reinhardt next time, she'll surely be taken aback.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944002": "But before that happens, I'll handle everything my own way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944003": "PlayerName, I must thank you for helping me make up my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944004": "Me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944005": "Since becoming Grand Marshal, I've been thinking, \"What would Reinhardt do?\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944006": "To keep the soldiers undistracted, she kept certain matters beyond our awareness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944007": "So my sight was veiled until I first encountered those things...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944008": "At times, I was on the brink of collapse, constantly questioning myself...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944009": "I'm immensely grateful to you for giving me the strength to keep moving forward.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944010": "It's what I should do as your ally.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944011": "The strength I gave you might not be as substantial as you think...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944012": "It's not about how much strength you give me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944013": "Having strength alone doesn't guarantee victory against a much stronger foe.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944014": "But the increase in strength undeniably instills courage in one's heart.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944015": "Whether in the role of Grand Marshal or as Wrath myself...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27944016": "I won't be lost anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951001": "Do you copy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951002": "Copy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951003": "Well done, you're getting faster.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951004": "Are you taking it more seriously because of who I am now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951005": "Maybe a little...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951006": "You shouldn't let my position intimidate you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951007": "Well, that's not it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951008": "No? All right then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951009": "No matter the status of who you're facing, you must keep your response time optimal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951010": "Of course, I know you'd never treat others differently because of that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951011": "You passed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27951012": "I did? Thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27952001": "Are you awake? Get ready for your morning workout.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27952002": "This early?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27952003": "Early? I'm sending you this because I'm already back from my morning drill.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27952004": "Don't tell me you've been slacking off again lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27952005": "Sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27952006": "Don't just feel sorry. The result of not training will show on the battlefield.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27952007": "It is better to put in the effort now than to regret it later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27952008": "I'm going to start training. You ought to get moving too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27952009": "I will!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961001": "Quit staring at the terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961002": "But I just picked it up...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961003": "Doing that is the beginning of procrastination.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961004": "How did you know?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961005": "Your habits and routines are very predictable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961006": "Even on lunch break, you cannot be too complacent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961007": "Got it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961008": "But if you're sending messages to me, doesn't that mean you're on the terminal as well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961009": "Well... You're my best prospect for a lieutenant, so I have to be tougher on you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961010": "After messaging you, I'll put the terminal down and won't look at it again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27961011": "I-Is that so...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27962001": "Did you have lunch, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27962002": "I'm about to.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27962003": "Remember to mind the time and portions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27962004": "I just finished eating.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27962005": "Remember to write down what you had for the day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27962006": "Thanks for the thought, but what brought that up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27962007": "I've found I would overeat aboard Soroz if I didn't pay enough attention.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27962008": "And how can I challenge Reinhardt if I'm so undisciplined?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27962009": "I am in deep reflection right now, so I want to remind you to avoid the same mistake.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27962010": "Got it. Thanks for the reminder.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27981001": "Don't forget about the drill tomorrow morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27981002": "Copy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_27981003": "Don't be so tight. It's only a reminder.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27981004": "This is the time to relax and unwind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27981005": "Okay. You too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27981006": "Not my turn yet. There's still a lot of things to ponder over in Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27981007": "Anything I can help with?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27981008": "It's okay, they're my problems. I'm used to it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27981009": "Try meditating before bedtime. It should be beneficial to your work next day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27981010": "Sure, I'll give it a go.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27982001": "Are you still up, by chance?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27982002": "Yes. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_27982003": "I was just meditating about when you become my right hand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27982004": "Plenty of problems just may be resolved with ease.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27982005": "Well, I'm not that good...",
  "str_quest_chat01_27982006": "Don't underestimate yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27982007": "But I also know now is not the best time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27982008": "Sorry about always tying you to the issues in Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27982009": "Have a nice sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_27982010": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001001": "Hi there, PlayerName. Sorry to bother you again today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001002": "No worries. You're always welcome at Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001003": "By the way, you've been visiting Soroz a lot for prayers recently, Miss Joselyne.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001004": "Yes. I've got some thoughts in my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001005": "PlayerName, where do you think the God of Light resides?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001006": "Huh? If you're asking me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001007": "Up in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001008": "If we say the sun is the embodiment of the God of Light...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001009": "Then the God of Light should also be up in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001010": "An intriguing yet quite reasonable thought.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001011": "That's why I think if I were to pray while riding the Colossus in the sky...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001012": "Would the God of Light be able to hear my wishes more distinctly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001013": "In the hearts of us.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001014": "Though I'm not fully versed in religious stuff...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001015": "But what they call faith is something deeply rooted in their hearts, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001016": "You're right. The God of Light is deeply rooted within the heart of every believer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001017": "That's why I think if I were to pray while riding the Colossus among the clouds...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001018": "Would there be more citizens to see it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001019": "And could it ignite the light within more hearts?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001020": "So this is what you've been thinking, Joselyne.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001021": "Yeah. The Colossus soars through the sky, bridging the sun and the earth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001022": "And I want to bridge those in Twilight and the God of Light...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001023": "Just like what you did, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001024": "No, no, you're exaggerating...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001025": "I'm not exaggerating—that is the truth. Though I'm often referred to as a saint who guides others, I feel that you can actually guide everyone better than I can, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28001026": "White Night up high! May the God of Light bless you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002001": "Miss Joselyne, is there something you need?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002002": "Yeah, there's this thing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002003": "Feel free to say no if it's too much trouble, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002004": "I won't turn you down, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002005": "Actually, it's from the kids in the Church...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002006": "They've heard that Soroz is docking near Twilight these days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002007": "So they keep going on about how they want to board it and take a look.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002008": "I'll arrange it right away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002009": "I'm pretty sure no one will have a problem with it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002010": "Miss Joselyne, just let me know when you decide on a time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002011": "I'll have Fireflies act as guides for everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002012": "Kids in the church?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002013": "What do you mean by the kids in the church?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002014": "They're orphans under the care of the God of Light Church in Twilight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002015": "Sorry for not being clear enough. I'm used to avoiding saying things like orphans or orphanages in front of them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002016": "My apologies. I should've thought of that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002017": "Miss Joselyne, feel free to bring them over anytime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002018": "(Voice Message) *&$&……%@#（3s）",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002019": "Um... Miss Joselyne?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002020": "Sorry, the kids got a bit too excited and grabbed the terminal from me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002021": "They've never left Twilight before, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002022": "Just like me when I was their age.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002023": "Miss Joselyne...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002024": "Sorry, PlayerName. I tend to talk a lot about myself when chatting with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002025": "The residents in Twilight always call me the \"Saint.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002026": "I understand it's a gesture of trust, but it does make me feel a bit distant from them at times.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002027": "Rarely is the occasion for me to chat about these things.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002028": "I'm all ears as long as you're willing to share, Miss Joselyne.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002029": "OK...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28002030": "White Night up high! Thank the Holy Light for bringing you and me together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003001": "White Night up high... Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003002": "Good morning... *yawn*",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003003": "I do apologize for messaging at such an early hour—it appears you might still be in need of forty winks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003004": "Make that fifty... I'm going back to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003005": "Forget about it. I'm already up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003006": "Hard work keeps one's spirits high. You'd do well to remember that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003007": "Is that even a real saying?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003008": "Regardless, I have a few matters at hand requiring your assistance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003009": "And although these matters are more or less the same as those I attend to on a daily basis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003010": "I have an appointment today that I must keep, and in order to do so, the errands in question must be completed earlier than usual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003011": "Could you possibly help me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003012": "Of course I can, it's not like I have anything better to do today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003013": "White Night up high! Bless your kind heart.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003014": "I'll be waiting for you in the Lounge—we'll set off together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28003999": "Seeking help isn't really Joselyne's style. But since she's been looking out for you, it's time to return the favor.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041001": "So this is how it feels...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041002": "How is it? Are you getting used to it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041003": "It's alright. It's not too far off from what I expected.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041004": "The guidance from the God of Light feels clearer now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041005": "All thanks to you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041006": "A piece of cake.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041007": "Your dedication, Miss Joselyne, matters in this too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041008": "I want you to know that I'm truly thankful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041009": "With such strength...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041010": "I definitely can better protect everyone in Twilight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041011": "During my prayers, I'll speak of your support to the God of Light.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041012": "May the God of Light bless you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041013": "You don't have to be that formal...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041014": "Reveal the deeds of the guilty, imploring the God of Light to pass judgment upon the malevolent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041015": "Sing praises for acts of goodness, petitioning the God of Light to bless our brethren.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041016": "This is my duty.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28041017": "White Night up high. May the mercy of god be with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042001": "White Night up high. PlayerName, have you been facing any troubles recently?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042002": "Not really. Why do you ask?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042003": "I've been listening to others' troubles, hoping to lend a hand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042004": "I've heard about it from others.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042005": "The word is, Miss Joselyne, you've been actively searching to discover what's been bothering everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042006": "Though you've always been guiding and helping everyone, Miss Joselyne...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042007": "It seems like you've been taking the initiative a bit too much lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042008": "Is there something going on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042009": "Nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042010": "It's just that since my power enhancement last time, I've been having this odd feeling...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042011": "Feeling overly energetic?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042012": "Feeling uncomfortable?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042013": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042014": "I just feel like... compared to the increase in power...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042015": "My personal efforts are still far from enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042016": "I should be more devout and diligent. Otherwise, I'd be unworthy of the blessings from the God of Light.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042017": "... and even more unworthy of your help, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042018": "This is what I should do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042019": "You've already been devout and diligent enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042020": "For the glory of Olivier, for the residents of Twilight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042021": "I should not stop here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042022": "At least take care of yourself and get some rest, Miss Joselyne.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042023": "Alright, I will.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28042024": "White Night up high. May the mercy of god be with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051002": "Good morning, Miss Joselyne...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051003": "Did you not get enough rest, by any chance?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051004": "I was busy last night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051005": "After all, the sun hasn't even risen yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051006": "Sorry. I didn't consider your schedule...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051007": "No worries. It's good to wake up early sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051008": "I just picked some fresh tomatoes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051009": "I'll bring them to Soroz in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051010": "You're too kind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051011": "It's nothing. I just hope you guys like them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28051012": "Oh, remember to have breakfast first before eating the tomatoes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28052001": "Miss Joselyne?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28052002": "I'm here, what's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28052003": "I noticed you seemed quite busy a moment ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28052004": "What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28052005": "Nothing to worry about—some prayer materials just ran out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28052006": "Am I bothering you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28052007": "Doing your prayers this early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28052008": "No worries, I'm already awake.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28052009": "You know what they say, the early bird gets the worm, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28052010": "White Night up high. May the blessings of dawn shower upon you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28053001": "PlayerName, are you already up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28053002": "Yeah, what's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28053003": "I want to go check on the children at the church.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28053004": "They've been eagerly waiting to hear about the stories about you and the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28053005": "So could you come along with me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28053006": "Of course you can!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28053007": "Thank you so much. This way, I can focus on other matters.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28053008": "Other matters?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28053009": "Like watching the kids and making sure the kids eat their bell peppers?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28053010": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28054001": "Good morning, Miss Joselyne. No morning prayers today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28054002": "The prayers are already over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28054003": "Now it's time for sword training.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28054004": "Want to join me, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28054005": "It's been a while since I've had a training partner.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28054006": "...I think I'll pass.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055001": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055002": "Hi Joselyne. You're up early again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055003": "The prayer this morning was earlier than usual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055004": "The first daybreak after a serene night can make us feel closer to the God of Light.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055005": "I shall now take a shower before practicing with my sword.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055006": "What about breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055007": "Breakfast? White Night up high, I've forgotten all about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055008": "Thank you for the reminder.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055009": "No problem. Remember, don't skip your meals and breaks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055010": "I know. It is a sin to be distracted by hunger or fatigue when praying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28055011": "White Night up high, that would be disastrous for me, PlayerName. I'm grateful again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056001": "Good morning. I've prayed for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056002": "Good morning. Thank you for always praying for me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056003": "You don't have to thank me. It's a part of what I do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056004": "The help you've given me is worth relating to the God of Light.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056005": "I have been crafting a lucky charm for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056006": "Lucky charm?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056007": "Sometimes, because of the people and children in Twilight...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056008": "I may not have the time to pray for you, and that will make me feel ashamed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056009": "Therefore, I hope a lucky charm will bring you the God of Light's blessings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056010": "You didn't have to do this...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28056011": "It's no trouble at all. White Night up high. May the mercy of god be with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061001": "PlayerName, there's something I'd like to ask you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061002": "What's up, Miss Joselyne?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061003": "Well, I saw yesterday's menu...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061004": "Our diet is seriously lacking in fruits and vegetables.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061005": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061006": "You know how things are these days...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061007": "As a result, the Colossus doesn't dock in town often.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061008": "When sourcing supplies, we need to take preservation into account.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061009": "I'm sorry. We shouldn't be picky eaters.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061010": "I'll make sure to set up a balanced menu!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061011": "I'll bring over some fresh vegetables later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061012": "And I'll personally watch everyone chow them down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28061013": "White Night up high! May everyone stay in good health!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062002": "Greetings, Miss Joselyne.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062003": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062004": "How about a walk after lunch? Wanna come along?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062005": "I'd like to see Twilight from Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062006": "Twilight is visible from here?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062007": "Yeah, it looks so tiny from here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062008": "I aspire to protect it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062009": "To protect this tiny haven for everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062010": "Joselyne...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28062011": "White Night up high! May we be blessed with the courage of the blazing sun.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063001": "Miss Joselyne, I've been trying to get in touch with you for a while.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063002": "Oh, PlayerName. What's up? You need me for something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063003": "Didn't see you during the meal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063004": "I got a little worried.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063005": "So this is what's going on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063006": "White Night up high! I appreciate your concern.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063007": "I'm just enjoying the sunlight here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063008": "Is this a form of prayer as well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063009": "Am I interrupting you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063010": "Don't concern yourselves with that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063011": "It's just... a personal hobby, I guess?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063012": "May all living beings on the earth feel this warmth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063013": "(Guess I should leave her alone now.)",
  "str_quest_chat01_28063014": "(I can bring lunch to her room later.)",
  "str_quest_chat01_28064001": "Good afternoon. May you be full of vigor today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28064002": "I do feel so energized today that I can work late into the night!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28064003": "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to compel you to keep working.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28064004": "Perhaps you should take a break now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28064005": "You're right. Do you usually take afternoon breaks?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28064006": "I do when I have the time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28064007": "But between prayers, sword practices, gardening and sewing, I don't have much free time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28064008": "However, it's rude to not follow what you preach.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28064009": "White Night up high, I'll enjoy the break with you today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28065001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28065002": "Which do you prefer between tomatoes and cucumbers?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28065003": "Tomatoes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28065004": "Tomatoes, you say... I like the sweet and sour taste too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28065005": "Cucumbers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28065006": "Cucumbers, you say... I like the refreshing crunch too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28065007": "I planted plenty of both to improve everyone's diet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28065008": "I'll pick a basket of your favorites as an appreciation for your constant help.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28065009": "Can I really have it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28065010": "Of course, the God of Light certainly approves of rewards to the pious.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081001": "Miss Joselyne?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081002": "It's getting late, and you're still not back in your room resting?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081003": "Yeah, just finished my bedtime prayer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081004": "You need to pray before sleep as well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081005": "Yeah, to summarize and reflect on the experiences of the day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081006": "To express gratitude to the God of Light for today's gains.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081007": "To pray for the dawn of the next day to come as usual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081008": "And, of course, there's something even more important...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081009": "Something more important?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081010": "To pray for everyone to have a peaceful sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28081011": "White Night up high. May you have sweet dreams tonight, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28082001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28082002": "Sorry for being rude, but I'm wondering what do you think of the \"Saintess\" title?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28082003": "It carries a lot of responsibilities.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28082004": "Responsibilities? Indeed, it's a burden I'm not able to fully bear...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28082005": "It sounds sacred.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28082006": "Sacred? Indeed, I'm not worthy enough to carry such sacred title.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28082007": "I'm just an ordinary girl and wish to be treated like one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28082008": "Nicknames like Tomato Girl or Young Seamstress are perhaps more fitting for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28082009": "Well, I think you should just be yourself on the Colossus, Joselyne. Don't put too much pressure on yourself!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28082010": "Thank you... PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28083001": "White Night up high. May you have sweet dreams tonight.",

  "str_quest_chat01_28083003": "Thank you. Your piety shall be rewarded.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28083004": "As long as we're sincere, the God of Light will surely bless our dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28083005": "Have you had any particularly memorable dreams?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28083006": "I've often dreamed that my fellows living in peace.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28083007": "On a land free of Eclipsites, laughing in joy under the sun.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28083008": "It was only a dream, but the God of Light will guide me toward that end.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28083009": "Now, for praying tomorrow in the optimal condition...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28083010": "Good night. The Light of God never leaves anyone behind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28101001": "I've got a great book recommendation for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28101002": "It's called History of the Continent, and the author is from Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28101003": "How great is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28101004": "This book dives deep into the composition and history of the continent...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28101005": "It covers the origins of the Aurorians, and it even includes some history of the Caelestites.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28101006": "But members of the True Order would probably scoff at this book, haha.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28101007": "Okay, I'll check it out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28101008": "Interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28101009": "I'll bring the book to your room in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102001": "Have you finished that book?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102002": "Yup.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102003": "It's quite interesting, for real.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102004": "The various factions on Astra see this world in their own unique ways.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102005": "Which can offer researchers some fresh angles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102006": "Huh? Wouldn't that create obstacles?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102007": "Histories written by ones from different backgrounds are bound to differ.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102008": "As a scholar, I won't judge who's right or wrong.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102009": "Cause they're all part of history.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102010": "At the end of the day, history is just a collection of how Aurorians see things.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102011": "What I aim to do is to keep exploring this continent with the questions in my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102012": "Until every question in my heart is answered.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102013": "Your thirst for knowledge is truly off the charts, Antony.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102014": "Speaking of which, PlayerName, I've got a lot of history books from various regions here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102015": "We can read them together when you have time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28102016": "Sure, no problem.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103001": "I've discovered something big.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103002": "Based on my calculations, there might be a meteor shower the day after tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103003": "That's going to be an exceptional astronomical spectacle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103004": "I need to start getting ready for it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103005": "Need a hand with that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103006": "No worries! I'm just super excited right now! All pumped up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103007": "You think you'll have time then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103008": "Wanna join me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103009": "I think I can make it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103010": "PlayerName, there's one more thing I'd like to ask you for a favor.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103011": "Can you make the Colossus... go a bit higher at that time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103012": "Get it closer to the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103013": "Right, I was thinking the same.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103014": "That's great! Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103015": "Alright, I'll go prepare!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28103016": "Don't forget about it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28104001": "Navigator, I'm currently analyzing Fireflies' activity data.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28104002": "Location: the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28104003": "Are you interested in coming to take a look?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28104004": "You're not doing anything strange to the Fireflies, are you?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28104005": "Why aren't you responding?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28104999": "I'm getting worried about the Fireflies. I should go check on them quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28141001": "Testing the signal; testing the signal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28141002": "Wow, it was actually sent out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28141003": "How on earth does it work?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28141004": "PlayerName, could you please tell me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28141005": "Take it easy, Antony.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28141006": "Ah... Sorry, got a bit carried away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28141007": "Antony, the folk scholar, officially takes residence in the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28141008": "Is this better now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28141009": "That's way too formal!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142001": "My knowledge reserves have grown again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142002": "You mean you've found more good books again?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142003": "It's not books this time; it's underground ruins.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142004": "The thing is, there are loads of Eclipsites in there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142005": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142006": "Don't worry; they weren't a threat to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142007": "Unfortunately, the Eclipsites disappeared too quickly for research.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142008": "You want to study Eclipsites?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142009": "Truth be told, I've always wondered about the origins and principles of these creatures...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142010": "Too bad there hasn't been the right opportunity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142011": "The good news is, I found a lot of good stuff in the underground ruins.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28142012": "Well, I'm heading back to assess their status now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143001": "Let's go on an adventure together today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143002": "Where are we going?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143003": "Well, there are underground ruins, small Eclipsite nests, deep valleys, and cliffs...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143004": "That sounds way too dangerous...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143005": "Is there an option not to go?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143006": "Do you find these places scary, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143007": "They're not as dangerous as you might think.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143008": "I've done my assessment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143009": "It's not often you get to go to these places.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143010": "Don't you want to be the first explorer there, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143011": "Haha, I'm more worried about becoming a trophy of the Eclipsites.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143012": "But seeing how excited you are, I decided to go with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28143013": "Let's meet at the entrance then!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144001": "I should head back to the Northland sometime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144002": "Is there something important?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144003": "I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144004": "You see, the Northland doesn't have the usual education infrastructure like elsewhere.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144005": "Over the past few years, I've explored and learned quite a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144006": "So, I plan to return to the Northland and impart my knowledge to the children there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144007": "That's a very meaningful thing to do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144008": "Can I join you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144009": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144010": "Even in the most remote villages, there are kids who thirst for knowledge of the outside world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144011": "They must be curious and yearning for the world outside.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28144012": "Just like I was when I was a kid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28151001": "PlayerName, are you up yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28151002": "Just got out of bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28151003": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28151004": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28151005": "I just found something, and I want to share it with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28151006": "I believe the most productive time for learning is in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28151007": "I managed to memorize the formulas I couldn't grasp last night!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28151008": "Oh, congrats! I'll give it a try sometime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28151009": "Hold on, I don't want to memorize Vice's nutritional mantra. Let me switch to something else...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28152001": "It's fascinating that on the Colossus, ones from different regions have entirely different morning routines.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28152002": "So that's what you've been observing, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28152003": "Yes, I've seen those Illumina soldiers doing their morning workouts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28152004": "And those from Lumopolis and the True Order—they pray in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28152005": "Although their ways of praying are quite different.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28152006": "So, what's your usual routine, Antony?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28152007": "I read or prepare tools for adventures.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28152008": "It depends on the plan I've for that day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153001": "Morning, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153002": "Your voice sounds rough. Did you have a rough night's sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153003": "Well... I didn't sleep at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153004": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153005": "I got my hands on a miraculous relic from the ruins yesterday...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153006": "So, I've been studying it the whole time...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153007": "Before I knew it, it was already dawn.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153008": "Don't forget to take breaks and get some rest, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153009": "You're quite a hard worker, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153010": "It's important to balance it with some rest, alright?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153011": "Sure, I'll keep that in mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28153012": "I need to catch up on some sleep... Got stuff lined up in the afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28154001": "I wanna ask you about something.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28154002": "Go ahead, ask away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28154003": "PlayerName, what's the first thing you do when you wake up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28154004": "Say hi to the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28154005": "Go back to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28154006": "I see. I should make a note of that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28154007": "This might help me gain more insight into Caelestite's customs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28154008": "But it's just a personal habit of mine, not representative.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28155001": "PlayerName, have you ever tried using books as a blanket...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28155002": "Sleeping with books for a cover.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28155003": "Is that a novel way to sleep or something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28155004": "There was a time when I was exploring in the wilderness, and my blanket got ruined.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28155005": "It was freezing that day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28155006": "So, I used a stack of books as a cover and had a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28155007": "Surprisingly, it was quite cozy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28155008": "Want to give it a shot?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28155009": "No, I'm good...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28156001": "Ah, it's already time to say good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28156002": "Did you not sleep well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28156003": "Not exactly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28156004": "Stayed up late again?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28156005": "Well, not quite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28156006": "The incredibly clear night sky made it easy for me to forget the time...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28156007": "Would you like breakfast then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28156008": "Breakfast? Thank you, PlayerName, but I'd like to review what I recorded last night in depth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28156009": "However, will a schedule like mine cause problems for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28156010": "Not at all, but you should still get your downtime and meals in...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157002": "Morning. You're up early today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157003": "Yes, I planned to spend a whole day in the archive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157004": "Therefore, I slept the entire night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157005": "A whole day in the archive?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157006": "Yes, and that might not be enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157007": "Occasionally, I still feel hopeless due to my own ignorance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157008": "Thus, I find it marvelous to absorb knowledge ravenously in the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157009": "I'm glad you like that! What information are you looking into today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157010": "Yet observation data would be lacking in that case...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157011": "Oops, I believe I just ignored what you said. Sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28157012": "It's okay, I got used to it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28161001": "I've noticed there are quite a few plants on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28161002": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28161003": "I was trying to introduce some natural vibes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28161004": "But from what I've seen, some of the plants are withering, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28161005": "Sigh, not sure why, but I just can't seem to keep them alive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28161006": "I'll go check them out in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28161007": "Things like soil, light, and watering, among others, can affect the growth of plants.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28161008": "You have quite a bit of knowledge in botany too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28161009": "I'll see what I can do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28161010": "Cool, Antony. I'm counting on you now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162010": "PlayerName, where are you right now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162011": "On the bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162012": "In the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162013": "I'm outside your room right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162014": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162015": "Nothing urgent; just wanted to borrow a few books from you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162016": "I knocked on the door just now and got no response, so I thought you were taking a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162017": "You didn't wait at the door the whole time, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162018": "Haha, I actually did.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162019": "Since you didn't come out after a long while, I shot you a message.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162020": "You can message me sooner next time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28162021": "I'll be back right away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163001": "It's time for my midday nap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163002": "I usually take a nap at noon to recharge for the afternoon's adventures, research, and learning activities.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163003": "How about you, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163004": "Still got a bunch of stuff to handle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163005": "That's exactly why you should take a break from all that stuff.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163006": "Otherwise, you'll burn out sooner or later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163007": "So why not catch a quick nap today? It might boost your afternoon productivity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163008": "Alright, I'll give it a shot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163009": "I was actually planning on it too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163010": "Cool, looks like we're on the same page.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28163011": "I'm gonna take a nap now. You should get some rest too, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28164001": "What do folks usually eat on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28164002": "Uh, there isn't a set menu or anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28164003": "How about you, Antony?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28164004": "Well, for me, it's mostly high-calorie, portable food.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28164005": "I'm always on the go, so I just need food to provide me with basic nutrition.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28164006": "Actually, I don't have any plans for today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28164007": "I'm kind of curious about what the kitchen here looks like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28164008": "It's actually quite ordinary...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28164009": "But if you're curious, feel free to go and take a look.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28164010": "Alright then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28165001": "Good afternoon. I have something I'd like to elaborate to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28165002": "Go ahead.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28165003": "I borrowed several books from the archive, which are due now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28165004": "But I have yet to fully comprehend them. Therefore, I'd like to keep them for a few more days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28165005": "Is that possible?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28165006": "Sure, you can keep them for another two weeks for all I care.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28165007": "No-no, I'll return them as soon as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28165008": "The books and knowledge in the archive belong to everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28165009": "It's very shameful to lionize them. I'm striving to not be so petty.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28165010": "Got it... Even though I don't think anyone's checked out those books for a long time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28166001": "Are you free? I'd like to show you my new discovery.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28166002": "Another one?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28166003": "I saw a nebula I'd never seen before last night. It was wondrous.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28166004": "I recorded it but the footage is only half-edited. Still, I can send you a preview.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28166005": "I'm ashamed to admit there's much more unknown than known at this point.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28166006": "Got it. I'll study it when I have time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28166007": "Please do not feel obligated. It is just my personal interest, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28166008": "It's quite alright. I'm interested in all your research.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28166009": "That is good to know. It is an honor to share my interest with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28166010": "Who knows, maybe we will have a transcendent discovery together one day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28181001": "PlayerName, the night sky tonight is truly spectacular.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28181002": "Wanna come out and take a look?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28181003": "I'm tied up with something else right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28181004": "I'll swing by later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28181005": "Alright, I'll use the terminal to give you some intro first.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28181006": "I'll tell you more details once you're here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28181007": "No, no, no...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28181008": "The terminal can't handle that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28181009": "I'm on my way, just wait up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28182001": "PlayerName, I'm going out tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28182002": "And I'll be back tomorrow morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28182003": "Huh? What are you up to?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28182004": "While flipping through some books, I stumbled upon a fascinating site of ruins.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28182005": "I wanna go see it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28182006": "Otherwise, I might toss and turn all night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28182007": "Alright...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28182008": "I bet I can't stop you even if I want to.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28182009": "Well, be careful then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183001": "One-two, testing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183002": "Roger that, loud and clear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183003": "Are you still up, PlayerName? I hope I'm not disturbing you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183004": "I'm just getting ready for bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183005": "Pardon me for disturbing you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183006": "Don't sweat it, I haven't gone to bed yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183007": "It's still early for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183008": "Is it? I thought you would be asleep by now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183009": "Anything I can help you with?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183010": "I'm preparing for tonight's exploration.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183011": "While there isn't any issue in general so far...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183012": "I hope I can reach you right away when something unexpected does happen.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28183013": "Stay safe, please!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28184001": "Hope tonight's observation will proceed without a hitch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28184002": "Observing again tonight?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28184003": "Yes. The sky tonight is simply begging to be observed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28184004": "I'd love to find the perfect spot for that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28184005": "Need help with that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28184006": "I appreciate the thought, but it's not necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28184007": "You have many things on your schedule every day, PlayerName. You should get a good rest at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28184008": "I'll share any marvelous discoveries with you later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28184009": "Cool, I can't wait.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201001": "PlayerName? I need to talk to you about something...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201002": "Is there anything I can do to help with the cleaning around here?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201003": "Huh? Why do you ask, all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201004": "Well, while everyone's so busy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201005": "I feel so awkward just standing around!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201006": "I know I just arrived here... But I don't want to be treated like too much of a guest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201007": "I'm really glad that you want to help, Zarya.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201008": "But the work has already been assigned, so there's really not much else to do around here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201009": "Err...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201010": "Wait, I have an idea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201011": "The others probably would feel a little warm while they're doing the cleaning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201012": "I can use my powers to keep everyone cool while they're working in the extra-hot areas of the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201013": "That sounds good to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201014": "You can make a difference just by standing around now. No need to feel awkward anymore!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201015": "Y-Y-You're just teasing me now, aren't you?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28201016": "Hmph! I'm off to get ready!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202001": "Uh... You know, I've already spent a considerable amount of time aboard the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202002": "Well? Have you gotten used to it yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202003": "How should I put this... Everything still feels so new, but it's also very comfortable here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202004": "At first, I was really nervous about coming aboard.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202005": "You should know, since...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202006": "I've never been good at making small talk, and I didn't have many friends as a child...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202007": "There were so many unfamiliar people here, and I was still getting used to my new powers...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202008": "There's also the matter of our age gap... Though to be honest, it's more like an age canyon!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202009": "The difference between our generations is so big...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202010": "Which is why I thought I would have a hard time adjusting to this place.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202011": "But my experiences so far couldn't be any more different!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202012": "Everyone here is so carefree, and they all have their own unique quirks. Getting to know them is so much fun!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202013": "I'm starting to see why everyone chooses to follow your leadership.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202014": "What? Really? You're not just messing with me, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202015": "It's a little hard for me to accept this kind of praise, but I'll do it just for you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202016": "You don't seem to be having a very hard time accepting it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202017": "Oh, I'm also making something special for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202018": "Oh really? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202019": "I-It's not ready yet... Also, it's a secret!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28202020": "Just be patient, you'll get it soon enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203001": "*Coughs*",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203002": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203003": "D-Did you get your gift?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203004": "I didn't get it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203005": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203006": "You didn't see it?! Could it be...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203007": "Just kidding! I got it, don't worry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203008": "Why, you——!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203009": "I did!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203010": "After all, you left it in a pretty obvious place.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203011": "Phew, that's good to hear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203012": "Do you think my craftsmanship has gotten any better?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203013": "Consider it a token of my appreciation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203014": "You know... For all that you've done for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203015": "An ice sculpture that will never melt... I can't think of a more appropriate gift than that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203016": "So this is what you've been working on lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203017": "It's wonderful! I can tell you put a lot of thought into this!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203018": "So what exactly is it? A crocodile, or maybe some sort of fairy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203019": "A crocodile? What kind of crocodile stands on two feet?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203020": "It's obviously an... Oh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203021": "It might've melted a little bit, after all...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203022": "I'm sorry. It looks like my skills aren't quite there yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203023": "...Let me make you a new one!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203024": "No need! I like this one just fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203025": "It's the thought behind a gift that counts, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203026": "And what could be better than someone's very first attempt?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203027": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28203028": "Thank you... Sniff... Waaaaaah!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28204001": "Are you there, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28204002": "I want to show you the results of my training.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28204003": "I'll be in the Lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28204999": "Zarya has been working hard under Vice's guidance to improve her aiming accuracy lately. Maybe I should go and see how she's doing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241001": "?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241002": "?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241003": "Huh? Is this how you send it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241004": "This thing is so hard to use...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241005": "Uh, PlayerName? It's me, Zarya!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241006": "Don't worry, I know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241007": "Still getting the hang of your terminal?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241008": "Yes... It's the first time I've ever used something like this, after all...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241009": "Sorry in advance if I make a lot of typing mistakes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241010": "Hopefully I don't send anything too embarrassing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241011": "Don't worry, I'll swing by later and show you the ropes!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241012": "I promise it's not as hard as it seems.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28241013": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28242001": "Are you heading out today, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28242002": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28242003": "We're getting close to our target location.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28242004": "Th-Then could I come along as your bodyguard?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28242005": "It feels as though I've gotten much stronger recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28242006": "I shouldn't have any trouble protecting you now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28242007": "Hahaha! You can just tell me if you want to go out, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28242008": "Th-That's not it at all! I'm honestly worried for your safety!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28242009": "Sure, I'd be glad to have you along.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28242010": "I'll come look for you in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243001": "I felt much better when I used my powers today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243002": "My strength and accuracy seem to have considerably improved.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243003": "Hopefully I'll be able to put them to better use soon!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243004": "Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243005": "Thanks, but I still have a long way to go.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243006": "Just keep doing your best!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243007": "D-Don't be so demanding...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243008": "I know this isn't the end of my journey. I still have a long way to go.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243009": "But for now, I think I'll go talk to Miss Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243010": "Maybe she can give me a few more advice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243011": "After all, she's such a skilled fighter, and she has a wealth of experience to rely on...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243012": "If anyone aboard the Colossus can teach me, it's her!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243013": "I just hope I won't be imposing on her too much...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243014": "Don't worry! Vice is super accommodating. She's always willing to help.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243015": "As long as you're polite and punctual, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243016": "By the way, have you considered asking Carleen for help?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28243017": "Uh... T-To be honest, I'm a little nervous about having someone like her as a teacher!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244001": "It's strange...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244002": "I spend most of my time in my room here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244003": "And even though we travel all over the world, we never stay in one place for too long.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244004": "Honestly, it doesn't feel all that different from when I was a child.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244005": "But somehow, I don't feel like I'm being locked up at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244006": "And I don't feel sad or useless all the time anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244007": "In fact, I've even made a few trustworthy friends here!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244008": "There must be something truly magical about this place.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244009": "You know, there is one other possibility...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244010": "Maybe you've just gotten stronger ever since you came here?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244011": "Does that mean... I've grown a lot since we knew each other?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244012": "Compared to my past self, I suppose I've gone through some major changes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244013": "Does this mean I'm strong enough to stand out as a skilled fighter?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244014": "I think so. At least you've definitely made a lot of progress towards that goal. I can promise you that much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244015": "I hope Miss Alina sees it too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28244016": "O... Okay!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28251001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28251002": "Hey, Zarya. You're up early...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28251003": "Well... I did just spend a hundred years sleeping in a block of ice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28251004": "Now I need to work hard to make up for all the lost time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28251005": "Otherwise, I'll never catch up to my sister.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28251006": "Remember to rest every now and then!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28251007": "Don't worry, you'll get there someday!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28251008": "Oh... Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28251009": "I-I should get started on my morning exercises, then!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252001": "Are you awake, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252002": "Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252003": "Huh? Then how are you replying to me?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252004": "Doing it in my sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252005": "What? I had no idea the outside world's technology had gotten so advanced!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252006": "Uh... I was just joking, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252007": "I just got up...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252008": "You did? Then why do you sound so tired, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252009": "I didn't sleep very well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252010": "It's still pretty early, but did you need something, Zarya?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252011": "I just wanted to see how you were doing. Looks like I was right to check on you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252012": "Here's an idea!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252013": "I can use your drinking water to make you some extra-cold ice cubes. They'll be as cold as -30°C!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252014": "That should perk you right up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28252015": "N-No thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253001": "Morning, PlayerName. Another busy day for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253002": "Yes, I'm pretty busy today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253003": "I see. You always buzz around like a bee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253004": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253005": "Oh? It's rare to hear you say that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253006": "Say, mind giving any communication-related task you might have to me to try out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253007": "Why are you interested in that all of a sudden, Zarya?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253008": "Well, I should do okay if it's only communicating and talking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253009": "Not to mention I'd like to reach out to the people in this era more.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253010": "I feel I might be able to make more friends I can depend on here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28253011": "Okay, I'll let you know when something comes up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28254001": "Good morning. It's warm here...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28254002": "Are you adjusting?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28254003": "More or less. The warm environment is very therapeutic...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28254004": "Glad to hear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28254005": "But I heard warm places have lots of caterpillars.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28254006": "Is that true?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28254007": "In theory, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28254008": "But there shouldn't be any on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28254009": "Phew... Understood. I'll keep my room clean.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28254010": "As will I keep the Colossus tidy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28261001": "Ahh... The afternoon sun is so warm and comfortable!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28261002": "Want to come out and enjoy the sunshine with me, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28261003": "Hello? Mr. PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28261004": "Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28262001": "Were you looking for me just now, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28262002": "Sorry, I was training and didn't see your message.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28262003": "Whoa, you're training in the middle of the day? Most people are taking a break around this time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28262004": "Hard work can compensate for a lack of skill, at least in most cases.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28262005": "Oh? So you're saying you're not very skilled, is that it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28262006": "Kidding, kidding! Just remember to get some rest every now and then, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28262007": "...Hmph! Like I need you to remind me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28262008": "I'm going back to my training. Talk to you later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263001": "I took a tour of the Colossus while everyone was taking their noon break.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263002": "Any thoughts you would like to share?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263003": "W-Well, I saw a lot of really new and unfamiliar things...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263004": "I asked Mr. Antony for help, but his explanations left me even more confused.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263005": "So I'm going to ask No. 33 for help, instead.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263006": "Why don't you ask me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263007": "I could explain things to you, too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263008": "But I would be bothering you on your break, wouldn't I?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263009": "That's okay, I'm just sitting around most of the time anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263010": "Then... C-Could you tell me what to do in case I accidentally freeze the Fireflies?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263011": "Should I take them to the Lumina Grid, or the... What was it called again?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263012": "The \"furnace\", I think...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28263013": "What?! My Fireflies!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28264001": "Have you been feeling unusually hot lately, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28264002": "Doesn't seem too hot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28264003": "That's strange... I've been sweating a lot lately...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28264004": "Is it because I'm still not used to this environment? Or maybe it's my clothes?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28264005": "Well, it's a bit hot...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28264006": "Oh good, then it's not just me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28264007": "I know! I'll go make myself a nice, refreshing drink. Would you like a glass, too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28264008": "That depends, will my mouth get frozen to the glass?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28264009": "... No!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28265001": "Are you there, PlayerName?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28265002": "Huh? What's going on? Are you okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28265003": "I... I got lost...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28265004": "Ah! I see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28265005": "Could you please help me? I think I locked myself in a room I'd never seen before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28265006": "Sure! Can you describe your surroundings to me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28265007": "Let me see... There are lots of pipes everywhere, and a huge machine in the center of the room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28265008": "Stay right where you are! I'm on my way!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28266001": "Um, PlayerName? Do these Rediesel stir-fried sandworms taste any good?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28266002": "Can't hurt to try.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28266003": "Don't worry, I doubt they'll make you sick or anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28266004": "They're great.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28266005": "They're one of my favorite snacks! Words can't describe how good they are!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28266006": "I see. Then I guess I'll try one...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28266007": "But if you're lying about the taste, I'm going to freeze your tongue.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267001": "Don't you think it's a little hot?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267002": "It is...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267003": "Somewhat borders on unbearable, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267004": "I think it's fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267005": "Is it? I guess I'm not used to the heat, coming from the Northland.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267006": "The hot, dry noon probably has everyone feeling sluggish, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267007": "Should I make something cool to drink for everybody on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267008": "Would you mind doing that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267009": "What are you getting at? I do try to chip in when I can, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267010": "I got this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28267011": "Cool, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268001": "Where are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268002": "In my room. What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268003": "It just seems you're always busy and hardly in your room ever, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268004": "Is this a good time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268005": "Of course. What can I do for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268006": "Can I call you even if I had nothing special?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268007": "Sure, we can talk about whatever's on your mind!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268008": "Well, it doesn't have to be about anything in particular.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268009": "I just don't like being alone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268010": "I feel at ease whenever you're around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28268011": "Don't worry, I'll always be around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28281001": "It's so late now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28281002": "You're not still awake, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28281003": "I’m going to bed right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28281004": "I’m just finishing up some work before bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28281005": "Just don't stay up too late, okay? Everyone needs to rest, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28281006": "Oh!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28281007": "I'm pretty sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28281008": "I think I'll go to bed now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28281009": "Hmm. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28282001": "My sister used to read me bedtime stories when I was little.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28282002": "It's been over a century, but I can still hear her voice echoing in my ears...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28282003": "Want me to call No. 33?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28282004": "I could read you one, if you like?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28282005": "N-No thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28282006": "I'm not a child, after all! I can sleep without a bedtime story!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28282007": "I... I'm going to bed now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28282008": "Alright then, good night!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28283001": "Did you leave this blanket in my bedroom, PlayerName...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28283002": "I heard it's going to be really cold tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28283003": "I just didn't want you to catch a cold.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28283004": "You don't need to worry about that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28283005": "Don't forget that I spent the last hundred years sleeping in ice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28283006": "No matter how cold it gets, it won't affect me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28283007": "But still... It was really nice of you to do that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28283008": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28284001": "The night falls really late here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28284002": "Yes, Northland gets dark early.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28284003": "Does it feel lonely at night in Northland?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28284004": "Lonely, hard to get by, but you could see the aurora.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28284005": "It's the kind of peaceful, tranquil beauty I wish you could see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28284006": "I'm very interested in that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28284007": "However, I have no idea when I'll be back in Northland.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28284008": "Compared to the past, I'd rather go on adventures with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28284009": "Let's go see the aurora if and when Soroz happens to drop by Northland.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28284010": "Sure, it will be my pleasure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285002": "The nightlife on Soroz seems to be fun...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285003": "Fun? What specifically?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285004": "I saw people gathered around to hit a ball back and forth with paddles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285005": "They were also playing fighting games on their terminals...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285006": "Everyone seems very happy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285007": "Would you like to learn to play, Zarya?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285008": "Me? It sounds like something you do with friends.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285009": "But as you know, I have hardly any friends in this era.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285010": "Everyone on the Colossus is your friend!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285011": "Really...? Ahem, a warm night like this is actually perfect for turning in early...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28285012": "Good night. May the Light protect you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301001": "I received gifts from both Miss Vice and Lady Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301002": "However, I am unsure as to what purpose they serve.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301003": "Oh! They probably brought you some souvenirs, didn't they?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301004": "They don't really have a specific use. People send them as gifts to make each other happy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301005": "\"Happy\"...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301006": "In other words, these items are used to improve relations between Aurorians?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301007": "By sending gifts to one another, Aurorians can also improve their respective moods. Is that correct?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301008": "Er, I guess that's one way of explaining it, yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301009": "Sending gifts can also be a great way to make new friends.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301010": "I bet everyone would love to get something from you, No. 33!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28301011": "Understood. Thank you for your explanation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302001": "Mr. PlayerName? Would you say that we are \"friends\"?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302002": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302003": "Why do you ask, all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302004": "Because I have prepared a gift for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302005": "However, I needed to verify whether or not I was qualified to give it to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302006": "Really? Thanks! What kind of gift is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302007": "A brand-new fitness device or an updated wake-up call service.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302008": "Which would you prefer?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302009": "I want both!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302010": "How very greedy of you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302011": "But as a friend, I will make an exception for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302012": "No need.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302013": "Just the thought... is more than enough to make me happy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302014": "You may also choose to receive both.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302015": "N-No thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302016": "Thank you for making your selection... No, what I truly wish to say is...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28302017": "Thank you for being my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28303001": "Pardon me, but do you have time to meet? I have an important matter that requires your assistance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28303002": "Sure, no problem.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28303003": "Thank you. I will be waiting for you in the Lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28303999": "Who would've thought that even No. 33, the all-powerful, augmented Aurorian, might find something knotty? Better check it out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28341001": "Modifications are complete.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28341002": "I am pleased to report that my upgrades were successful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28341003": "Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28341004": "Thank you. I will add these data updates to my schedule momentarily.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28341005": "You don't seem very different.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28341006": "The changes cannot be seen from my outer appearance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28341007": "I require a suitable testing ground immediately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28341008": "Once my upgraded functions have been properly assessed, I will employ them in battle as soon as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28342001": "May they prove useful for carrying out my new mission.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28342002": "Your \"new mission\"?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28342003": "Yes, when the old mission expires...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28342004": "For this reason, I have been constantly searching for a new mission.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28342005": "One that will help me find greater meaning, just as you said.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28342006": "I... I wish to continue with my purpose.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28342007": "I wish to continue protecting the world that Aurorians inhabit...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28342008": "And to see what they are capable of achieving with my own eyes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28342009": "I'm sure you'll see it someday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28342010": "We'll be with you until the very end, I promise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28351001": "The sun has risen again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28351002": "Please wake up at a reasonable hour.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28351003": "Please wake up at a reasonable hour. Please wake up at a reasonable hour. Please wake up at a reasonable hour.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28351004": "What are you, an alarm clock?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28351005": "Yes. Per Miss Vice's request, this is the current function I am performing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28352001": "Excuse me, but where may I find sanitation devices aboard the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28352002": "\"Sanitation devices\"? What are you trying to clean?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28352003": "My outer surface.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28352004": "Oh, then you must be looking for the bathroom!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28352005": "Wait, why do you want to take a bath all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28352006": "Other Aurorians aboard the Colossus explained the benefits of this custom.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28352007": "Evidently, a bath in the morning can help improve one's overall mood.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28352008": "I have not experienced this before, and wish to try it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353001": "Mr. PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353002": "I'm up. Affirmative statement.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353003": "Do not misunderstand. I am not here to awaken you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353004": "I only came to return the food you deposited at my doorstep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353005": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353006": "Someone else placed it here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353007": "I have videographic proof.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353008": "The person who delivered the food was none other than you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353009": "First, I would like to thank you for your consideration.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353010": "However, I do not require food to function.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28353011": "Furthermore, I have long since lost my memories regarding taste.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354001": "Greetings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354002": "Greetings, No. 33. Anything on your mind?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354003": "Work or a day off, which will you choose today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354004": "Work.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354005": "Based on your work schedule and downtime activity the previous day, work is definitely not the best option.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354006": "A day off.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354007": "Based on your work schedule today, a day off is definitely not the best option.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354008": "You should realize by now that either option alone is not the optimal answer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354009": "Only by integrating work with play can the goals be reached most effectively.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354010": "Thus, do you require The Perfect Plan for Today drafted by me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28354011": "I know how impressive you are already... Yes, send it over, please.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355001": "Good morning. Would you like to know the time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355002": "Oh, that's fine, I saw the time on the terminal when I picked it up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355003": "Understood. I see the timekeeping feature described in the memory bank is obsolete.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355004": "The feature is now designated for deletion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355005": "That's not necessary... Did I say something I shouldn't have again?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355006": "No. Updating data and information is crucial to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355007": "Do you have any new requests for mornings?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355008": "Well, nothing special comes to mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355009": "I shall then auto-switch to wake-up calls starting tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355010": "Based on your recent workload, your wake time shall be three hours earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28355011": "Can't you just leave me to sleep alone?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28361001": "Adequate rest is required to maintain peak functionality.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28361002": "A noon break from your duties is highly recommended.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28361003": "But you're always working non-stop, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28361004": "You and I are different.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28361005": "I do not get sick, and I age at a substantially slower rate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28361006": "But for other Aurorians, rest is essential.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28362001": "Good afternoon. I have updated a portion of your recipes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28362002": "Updated? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28362003": "I think my recipes were just fine before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28362004": "You do not agree that updates are necessary?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28362005": "In my opinion, updates are a fundamental process of our world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28362006": "Updates apply not only to technology, but Aurorians and nature in general.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28362007": "In any case, your new recipes have been optimized.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28362008": "Now, your nutritional requirements will be perfectly fulfilled.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28362009": "Uh, No. 33? I'm not a program or an animal, you know...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28363001": "Regular patrol complete.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28363002": "No dangerous personnel or suspicious objects detected.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28363003": "You don't have to patrol every single day, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28363004": "The Colossus is perfectly safe...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28363005": "Conducting regular patrols is essential to maintaining the safety and security of any fortified position.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28363006": "This is standard protocol for defensive applications as well as routine maintenance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28363007": "I will also conduct regular night patrols as part of my duties.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28363008": "Please enjoy your rest, PlayerName. I will protect the Colossus at all costs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28364001": "Good afternoon, I've updated the menu.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28364002": "Did you do that just for me? Thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28364003": "My pleasure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28364004": "Because you have reduced training time in favor of increased downtime, you have been placed in low-calorie diet mode.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28364005": "It is also necessary to implement restrictions on sugar and fat intake.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28364006": "Is that really necessary?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28364007": "Am I even going to make it through?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28364008": "Do not worry, the program will meet the minimal requirements for survival.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28364009": "You will return to the regular menu once you have resumed full training.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28364010": "Okay, I get it, I won't slack off again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28365001": "Good afternoon, I would like to request permission to update the data this afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28365002": "Alright. Anything you need my help with?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28365003": "I will be offline for four hours, during which time, please follow the schedule I have created for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28365004": "Or you can opt for a three-hour break until I have finished updating.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28365005": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28365006": "After updating, the new algorithm will present a better work plan.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28365007": "There is a high probability of saving considerable time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28365008": "Thus, it is logical for you to take a break during the process.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28365009": "Of course, you can also choose to stay nearby as a precaution against unforeseen complications in the meantime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28365010": "Got it, I'll pay attention to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28381001": "According to my observations, you have already exceeded your recommended caloric intake for the day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28381002": "A light and healthy dinner is strongly recommended.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28381003": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28381004": "A three-second hesitation has been detected.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28381005": "I have reason to suspect that you possess an intent of deception.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28381006": "Does it have to be healthy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28381007": "It appears forced correction is now required.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28381008": "I will arrive in your room momentarily.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28381009": "Applying my eyes of admonishment to your persuasion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28382001": "Arriving at the position outside the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28382002": "Wait, you weren't on board today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28382003": "It's quite late. Did something urgent come up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28382004": "The transition from day to night is an important facet of Aurorian life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28382005": "As I had not experienced it for myself in many years, I decided to conduct detailed observations on the phenomenon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28382006": "You're starting to sound a lot like Antony...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383001": "Are you asleep, Mr. PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383002": "Mr. PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383003": "I have sustained critical damage.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383004": "(Don't reply)",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383005": "...It appears you have truly gone to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383006": "(Reply)",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383007": "What?! Are you okay?!?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383008": "As I thought, you are still awake.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383009": "Looks like Mr. Sinsa's intimidation techniques are quite effective, as he taught me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383010": "Sinsa...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383011": "I have already emphasized this many times.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383012": "Extended periods of overexertion will cause irreparable damage to your body.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383013": "But I still need to plan out tomorrow's work.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383014": "Please deliver the materials to my room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383015": "I will prepare a suitable work plan and place it on your desk tomorrow morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383016": "Remember, I do not require sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383017": "Uh... Alright, then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383018": "After all, it's almost finished... Yaaaawn...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28383019": "Good night, and sweet dreams...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384001": "Good night. Now cueing up a lullaby.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384002": "Hold it, I'm not a child anymore. That won't be necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384003": "But it will greatly relieve you of the daily grind and improve the quality of sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384004": "Really? But you know that even though you don't need to sleep, No. 33?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384005": "Different from other Aurorians, I go into hibernation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384006": "But I specialize in assisting Aurorians to improve their sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384007": "Do you feel like hibernating when you hear lullabies?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384008": "They have no effect or cause any drowsiness to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384009": "Of course, if necessary, I can integrate that module into my database.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384010": "However, now is the time for you to go to sleep, so please do not digress.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28384011": "Okay, I'll go to sleep now. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28385001": "Excuse me, but are you in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28385002": "Not yet. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28385003": "It is time for you to turn in. I am merely reminding you of that fact.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28385004": "Based on my calculations, you will have a full day of challenging tasks tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28385005": "Thus, you must maintain your best focus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28385006": "Got it. I'll get to sleep right away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28385007": "However, I will be assisting you with work, thus you still have twenty minutes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28385008": "You should take this opportunity to grab a glass of warm milk and do some stretching.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28385009": "That will help you sleep better tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28385010": "Got it, I'll do that right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401001": "The sunrise is spectacular when seen from the clouds...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401002": "Don't stare too long or you'll hurt your eyes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401003": "Don't worry, I'm aware of basic medical facts like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401004": "It's just that I'd like to see some more of it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401005": "Is this your first time seeing sunrise?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401006": "Yes... First time in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401007": "Before, I'd watch sunrise quite often with my sister Isa and Eleanor.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401008": "The sunshine washing over me now is still warm...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401009": "But I probably won't ever feel how I felt back then again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401010": "Memories are precious, but they are precious because they only exist in your head.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401011": "Isn't that the truth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401012": "If we get a chance, will you watch sunrise with me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401013": "From the beginning to the end.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401014": "Absolutely.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28401015": "Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402001": "The high-noon sun is so bright...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402002": "And warm... So, so warm.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402003": "You rarely get the sun, don't you, Rebecca?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402004": "Correct.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402005": "Getting more sun is good for your health.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402006": "Back in Umbraton, sunbathing is a luxury.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402007": "Especially when I stayed in the underground clinic all day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402008": "Eleanor did all the going out for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402009": "But you're not in Umbraton anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402010": "Yes, I have finally made it out of there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402011": "Actually, I never thought I would be leaving Umbraton on a Colossus someday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402012": "Neither could I imagine what I'm feeling at this very moment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402013": "Thank you, PlayerName, for making a pact with me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402014": "It's all good, the accord goes both ways.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28402015": "And we shall never break our promises.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403001": "The sun has set...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403002": "It does leave me feeling a little down...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403003": "I don't care for the night very much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403004": "It reminds me of the days of not seeing the sun in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403005": "I'd imagine how wonderful it would be if the sun never set...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403006": "Then I didn't have to face the night again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403007": "You'll never have to face it alone anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403008": "You're right, I have friends now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403009": "This time, the glow won't vanish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403010": "We'll be with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403011": "Thank you for being willing to stand by me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403012": "Your words have calmed me down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28403013": "In return, please allow me to stand by you from now on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28404001": "I heard you were looking for me, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28404002": "I was out on business, so I wasn't in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28404003": "Let's meet in the lounge then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28404004": "There's something I have to talk to you about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28404005": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28404999": "Rebecca seems very tired lately. We must relieve her stress somehow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28441001": "Are we inside the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28441002": "It's very different from what I imagined...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28441003": "Are you settling into your new room?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28441004": "Yes, I'm very comfortable with it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28441005": "Thank you for what you did.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28441006": "I'm glad you like it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28441007": "Also, may I ask...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28441008": "May I be the resident physician?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28441009": "Even though I'm on the Colossus, I'd still like to help more people with my abilities...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28441010": "Sure, as long as you get enough rest and don't exhaust yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28442001": "Thank you for trusting me, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28442002": "Did my venom help?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28442003": "It was a big help.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28442004": "But you're feeling okay, right, Rebecca?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28442005": "I'm fine. It's not going to wreck me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28442006": "Not to mention I volunteered for the battle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28442007": "Be sure to tell me if you're feeling anything wrong.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28442008": "Yes, I got it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443001": "My Luminatics have improved recently...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443002": "Whether it's treating patients or fighting, I'm having a much easier time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443003": "Does that mean your condition is getting better?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443004": "I'm not sure about that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443005": "But when I see someone who's been suffering becomes wholly rejuvenated...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443006": "I feel everything I've done is worth it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443007": "That may be true...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443008": "But you shouldn't overexert yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443009": "I know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443010": "I'll take good care of myself too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28443011": "Don't you worry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444001": "I think about this a lot...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444002": "How wonderful it would be if my venom was lethal upon contact.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444003": "Then the bad people would get what they deserved.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444004": "And I wouldn't have to hear their painful howls again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444005": "You hate that kind of noises, do you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444006": "I don't think anyone likes it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444007": "The howls were both ear-piercing and terrifying... Every time I hear it now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444008": "It's as though I was reliving that very night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444009": "Too bad it's still beyond me to do that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444010": "Just take it easy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444011": "You're already powerful as it is.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444012": "Whether treating patients or fighting a battle.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28444013": "Protecting family is my duty.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451001": "Hope everything goes well today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451002": "Morning, Rebecca.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451003": "Do you want to grab breakfast with me in a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451004": "Sorry, but I have to drop by the clinic first.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451005": "I'm ashamed to admit I overslept this morning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451006": "I didn't expect you to make a mistake like that, Rebecca.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451007": "Eleanor was the one waking me up before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451008": "I see I'll have to get used to getting up on my own quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451009": "Oops, I didn't know. Sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451010": "No worries.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451011": "I have to go to the clinic now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451012": "If you see my sister, please let her know I'm over at the clinic.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451013": "She is probably still asleep...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28451014": "Okay, got it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452001": "Were you looking for me, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452002": "I just heard what sounded like someone knocking on my door...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452003": "Was that you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452004": "You're in, I see. It freaked me out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452005": "I was walking by when I heard odd noises coming from the room that sounded like... sobs?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452006": "I guess I couldn't get it past you, after all...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452007": "Are you ill, Rebecca?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452008": "Are you crying, Rebecca?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452009": "Sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452010": "To startle you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452011": "I'm fine... It's just a minor recurring issue.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452012": "I'll be okay in a minute.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28452013": "So there's nothing to worry about...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453001": "Hope everything goes well today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453002": "You got up very early today, Rebecca.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453003": "Have you had breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453004": "Not yet, I plan to tidy up the room first.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453005": "Don't you skip breakfast now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453006": "It is important to keep a room clean.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453007": "But don't you skip breakfast either.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453008": "Don't worry, I get three meals every day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453009": "Speaking of that, what do you usually have for breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453010": "You mean back in Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453011": "I was broke at the time...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453012": "So I never ate breakfast, basically.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453013": "It was pretty much just a slice of dark bread every day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453014": "Worry not, you can have as much as you want here, Rebecca.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28453015": "Thanks for the offer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28454001": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28454002": "Morning, Rebecca.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28454003": "Before I take off for the clinic, you're not feeling anything wrong, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28454004": "Me? I'm feeling well, had a nice sleep last night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28454005": "Okay, I can go to the clinic in peace then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28454006": "Now you just got me worrying...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28454007": "Relax, PlayerName, it's just a routine for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28454008": "You are important to me now, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28454009": "As a physician, I must monitor your health.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28454010": "I see... Thanks, Rebecca.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455001": "Good morning, hope you'll have a nice day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455002": "Morning, and you too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455003": "\"Nice\" would be a stretch in my case.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455004": "I'd be content with just a plain, uneventful day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455005": "But I get this feeling my sister is doing something behind my back lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455006": "Do you know anything about that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455007": "No, I don't.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455008": "She's busy with work, perhaps?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455009": "I see. If possible, would you keep an eye on my sister for me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455010": "She tends to overreact sometimes, so I hope you can help rein her in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28455011": "Got it, I will.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461001": "Think it's time for a break?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461002": "I'm on one now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461003": "Sorry to disturb you then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461004": "I can't afford to.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461005": "I got a big backlog of things to do...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461006": "I saw people practically working around the clock in Umbraton before...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461007": "What happened to them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461008": "I barely saved them with my Luminatics.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461009": "Thus, you must take breaks and naps.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461010": "Okay, will do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461011": "Have a nice dream then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28461012": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462001": "I heard you're not feeling too well, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462002": "I probably ate too much for lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462003": "I probably ate something bad for lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462004": "No worries.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462005": "I can treat you if you'd like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462006": "I just developed a solution specifically to address upset gastronomic issues.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462007": "Just one shot will solve the problem.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462008": "Is syringe shot the only way?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462009": "If needles scare you, I have other ways.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462010": "It's quite alright.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462011": "I feel much better just talking to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462012": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462013": "Is that true?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28462014": "Then feel free to come talk to me whenever you don't feel well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28463001": "What do you usually do on your afternoon break, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28463002": "Take a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28463003": "Take a walk.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28463004": "How about you, Rebecca?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28463005": "I picked up napping in the afternoon only after I came to the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28463006": "I would take an occasional walk with my sister as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28463007": "As for before this...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28463008": "I would stay in a secret lab and make venoms on my breaks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28463009": "Well, you don't have to do that now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28463010": "Yes, that is why I have to appreciate this hard-earned happiness...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28464001": "Will we land around here next time, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28464002": "It depends on the situation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28464003": "If we do, can I go off on my own for a while?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28464004": "Sure, but what are you planning to do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28464005": "I want to go shopping for things to decorate my room with.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28464006": "No problem!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28464007": "I've marked that down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465001": "Can you take a break now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465002": "Sure. Are you on break too, Rebecca?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465003": "Yes. Nothing much is going on in the clinic today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465004": "I promised my sister to go out with her this afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465005": "Ah, have a great time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465006": "With her... it will be.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465007": "I'm sure she'll take many pictures of you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465008": "Even you know about that now, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465009": "She said that it would help document my recovery.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465010": "Wait, she didn't show you all of the pictures, did she?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465011": "Don't worry, I won't look through them without your permission!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28465012": "Isa probably won't show them to me either...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28466001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28466002": "Afternoon, Rebecca. Did you grab lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28466003": "I did. And I even added some of the nutritional supplements I made.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28466004": "It wasn't bad in taste or result, but I still need to adjust the ratio.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28466005": "You can try it after I improve it, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28466006": "Nutritional supplement?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28466007": "Yes, I prescribed it for patients before... I think maybe the people on Soroz can use it too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28466008": "Though they might reject it out of the fear of the toxin inside me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28466009": "That's not true.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28466010": "When you're done, I'll be the first to try it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28481001": "It's almost nighttime, yet no one's come into the clinic.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28481002": "Isn't that a good thing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28481003": "Yes, no doctor would be happy about being busy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28481004": "I guess everybody's feeling fine and dandy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28481005": "Yes, something to be delighted about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28481006": "But having nothing to do actually makes me feel restless sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28481007": "Surely there are more people suffering from illness out in the world...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28481008": "When Soroz resupply next time, can I offer free treatment in the nearest settlement?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28481009": "Of course you can.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28481010": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482001": "It's almost time for bed, you should get some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482002": "True, it is getting late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482003": "Aren't you going to sleep yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482004": "If I remember correctly, you have house calls tomorrow, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482005": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482006": "But I'm having some trouble falling asleep right now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482007": "Don't tell me that you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482008": "It's okay, I'm not going through sad memories.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482009": "But the noise outside is getting to me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482010": "There's someone outside your door?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482011": "Yes, it's my sister.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482012": "She is concerned about my safety, so she wants to barge in again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482013": "Would you mind speaking to her, PlayerName...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482014": "Please.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28482015": "I got this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483001": "The evening breeze here is truly a comfort.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483002": "You're outside?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483003": "It's so cold.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483004": "It is a gentle cold that doesn't chill you to the bones.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483005": "I like it very much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483006": "Should I bring you some clothes?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483007": "I'm fine, thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483008": "It's late, so don't stay out too long.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483009": "Or you'll catch a cold.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483010": "I'll go back in a minute.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28483011": "Okay. Make sure you get some sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484001": "Can I borrow the fridge in the Rec Room, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484002": "The fridge? What are you doing with it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484003": "Ms. Sheol asked me to make some special venom.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484004": "The task is done but I have no place to store them, so I'd like to use the Rec Room fridge for the night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484005": "Never thought you'd accept a job like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484006": "Unfortunately, making money is necessary for a better life...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484007": "Do you have a lot?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484008": "Yes, a lot. She said she's using them as an ingredient for topical medicine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484009": "Of course, I made special provisions for the liquid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484010": "They'll lose toxicity if my formula for the topical medicine isn't followed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484011": "Then you must label them clearly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484012": "I know, I'll put a \"Do not touch without authorization\" sticker on them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28484013": "So nobody will touch them... right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485001": "It's dark outside...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485002": "Are you feeling afraid, Rebecca?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485003": "No, not when I'm inside the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485004": "But I do have mixed emotions right now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485005": "Why is that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485006": "Everyone on the Colossus looks so happy hanging out together. I wish I could be a part of that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485007": "But I'm afraid my toxin is going to hurt them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485008": "I don't think anybody minds!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485009": "As a doctor, I have to think of the worst scenario, so even if they don't mind, I can't risk it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485010": "On the other hand, this might make me look forward to being cured.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485011": "We're all waiting for the day you're cured!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485012": "Yes! Thank you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485013": "It's time to go to bed. You should turn in too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28485014": "Good night, and rest well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28486001": "Are you still up this late at night, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28486002": "I'm still awake. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28486003": "Well, despite not dreaming about my family being attacked as of late...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28486004": "I'm still a little leery about going to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28486005": "Is there any way to avoid having nightmares?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28486006": "Maybe thinking about wonderful things while in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28486007": "Wonderful things? Hmm, I do have many wonderful recent memories.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28486008": "Maybe thinking about the people you care about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28486009": "People I care about... Isa, and PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28486010": "Yes, I think I can fall asleep now... Zzz...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501001": "Sigh, I really don't get Rebecca...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501003": "I bought her a lot of things with the money I earned.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501004": "But she didn't seem happy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501005": "She would be giddy when I bought her cakes when she was little...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501006": "Maybe she had no need for them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501007": "What? I bought her tasty food, nice outfits, fun games, and you said she didn't need them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501008": "Well, what would you do if you were in my shoes, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501009": "Figure out what she likes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501010": "Surprise her.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501011": "I think I got it. I have to say, you're pretty sharp.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501012": "Let me give that a try.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28501013": "I'll be back for answers if I run into other problems.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502001": "I just started wondering what exactly is happiness?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502002": "After taking your advice, Rebecca seemed to smile more often.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502003": "But regardless, it can never match the ones from her childhood.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502004": "She was obviously so happy back then...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502005": "The relationship between you can't always be what it was before either.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502006": "I know that, but I still want her to be happy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502007": "You're a better thinker than I am, so tell me, what exactly is happiness?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502008": "That's hard to pin down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502009": "Have you ever felt true happiness?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502010": "When would you feel really happy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502011": "Well, I guess I was happy when Sheol freed me from the slave market.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502012": "Also when I'm with Rebecca...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502013": "Wait, I think I got it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502014": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502015": "Happiness is getting help when you're in trouble.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502016": "And being with someone you cared about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502017": "Nothing wrong with either of that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502018": "Come to think of it, that means I got happiness from you too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502019": "Shoot, I'm gonna say it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28502020": "We'll be pals till the end of time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28503001": "Hey, I got through. I have to talk to you about something, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28503002": "In exchange, I'll collect for you, free of charge!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28503003": "We can certainly talk.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28503004": "But nobody owes me any money...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28503005": "Well, that was just to break the ice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28503006": "Come see me in the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28503999": "What's so urgent to get you in such a rush?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541001": "I feel I've gotten better lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541002": "I resolved the situation just by talking when I went debt collecting yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541003": "I never thought you could do it without violence.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541004": "Me neither. It was weird.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541005": "As soon as the deadbeats saw me coming, they got on their knees.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541006": "And paid me in full with tears running down their cheeks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541007": "How come they were so terrified of you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541008": "You were that intimidating?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541009": "Well, it's probably because I hog-tied them together the last time I went to collect.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541010": "That must have traumatized them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541011": "That's brutal...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541012": "What's brutal about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541013": "They wouldn't pay if I didn't do that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541014": "The time before, and one more before that, I...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541015": "Stop, I'm too scared to find out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541016": "What do you have to be scared about? I'm only doing it to deadbeats.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28541017": "Anyway, be sure to let me know if you need anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542001": "I've been spending a lot more time with Rebecca lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542002": "Isn't that a good thing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542003": "Why, of course it is.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542004": "I believe Rebecca finally realized the benefits of having me around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542005": "I must get stronger to better protect Rebecca.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542006": "We'll talk about this later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542007": "I have to go train.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542008": "I'm off to collect in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542009": "Once I get the job done, I can buy a lot of things for Rebecca.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542010": "You're quite a busy bee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542011": "For Rebecca, it's all worth it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28542012": "Well, I give you my best regards.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551001": "You awake yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551002": "Didn't the day just break?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551003": "I got a very important task for you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551004": "Can you give me the specifics?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551005": "I wanted to make breakfast for Rebecca.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551006": "Problem is, I tried and tried but failed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551007": "So I broke the pan in anger.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551008": "You can't blame it on the pan!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551009": "I know, I know... I'll pay you back.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551010": "But for now, can you show me how to make breakfast, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551011": "I'm not very good at it either...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551012": "Hmm, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28551013": "I'll try someone else.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552001": "Hey, wanna have breakfast with me, The Great Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552002": "You have the time and patience for breakfast? Unbelievable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552003": "Speaking of which, I don't think I've seen you eat breakfast before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552004": "What are you trying to say?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552005": "Rebecca kept reminding me not to skip breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552006": "So how could I neglect her request?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552007": "However, I was quite busy with guild business...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552008": "So I basically just wolfed it down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552009": "What do you usually eat for breakfast then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552010": "Six toasts, three eggs and a bottle of milk.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552011": "Oh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552012": "Just got another side-hustle in.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552013": "We'll have breakfast next time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28552014": "Alright, take care.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553001": "Good morning, PlayerName. How did you sleep last night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553002": "Why don't we go hang out in the Rec Room?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553003": "Wanna try the boxing machine or the dancing game?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553004": "It's still early in the morning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553005": "How can you be so peppy...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553006": "I can't help it if I'm bored.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553007": "Ever since drinking Rebecca's concoction, I haven't slept in almost three days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553008": "She gave you something that potent?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553009": "Yes. She put it in the fridge, even had a sticker that said, \"Do not touch without authorization.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553010": "I'm her sister, so close enough to be considered authorized.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553011": "She obviously put it there for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553012": "You should ask her for the antidote.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28553013": "And you should do that now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554001": "Hello!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554002": "Hello, Isa. You look rather chirpy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554003": "Well, just got another gig today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554004": "I get to make side money and hang out at the same time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554005": "And probably rough up some lowlife deadbeats if I'm lucky!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554006": "Indeed, life is good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554007": "But be careful not to go overboard.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554008": "Relax, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554009": "I do what I get paid for, not one cent less or more.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554010": "But don't you tell Rebecca about this, got it?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28554011": "Worry not, I won't.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555001": "You awake? Time to get up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555002": "I'm up now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555003": "I wanna ask you something, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555004": "Yes?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555005": "That is, I want to go help Rebecca out as her assistant again today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555006": "But some patients said I'm mean.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555007": "I don't know where they got that idea! Haven't I always been a dependable big sis?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555008": "Did you treat patients like they owed something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555009": "You mean that's not the case? Don't they have to pay to get treated?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555010": "So how did you \"collect\" the payments?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555011": "\"Hey, you know what's going to happen with your health if you don't pay up, right?\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_28555012": "You probably should stop talking if you want the clinic to stay open...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561001": "My client gave me extra vouchers, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561002": "So I wanted to take Rebecca there for lunch today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561003": "Not a bad idea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561004": "What do you plan to order?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561005": "Don't jump the gun. She didn't want to go with me at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561006": "She said if we were alone, I'd do weird things around her!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561007": "How could she say that about her own sister?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561008": "Have I done anything weird around her before?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561009": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561010": "Other than sipping her drink behind her back, doing her laundry without her knowing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561011": "Following her in secret to make sure she's safe...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28561012": "Are you done?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28562001": "Got anything to eat over there, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28562002": "I got back too late and missed dinner. I'm starved.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28562003": "What were you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28562004": "Working, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28562005": "The deadbeat this time was special, like the deadbeat of all deadbeats.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28562006": "He tried to lock me in a safe and bury it in the ground...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28562007": "But I still got him in the end.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28562008": "I'm just wondering how you survived that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28562009": "You are simply unbelievable!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28562010": "What, isn't that in every debt collector's job description?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28563001": "Are you busy, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28563002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28563003": "Come have afternoon tea with us.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28563004": "Rebecca's there too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28563005": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28563006": "How can I leave my adorable little sister alone?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28563007": "So, you coming?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28563008": "I'd love to, but I got stuff to do...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28563009": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28563010": "Another time then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564001": "Why don't you slack off a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564002": "Sure thing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564003": "Hey, you do get it, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564004": "That's not a good idea...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564005": "What's bad about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564006": "How are we going to work in the afternoon without a break?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564007": "So let's talk about Rebecca!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564008": "Any news on her?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564009": "I got the money to pay for anything juicy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564010": "Aren't you with her day in and day out? Why do you think I got anything special on her?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28564011": "That's not fun! Go back to your lunch break then. Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565001": "Afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565002": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565003": "Say, got sturdier ropes on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565004": "We do, but what do you need it for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565005": "Got a deadbeat hanging out around here so I gotta go serve up a friendly reminder.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565006": "You need a sturdy rope for a \"friendly\" reminder?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565007": "Aha, you don't get it now, do you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565008": "I'm gonna play a game called Tangled Cord with the person.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565009": "Everyone who's ever played it ultimately coughed up what they owed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565010": "Although learning to hogtie...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565011": "Oh, I mean, tangle the cord is rather difficult.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565012": "Did you just say hogtie...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28565013": "Ahem... Sometimes, the less you know, the better.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28581001": "It's nighttime already before I know it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28581002": "I have to get ready.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28581003": "Get ready for what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28581004": "It's on Rebecca's behalf, naturally.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28581005": "You're not doing anything suspicious again, are you...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28581006": "The temperature's dropping and I just want to give her clothes to keep her warm.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28581007": "It's rare you actually behave like a normal sister would.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28581008": "What kind of person do you think I am...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28581009": "I'm responsible for how Rebecca dresses too, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28581010": "And she should dress like a girl sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582001": "Do you need a loan, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582002": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582003": "I'm asking you if you need a loan.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582004": "Why this out of the blue?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582005": "I got a gig as a loan officer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582006": "But not one person came for a loan all day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582007": "So... You need an urgent loan, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582008": "I don't take out loans.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582009": "Why not? Are you worried that you can't pay it back?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582010": "Does that mean you would give me a loan without having to pay back?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582011": "No, but we're good enough friends that I'll go quick and easy on you when I collect.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28582012": "It's okay, I don't need any loan!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583001": "I'm still up. What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583002": "Anything I can do for you, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583003": "It doesn't matter if it's cleaning, cooking, collecting debt, or roughing someone up...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583004": "I can do any of that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583005": "Well, I don't have any assignments for you right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583006": "Drat, guess I won't be making any money then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583007": "You were going to charge me?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583008": "Of course! No such thing as a free lunch, you know, just like no free task for Isa.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583009": "Speaking of that, why do you want to make so much money?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583010": "To live a happy life, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583011": "With money, Rebecca can enjoy better days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583012": "That's easy to figure out, I would think.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583013": "Anyway, remember to call if you got a job for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28583014": "We're close enough now for me to give you a discount.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584001": "I still can't sleep! Are you in bed yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584003": "Perfect. I wanna know if anyone on Soroz...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584004": "... is owed money lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584005": "Don't you think that's confidential?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584006": "Come on, don't be like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584007": "Why don't you borrow money from someone, PlayerName? Vice or anyone else will do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584008": "Then maybe I'll get a new client.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584009": "Are you trying to collect from me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584010": "Well, to be honest, I don't really wanna beat you up... Never mind then. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28584011": "But that means that thought did cross your mind...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28585001": "Wanna hear a collection story this late at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28585002": "Why this time of night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28585003": "Why a collection story?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28585004": "Don't you think it's fitting?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28585005": "Exciting, thrilling, even with a dash of horror.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28585006": "Guaranteed to keep you up all night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28585007": "So the goal is to stop me from sleeping...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28585008": "Well, since I've kept you up this late already, PlayerName, maybe...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28585009": "You'll slip and tell me secrets Rebecca might be hiding, yes?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28585010": "Not a chance! Now go to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601001": "Your Colossus is a work of art.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601002": "I'm flattered.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601003": "That's not my intent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601004": "I've seen many famous creations in my time, including ancient relics in the capital.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601005": "But Soroz is giving me an entirely special vibe.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601006": "Maybe they all have their own unique traits?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601007": "I agree, but...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601008": "Maybe the design of Colossus feels novel to you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601009": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601010": "Even though Soroz is completely different from Ye gadgets, that's not what intrigues me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601011": "I think the Colossus might have a special purpose.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601012": "It's alive: not only does it have a personality, but it was also bestowed something by its creators...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601013": "Impressive that you could see it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601014": "Indeed, Soroz is family to me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601015": "I can relate, since I know a few artisans who treated their favorite instruments like family!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601016": "But it's different with you and the Colossus is truly sentient.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601017": "I hope you all can be friends with Soroz too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28601018": "Wouldn't that be wonderful, PlayerName? It seems we're on the same page.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602001": "Got something to ask you, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602002": "Did Caelestites really build Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602003": "Why the abrupt question?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602004": "I looked into the archive on Soroz recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602005": "So to get an understanding of the Caelestite culture...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602006": "I'm curious why the peace-loving Caelestites would build colossi.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602007": "That doesn't contradict our principles at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602008": "It was to protect ourselves.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602009": "Indeed, arming yourselves isn't the same as using them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602010": "In Longzhou, the best blacksmiths I know are basically mild-mannered too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602011": "So you knew the answer all along?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602012": "Well, I just wanted to hear it coming out of you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602013": "I'm a proponent of the \"universal love and peace\" principle too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28602014": "I see we do get along like two peas in a pod!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603001": "Interested in visiting my school, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603002": "What brought that up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603003": "Aren't we close friends?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603004": "What's wrong with visiting each other's home?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603005": "That's true...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603006": "Of course, the ulterior motive is I get to go back.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603007": "But if I just show up like this, my junior schoolmates are gonna get on my case again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603008": "Why would they do that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603009": "Well, I'm not clear on that either.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603010": "Is it because you didn't get along with them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603011": "Not exactly, it's just...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603012": "Every time I went back, they'd pick on me for returning alone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603013": "They'd comment on how I came back after all this time still with only the same parasol in tow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603014": "I don't get why they're triggered by that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603015": "But if you come with me, that will shut them up, won't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603016": "I think what they meant by that is...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603017": "Anyway, that's the plan!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603018": "When we both have time, let's go to the Ye Kingdom and meet my fellows.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28603019": "I'm very much looking forward to it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28604001": "Remember the Illumina scientist you introduced me to last time, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28604002": "We finally had dinner and an awesome discussion!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28604003": "I should figure out a way to really thank you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28604004": "It's alright. Glad to see you two had a great time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28604005": "No, I must do something nice to repay you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28604006": "See you in the lounge!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28604999": "I should go see Xuan Ji now. Can't keep her waiting too long.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28641001": "Hey, thanks a lot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28641002": "I never imagined I would be on this Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28641003": "No problem! How's the terminal working out for you? I figured you would be interested in that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28641004": "Well, to tell you the truth, if I didn't have to use it to send you messages...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28641005": "I would've taken it apart to see how it works.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28641006": "I don't mind that if you can put it back together later...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28641007": "Heh, just kidding. We still got a lot to talk about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28641008": "Don't...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28641009": "I'm not gonna do that! But I'd like to be in on the repair if it breaks down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28641010": "Anyway, thanks. You really do understand where my interests lie.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28642001": "The archive is huge on the Colossus, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28642002": "Have you visited it already?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28642003": "Yes. Normally, to store knowledge of this scale would require an entire building.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28642004": "Not only do you have books here, but something even more convenient...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28642005": "I'm glad you found it helpful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28642006": "Of course, and even more than you realize! All the wisdom will be very beneficial to my modifications.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28642007": "I'm itching to get started already!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28642008": "In the battles awaiting ahead, I believe my gadgets will have a greater impact.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28642009": "Keep your eyes peeled for the show!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643001": "Have you ever had an epiphany before, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643002": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643003": "Then you definitely know how I'm feeling right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643004": "Never.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643005": "Too bad. It hit you like a hammer, yet you don't want it to stop.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643006": "Just a moment ago, I figured it out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643007": "Figured what out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643008": "Figured out how to make my gadget work better.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643009": "Simply put, I realized a way to make my clockwork bird sing louder.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643010": "Make my clockwork puppet move faster.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643011": "And make my Peculiar Parasol hit harder.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643012": "I didn't think it was possible to have it hit harder...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643013": "I didn't hurt you by accident before, did I?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643014": "No. It's just the image I get in my head of you bashing someone with your parasol.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28643015": "Do I look cool doing it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644001": "Guess what I found in Twin Pavilions Bay, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644002": "What did you find?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644003": "Don't keep me hanging.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644004": "An ancient relic from Longzhou.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644005": "I bought it at a market outside the town. It was caught in a fisherman's net.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644006": "Maybe when the city was first built, someone from Longzhou brought their heirloom...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644007": "And immigrated on the ship over here to start a new life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644008": "Before the ship wrecked?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644009": "Probably. But it's back in the hands of Longzhou as fate would have it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644010": "The relic is very small though, probably not for activating gadgets.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644011": "But I'm experienced enough to figure it out once I'm done examining it up close.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644012": "I'm grateful for this twist of fate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28644013": "For giving me the chance to acquire a piece of history and improve my skills at the same time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651001": "Morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651002": "Good morning, Xuan Ji. Did you sleep well last night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651003": "What sleep? Stayed up all night!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651004": "Still not used to living here?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651005": "To me, it's not about getting used but whether it's new to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651006": "You didn't spend the night checking out Soroz, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651007": "You figured that out...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651008": "The intricate design of the Colossus is mesmerizing. I've never seen anything like it in the Ye Kingdom before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651009": "But not to worry, I'm still only observing the form and framework right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651010": "It shouldn't affect Soroz in any way at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651011": "I'll be sure to let you know before I make a move!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28651012": "Letting me know and getting my permission are still two different things!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652001": "Want a cup of hot morning tea, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652002": "There's a saying in Longzhou, \"Three cups of tea in the morning keep the doctors away.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652003": "That sounds good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652004": "Let me brew some for you using my latest design, then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652005": "Why are you offering tea out of the blue?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652006": "Well, that's because I invented a new gadget.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652007": "I call it Emerald Delight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652008": "Just put the ingredients in and it will make excellent tea.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652009": "I would like you to be the first to try it out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652010": "My pleasure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652011": "Then come over quickly... Hold on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28652012": "How come the clockwork bird got its head stuck in it...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653001": "You like music, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653002": "Um... Why do you ask?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653003": "I tested out a few new voice-transmitting clockwork birds last night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653004": "I'm very happy with how they turned out; even added a mimicry feature.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653005": "Any one of them could repeat any song after hearing it once.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653006": "So I want to record some Astra music. Any suggestions?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653007": "How about hard rock?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653008": "That's pretty intense... The grandmaster won't like it, though I'm cool with it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653009": "Soft music should probably be preferable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653010": "You're right, elegant music is a better fit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28653011": "I'll get one to replay it once I'm done recording.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661001": "I've not been into eating lately...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661002": "Not a fan of the food on Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661003": "I wouldn't say that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661004": "No appetite?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661005": "I guess you could say that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661006": "The lunch from the cafe is perfect.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661007": "But I still feel something's missing after all this time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661008": "What's missing? Maybe I can add new items to the menu.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661009": "On second thought, maybe no improvement is needed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661010": "I'm probably just missing the street food in Longzhou.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661011": "For convenience, sometimes, I'd hit the stalls and eat it on the go.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661012": "Maybe I should make time to drop by sometime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28661013": "I can take you along too if you're free!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28662001": "Have you seen my mechanical puppet, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28662002": "You mean the servant bot you built?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28662003": "Yes. You know where it ran off to?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28662004": "I sent it to get breakfast, but it's noon now, and it's still not back.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28662005": "Is this the first time you sent it to get food?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28662006": "Yes. It usually does the cleaning for me and hardly leaves the room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28662007": "Malfunctioned, perhaps?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28662008": "Shouldn't have... I do regular maintenance on it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28662009": "Wait, maybe that's the reason!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28662010": "I gotta find it as soon as I can so it won't make trouble for you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663001": "Any plans for later, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663002": "Nothing in particular, no.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663003": "I haven't decided how to spend the time yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663004": "Oh, so that means you're free to do whatever?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663005": "In that case, can you lend me a hand?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663006": "I got an interesting idea looking at the food in my bowl.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663007": "What is that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663008": "I want to make something that would make the soup... Wait, I just changed my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663009": "I was gonna have you build it with me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663010": "But now I'd like to keep it a secret for the time being.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663011": "It will be more fun to have everyone try it out when I have a prototype ready.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28663012": "Well then, gotta run.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664001": "Interesting, very interesting...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664002": "What's interesting?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664003": "I saw a bunch of guys discussing over a dining table.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664004": "It sounded like they were talking about gadgets, so I listened in.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664005": "They drafted a blueprint out of beans and noodles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664006": "It was crude, but the design was interestingly intricate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664007": "Who do you think they are?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664008": "I didn't drop by, but I could tell they were from the desert in the south.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664009": "They wouldn't happen to be the Rediesel Wrench guys, would they?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664010": "Ah, I see, so they are the fellows from Rediesel Wrench I've heard so much about!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28664011": "I'll join the discussion for sure the next chance I get.",

  "str_quest_chat01_28681002": "I'd love to get some of that pick-me-up drink that's popular in Astra.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28681003": "Em... You mean coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28681004": "Yes, that's it, coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28681005": "Won't drinking coffee this late in the evening keep you up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28681006": "I'm fine, planning to stay up anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28681007": "Inspiration just hit me and I got a fun design in mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28681008": "So I wanna strike while the iron's hot and build it tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28681009": "Don't stretch yourself too thin.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28681010": "Relax. I won't.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682001": "Any good artist on Soroz, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682002": "Yes, but not sure if they fit your needs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682003": "I see. But I do need an artist.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682004": "I thought you could draw.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682005": "I could draft blueprints for my designs, but only doodle when it came to real art.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682006": "I noticed a moment ago how bright and shiny the night sky is.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682007": "Then I got this crazy idea to put a constellation chart on my parasol.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682008": "But for the life of me, I couldn't get it to look how I wanted.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682009": "Guess I needed a professional, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682010": "Princess Dantang should be able to draw.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28682011": "Forget it then. I don't want to get chewed out by her again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28683001": "The sky is getting dark again soon... Sigh.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28683002": "Doesn't it get dark every day? Why are you bummed about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28683003": "That's true, it's just I still have a lot of things to do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28683004": "I haven't tweaked my gadgets, drafted new blueprints, or moon gazed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28683005": "Haven't watched the shows I wanted, or checked out the night markets for street food.",

  "str_quest_chat01_28684001": "Have you tried polyphasic sleep, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28684002": "That's new to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28684003": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28684004": "Simply put, don't sleep all at once; split it up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28684005": "Sleep for one hour, work for two, then sleep for another hour.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28684006": "What good will that do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28684007": "We need at least four hours of sleep every day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28684008": "I read about it in an Astra book, saying this method can increase waking time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28684009": "I plan to try it. Hope I don't oversleep, though.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701001": "H-Hey, c-could you tell me how to make friends?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701002": "Well, you could try finding something in common, like a hobby.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701003": "A common hobby, huh... D-Do you know any other people who like art and antiques like me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701004": "Why do you ask all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701005": "Well, Lady Sheol asked me to introduce some antiques to a customer earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701006": "But the customer looked really scary, and I got so nervous that I froze up...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701007": "So I ended up ruining a deal for her...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701008": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701009": "Lady Sheol says I need to work harder to make friends and improve my social skills.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701010": "*sniffle* But I'm really not good at talking to other people...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701011": "It's not like I don't have any friends, but...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701012": "Wh-What should I do? Do you think she'll fire me if I don't make more friends...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701013": "Go make some right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701014": "I-I guess that's my only option now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701015": "I don't think so.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701016": "I see... But I should still try my best!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28701017": "I-I just need to calm my nerves with some candy first, and maybe a little cake.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702001": "I don't think I can do it, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702002": "Still having trouble making friends?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702003": "A lot of trouble... It's so scary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702004": "Even though I'm trying my best to talk to everyone on Soroz...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702005": "As soon as I open my mouth to speak, I start stammering uncontrollably.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702006": "You're way too nervous.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702007": "How can I help you...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702008": "*sob* If only there was a way to keep me from being so nervous!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702009": "You know, I hear some actors get over their stage fright by imagining that everyone in the audience is a head of cabbage.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702010": "C-Cabbage?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702011": "Yep, so why don't you give it a shot? Go ahead, picture me as a big head of cabbage!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702012": "H-Hello, M-Mr. C-Cabbage... Ugh, it's still no good!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702013": "Then what about antiques instead? You say you make friends with those, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702014": "A... Antiques?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702015": "Hey, you're right! When I picture you as an antique, I don't feel as nervous as before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702016": "What an incredible solution!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702017": "Thanks so much, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702018": "Though now that I think of it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28702019": "Whenever I talk to you, I don't stammer as much as I usually do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28703001": "PlayerName, um... I have a request...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28703002": "Can... can you go to the antique fair in Umbraton with me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28703003": "Of course I can, but I don't know anything about antiques.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28703004": "Well... um, er...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28703005": "Well, it can't be helped. I wanted to see what it's like too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28703006": "Really?! Thank you! I'll wait for you in the Rec Room!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28703999": "Go to the antique fair of Umbraton with Vergil!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741001": "Boo-hoo... The counterfeiters have been getting out of control lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741002": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741003": "Lady Sheol recently received a lot of antiques as gifts. The people who gave them to her spent a lot on them too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741004": "But a bunch of them are nothing but forgeries!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741005": "And judging from the techniques used to make them, I'd say these forgeries came out of Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741006": "You can even tell where a forgery is made?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741007": "Heheh, I've learned a lot from following you around all this time. My appraising skills seem to have gotten sharper too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741008": "So, should we report them since they're fake goods?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741009": "R... Report them? But wouldn't that involve talking to strangers?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741010": "I-I-I suddenly feel really hungry! W-We'll talk about it after I get something to eat...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741011": "Oh no...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741012": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741013": "*sob* My favorite tea and snacks all come from Lumopolis too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28741014": "I just hope I haven't eaten anything fake...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742001": "Check it out! I just switched to a bigger, newer magnifying glass!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742002": "What about your old one?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742003": "I put my old one away for safekeeping, heheh.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742004": "A magnifying glass?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742005": "That's right. It's one of the most important tools an appraiser can have!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742006": "But... there are lots of professionals who refuse to advocate their use.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742007": "They think magnifying glasses will only point their focus in the wrong direction.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742008": "Huh... That's completely different from what I had imagined.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742009": "But don't you always use a magnifying glass?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742010": "I do, but mine is different... I can also use it to boost my Luminatics!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742011": "In that respect, there are only a few appraisers in our field who can do that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742012": "Even though we use these tools differently, or sometimes not at all...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742013": "The most basic things we need are sharp eyes and extensive knowledge. Without either of those, we can never be professional appraisers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742014": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28742015": "Either way. I'm sure my magnifying glass has plenty of other amazing uses too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751001": "H-Hey, uh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751002": "Is something the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751003": "N-No, it's just...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751004": "Do you have something to tell me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751005": "I-I wouldn't say that, exactly...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751006": "G-Good morning!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751007": "Phew, I finally said it... Ah, I almost couldn't breathe.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751008": "Lady Sheol says I need to greet people more often. This is exhausting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751009": "You're doing really well now, Vergil!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751010": "I-It's not that amazing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28751011": "But... Thanks, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28752001": "Phew—f-finally, I'm done with the job Lady Sheol gave me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28752002": "What's for dinner tonight, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28752003": "Dinner? Don't you mean breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28752004": "What do you mean? It's still morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28752005": "It's morning?! B-But I just...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28752006": "You didn't spend all night in the warehouse without realizing it, did you...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28752007": "It sure looks like it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28752008": "Uwaah, morning again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28752009": "Lady Sheol's gonna scold me for overdoing it again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28752010": "I gotta go back!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761001": "Good afternoon! T-That's all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761002": "Good afternoon! Need anything?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761003": "I-I just wanted to ask about today's lunch. Are we having anything sweet to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761004": "Yes, actually. Today's lunch comes with cake.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761005": "Ah, I thought I smelled a creamy and delicious aroma...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761006": "U-Um, if I pass on the main dishes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761007": "Could I please have a little more cake?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761008": "You can have a little more cake if you want, but you shouldn't pass on the food.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761009": "R-Really? Aw, you're the best!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761010": "We don't tolerate picky eaters around here!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761011": "I-I-I'm sorry! I-I'll make sure to eat all my food!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761012": "P-Please don't be mad at me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761013": "You can't just eat sweets and nothing else.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28761014": "I understand!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781001": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781002": "Is the moon visible outside?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781003": "I can't really tell from inside the warehouse...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781004": "I'll go take a look in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781005": "O-Oh, then don't worry about it. I'll go see for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781006": "You know...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781007": "I found some pretty interesting artifacts in the warehouse earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781008": "Oh really? What about them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781009": "Well, they seem to match the description of a set of lost masterpieces, according to some ancient records.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781010": "They say these masterpieces will reveal hidden patterns when held under the moon's light.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781011": "So I wanted to try it out for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781012": "Sounds like pretty interesting!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781013": "Right? Also, I'm a hundred percent certain these were made a really long time ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28781014": "Oooh, I can't wait... In fact, I'm gonna go check them right now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782001": "H-Hey, do you have any tricks for falling asleep faster?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782002": "Falling asleep faster?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782003": "Y-Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782004": "During my last physical exam for the Cloudrover Guild... The doctor really told me off...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782005": "He got really mad when he found out I didn't have a set sleep schedule.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782006": "He said it was the reason behind my short stature too...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782007": "*sniffle* Is that really the case...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782008": "Uh... Did the doctor say anything else?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782009": "Hmm... Yes, he said that it shouldn't be too bad, since I'm still pretty young.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782010": "But my body won't be able to keep up at this rate, so I have to adjust my habits right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782011": "I just don't wanna get yelled at by the doctor again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782012": "Then go lie down and get some sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28782013": "Okay... I just hope I can get to sleep. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783001": "Hey, PlayerName, do you have any adhesive bandages?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783002": "There should be some in the infirmary. Is everything okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783003": "Are you hurt?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783004": "I-It's just a scratch, don't worry about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783005": "A really fragile antique nearly fell in the warehouse earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783006": "Thankfully, I happened to catch it in time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783007": "It would have been so tragic if it broke!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783008": "You should still go to the infirmary and get it looked at.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783009": "I-Infirmary? B-But I don't know where that is...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783010": "Besides, wouldn't I be bothering them if I showed up at this hour?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783011": "Then just wait for me, and I'll take you there myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783012": "N-N-No, no thanks! I-I found a bandage over here!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28783013": "You just get some sleep, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784001": "My ice cream...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784002": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784003": "Boo-hoo...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784004": "Lady Sheol wanted to give me a reward for helping her last time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784005": "So she bought me a super-expensive ice cream!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784006": "I brought it to the warehouse so I could eat it later...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784007": "But I got so caught up with my appraising that I lost track of the time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784008": "And so it melted...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784009": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784010": "We have ice cream in the Rec Room if you still want some, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784011": "R-Really? You really are the best!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28784012": "I'll go get some right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801001": "Of the many people who have seen the man known as \"Istvan,\" you are special.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801002": "I will always cherish our friendship.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801003": "The feeling is mutual, so... thanks?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801004": "If that's the case, why not join me for another chess game?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801005": "I won't hold anything back, as that would mean I don't see you as a worthy opponent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801006": "But I promise it will help you improve.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801007": "You say that, but it'll take years before I'm on your level.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801008": "Acquiring chess skills over the years is perfectly normal, wouldn't you agree?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801009": "Come. It's been so long since anyone has dared to challenge me head-on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801010": "Heheh, perhaps you can study some new chess techniques during your travels?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28801011": "I'll win someday, I promise!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802002": "Have you ever thought about the meaning of \"power\"?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802003": "Not even once.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802004": "How very innocent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802005": "Not once has a response like that ever crossed my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802006": "As a Shadow, I wish to protect the part of you that can give that kind of answer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802007": "I have, but it's a little too complicated for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802008": "And that's all you need to understand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802009": "Power is necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802010": "But in its pursuit, we must always remember to reflect on ourselves.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802011": "To ask ourselves why we desire power in the first place.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802012": "This is also very important for controlling our own thoughts and actions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802013": "I don't really have a lot of desires...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802014": "Which might be the reason I'm not as concerned about power as other people.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802015": "In saying so, you've proven that you possess power as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802016": "A kind of power that cannot be easily overlooked.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802017": "May your path always be clear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802018": "As a Shadow, I've seen far too many people fall victim to themselves in pursuit of power.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802019": "I promise to keep that in mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802020": "Thanks for looking out for me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802021": "Of course. As your friend, I will continue watching over you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28802022": "Rest assured, it's only to keep you from losing your way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803001": "My friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803002": "You seem to be in a good mood, Istvan.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803003": "For the longest time, I've been keeping myself hidden under a guise of glamor and sophistication.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803004": "It wasn't easy to finally reveal my true self...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803005": "Yet I feel incredibly happy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803006": "I'd like to invite you to come with me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803007": "Huh? Me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803008": "It's been so long since I've felt this way, and I want to stretch my legs a bit more.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803009": "Why don't we go out for a spot of hunting?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803010": "Just the two of us.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803011": "But what about Bethel and the others?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803012": "Umbraton will be perfectly safe in their hands.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803013": "Besides, it's good for me to cast off my restraints and enjoy myself from time to time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803014": "Especially since I've wanted to unleash my inner beast even more lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803015": "That sounds...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28803016": "Less and less like the Shadowlord I've always known.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804001": "Your chess skills have greatly improved.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804002": "There's no denying your potential.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804003": "Well, I have a good teacher to thank for that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804004": "I was only looking for a chess partner.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804005": "I could never take full credit for your improvement.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804006": "But I learned so much just from playing chess with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804007": "As have I, my young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804008": "Chess provides us not only with entertainment but also with opportunities for growth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804009": "A person's play style says much about them too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804010": "In that respect, you truly are a gifted individual in my eyes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804011": "Okay, now you're just flattering me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804012": "Heheh, is it going to your head?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804013": "I'm not lying, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804014": "Those who can withstand my savage attacks...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804015": "... are few and far between.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804016": "Then, I graciously accept your praise!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804017": "Good. You have every right to be confident in yourself, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804018": "You are a worthy opponent, one who can fully assess the field of battle and its intricacies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28804019": "I look forward to seeing the accomplishments you achieve on your journey.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28805001": "PlayerName, could you please come to the Bar for a moment?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28805002": "I wish to discuss a certain matter with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28805003": "So polite... I'll be right there!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28805999": "The Shadowlord has a lot of strong subordinates at his side. Is he dealing with something particularly difficult right now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841001": "What you see before you are the true face of shadow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841002": "This is the real me, the one who is free from the cumbersome trappings of civility.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841003": "Just call me Istvan. Formalities are no longer needed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841004": "I'll try my best.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841005": "You seem unsure. Is it because we aren't as close as I thought?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841006": "Or perhaps you're worried about this wilder side of me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841007": "That's not it at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841008": "We're perfectly good friends!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841009": "Everyone gets along just fine up here!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841010": "Don't worry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841011": "After emerging from the chaos, I'm not particular about my surroundings any longer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841012": "So rest assured, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841013": "When the need arises, I will become a shadow and watch over everything for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28841014": "I can't tell if that's a good thing or a bad thing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842001": "It's been so long since I've felt this good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842002": "I can use my powers freely without feeling tired in the slightest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842003": "Compared to formal business negotiations...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842004": "Attacking my enemies directly is far more satisfying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842005": "I can almost picture it in my head now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842006": "You grab someone by their tie, and then...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842007": "N-Never mind, that's so not appropriate for a business meeting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842008": "You shouldn't have anything to fear if you're a good and honest person, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842009": "Heheh, only kidding.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842010": "Even if those contrived formalities are merely my disguise...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842011": "I fully understand the importance of civility when it comes to maintaining order.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842012": "Are you sure you're just kidding?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842013": "I certainly hope so.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842014": "Though I do wish people would be more discreet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842015": "After looking upon their shadows lately...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842016": "Things may require a slightly more savage touch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28842017": "I'm really starting to worry about Umbraton...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843001": "It seems I've been too active lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843002": "My scars are starting to burn somewhat.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843003": "What? Are you okay?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843004": "Don't tell me you reopened your old wounds somehow?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843005": "No, I believe it's a sign that my powers are growing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843006": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843007": "The countless scars on my body follow me silently like my own shadow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843008": "I believe there's only one reason for them to break their silence.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843009": "My powers have grown more ferocious, and they hunger for even more.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843010": "Yet somehow, I'm not opposed to this notion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843011": "Perhaps I'm still just as dangerous as before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843012": "I don't really understand...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843013": "But I'm sure you'll be able to control this power.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843014": "I only hope your faith isn't misplaced.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843015": "For now, I'll take this savage power and return to the shadows.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843016": "May they continue watching over you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28843017": "And may the shadows watch over you too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844001": "I've finally managed to quell the flames in my heart after my last surge of power.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844002": "From now on, I will continue hiding this flaw deep within my heart.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844003": "I only hope that it remains an unspeakable secret between us.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844004": "But didn't you choose to return to your old self?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844005": "Indeed, and I refuse to hide my true self any longer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844006": "The extent of my power, however, must remain hidden as before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844007": "This is proof that my strength has grown.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844008": "Aside from you, no other living being knows about this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844009": "I see... I'm honored, Istvan.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844010": "Violence, savagery...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844011": "It seems I was born with these traits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844012": "Don't say that! I don't think you're violent at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844013": "At first, I thought these flames could never be extinguished, so I tried to hide them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844014": "But now I'm able to turn it all into fuel for my powers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844015": "At some point in the future, they will run rampant once again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844016": "When that day comes, our enemies will be reduced to ashes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844017": "I only hope that they will serve to protect you all, and the future in which I believe.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844018": "I believe in you, Istvan.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844019": "Let's do our best together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28844020": "Hopefully we'll purge this world of evil someday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851002": "Good morning, Shadowlord.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851003": "Just call me Istvan.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851004": "There's no need to be so formal with me now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851005": "But it feels a little embarrassing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851006": "What's so wrong about calling me by my name?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851007": "You must have picked up a few outdated customs from those Lumopolis nobles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851008": "I-I'm sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851009": "I'll address you by your name from now on!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851010": "I'm just worried other people will think I'm being disrespectful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28851011": "Hahaha. How we choose to address each other is no one else's concern.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28852001": "You're up quite early.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28852002": "Do you enjoy seeing the sunrise too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28852003": "Or are you just that diligent?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28852004": "I got woken up, actually...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28852005": "Young people like you should sleep more. It's good for your body.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28852006": "But since you're awake, enjoy your morning as much as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28852007": "Don't squander any of your time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28852008": "The shadow is always watching.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28852009": "Thanks, I feel a lot more motivated now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853001": "Have you woken up yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853002": "I just did...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853003": "Good. It seems you can maintain your self-discipline after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853004": "When everything around us is in a constant state of flux...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853005": "It pleases me very much to see you like this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853006": "I'm still in bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853007": "Indolence is never a good look.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853008": "Especially on you, Master of the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853009": "You should strive to do better.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853010": "But why...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853011": "Waking up early every day feels so exhausting...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853012": "How do you manage to get up so early every day?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853013": "Umbraton isn't nearly kind enough to gently stir its people from their sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853014": "Those who cannot wake up will eventually lose themselves to the darkness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853015": "And so I resist sleep as though it were my mortal enemy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853016": "What an unexpected response.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853017": "It's almost kind of cool!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28853018": "Hahaha, you think so? In any case, I wish you a good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28861001": "Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28861002": "I was just on my way to get lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28861003": "You and Bethel can be so problematic at times.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28861004": "Young people should cherish their health more.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28861005": "There are many people in the world who would do anything for a decent lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28861006": "I-I'm sorry! I'll go eat right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28861007": "That's better.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862001": "You should rest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862002": "Though it may be better to ask what you're still doing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862003": "Just taking care of a few things, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862004": "We should all know our own limits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862005": "Only then can we make more meaningful progress.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862006": "So what do you usually do when you're in my situation?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862007": "I finish the tasks at hand and get plenty of rest afterward.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862008": "Isn't that the same as what I'm doing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862009": "Yes, but I'm fully aware of my own limits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862010": "Then why are you lecturing me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862011": "Hahaha! Perhaps it's just a habit that comes with being a Shadow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862012": "In any case, I do wish you would get more rest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862013": "For young people like yourselves, there's always tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862014": "May the shadow always watch over you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28862015": "I'll go take a break right away!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881001": "Veiled by the night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881002": "Good, it seems you've finally learned to coexist with the darkness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881003": "I'm just up a bit later than usual, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881004": "What a pity. The moon is especially beautiful tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881005": "The perfect night for a glass of wine and a game of chess in the moonlight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881006": "Unfortunately, you're still not old enough for that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881007": "Don't stay up too late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881008": "Were you reminiscing about the past and looking for someone to play against?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881009": "You could tell?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881010": "It seems I've changed even more than I thought...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881011": "What's that supposed to mean...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881012": "Anyway, I don't mind keeping you company.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881013": "No, no. Far be it from me to disturb the peaceful dreams of others.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881014": "Goodnight, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28881015": "Good night... Try to get some sleep too, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28882001": "Staying awake at this hour will do your body no favors.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28882002": "Especially in terms of your height.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28882003": "Huh?! Is it really that bad?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28882004": "Adequate rest is just as important as adequate nutrition.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28882005": "My physical health is proof enough of that, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28882006": "I'll go to bed right now then!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28882007": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28882008": "Sleep well, my young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28882009": "May the shadows watch over you in your dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901001": "How long have we known each other now, my dear? Or rather, how long have we been working together?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901002": "I don't know the exact amount of time, but it's definitely been a while.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901003": "Why do you ask all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901004": "I was just wondering whether or not we should designate an anniversary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901005": "An anniversary?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901006": "In my opinion, you are undoubtedly one of my most special customers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901007": "So why shouldn't I designate an anniversary with a customer like you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901008": "... I-I don't think that's really necessary. I feel a little embarrassed just talking about it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901009": "Don't worry, you and I are the only ones who will know about this anniversary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901010": "In other words, it'll be our little \"trade secret.\" What do you say?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901011": "Well, a \"trade secret\" like that would be nice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28901012": "I just knew you would agree! So... How about today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902001": "Do you have any time to meet with me tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902002": "Tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902003": "Is that a no?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902004": "N-No, I can definitely meet you tomorrow. I just wasn't expecting you to set a time so quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902005": "Heheh, it's no different than doing business. Good opportunities are easily missed if you aren't decisive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902006": "Your choices must be both quick and accurate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902007": "I feel like that applies to just about everything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902008": "So why are we meeting up again?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902009": "Oh? Did I forget to tell you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902010": "You definitely didn't, Lady Sheol.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902011": "Heheh, I'm only joking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902012": "It's nothing serious. I just need you to try on a few outfits tomorrow, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902013": "Outfits?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902014": "No matter where you go or what you do, you seem to wear the exact same clothes all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902015": "Which is why I took the liberty of preparing a number of semi-formal \"victorious\" outfits for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902016": "You're not gonna make me the mascot of another publicity stunt, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902017": "Oh my, am I that easy to read? Very well, I won't trouble you about that anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28902018": "I'll just have a cute little Courier deliver the clothes directly to you. Consider it a gift for one of my best and oldest customers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903001": "You know we have something special in common, don't you dear?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903002": "What's that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903003": "Even from our earliest memories, we have zero recollection of our parents.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903004": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903005": "As sad as it is, we aren't nearly as unfortunate as other people may think.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903006": "You had your Colossus to teach you and keep you company, and after I survived that catastrophe...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903007": "Heheh, it's best if I don't bring up the rest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903008": "In any case, you met Vice and the others soon afterward and had so many new experiences.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903009": "I'm sorry to interrupt, Lady Sheol, but I don't really get what you're saying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903010": "What I mean is that our origins are the same, yet we walk completely different paths in life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903011": "Don't you find that interesting?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903012": "I can't imagine many people in the world have experienced the same things as we have.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903013": "Indeed, just like no two Nightium are exactly alike.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903014": "In my eyes, every single Nightium is unique.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903015": "And that, my dear customer, is all that I wanted to tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903016": "I hope that our relationship can go beyond just being partners someday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903017": "B-Beyond just partners?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903018": "Like \"strategic partners,\" for example.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903019": "Oh! Well, that does sound pretty cool.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28903020": "Heheh, I'm glad you like it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28904001": "When you have some time, would you mind coming to see me in the Lounge, my dear?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28904002": "Sure, I'll head over right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28904003": "Please come alone, if you would.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28904999": "Lady Sheol made it very clear that she wishes to see you in private. What could she want to sell you this time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941001": "Keep my business card nice and safe, won't you, dear?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941002": "Try not to lose my contact information. Plenty of people have tried their hardest to get it, but to no avail.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941003": "Don't worry, Lady Sheol.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941004": "I already uploaded it carefully to my terminal, so there's no chance I'll lose it anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941005": "Oh? You mean you didn't memorize it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941006": "I memorize the contact information of all my customers, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941007": "Oh... Th-Then I'll go memorize it right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941008": "Heheh, I can't help but tease a customer as cute as yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941009": "But rest assured, I'll try my best to keep my teasing private.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941010": "I'd prefer it if you didn't tease me at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941011": "And that reaction is precisely why I do it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941012": "But let's dispense with the greetings, shall we?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941013": "Now that we've established a stable form of communication, I really must get going.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941014": "Get going? Is something the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941015": "I'm sorry, that has to remain a secret for now. But I can assure you—",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941016": "My plans will definitely benefit both of us.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28941017": "The Cloudrover Guild looks forward to working with you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942001": "Greetings, valued customer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942002": "Lady Sheol?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942003": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942004": "Wait, shouldn't I be asking you that? You're the one who greeted me so oddly just now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942005": "Heheh, is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942006": "I'm sorry, I was just trying to recall my original self.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942007": "Your original self?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942008": "Specifically, the person I was when I first started doing business.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942009": "Back then, I was still so young and bashful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942010": "... I can't even picture you like that, Lady Sheol.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942011": "And that's probably for the best.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942012": "Why is that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942013": "If you did, I might have to help you forget that image of me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942014": "By force, if necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28942015": "Yikes!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943001": "Have you ever considered keeping a pet, my dear?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943002": "A pet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943003": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943004": "Is that so? What a shame.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943005": "Why's that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943006": "No reason, really. The pet industry seems to have potential, so I thought I'd ask for your opinion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943007": "But it appears you don't have much interest in pets.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943008": "It's not like I'm entirely uninterested. I just don't know if I can take good care of a pet...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943009": "I'm sure you would be a kind and responsible pet owner.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943010": "Do the Fireflies count?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943011": "The Fireflies are indeed very cute. Maybe they do count as pets?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943012": "On that note, may I ask if the Fireflies are for sale?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943013": "Absolutely not!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943014": "In all honesty, I'm not surprised by your response.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943015": "So what exactly do you think of pets, Lady Sheol?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943016": "Me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943017": "If I had to, I would take a snake as my pet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943018": "You mean like the smoky one that comes out of your pipe when you fight?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943019": "Heheh, that reminds me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943020": "Huh?! That thing was alive all along!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943021": "Sorry, but the rest is a trade secret.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28943022": "One that I can't share with anyone, not even you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944001": "Generally speaking, a boss shouldn't have to do everything on their own.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944002": "That much is easy to understand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944003": "I believe you know exactly what I mean, my dear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944004": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944005": "See, I left home with nothing, and I founded the Cloudrover Guild from nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944006": "Naturally, I couldn't rely on my strength to achieve that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944007": "In order to get ahead, I had to fully assess my surroundings and manipulate things from behind the scenes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944008": "That certainly sounds like you, Lady Sheol.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944009": "Even if my combat strength has grown, I still think this is the best way of doing things.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944010": "Huh? Your combat strength has grown? Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944011": "You seem to be missing the point...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944012": "But that's just the kind of person you are. It's also the reason why so many Aurorians are willing to fight at your side.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944013": "It seems I've gotten more prone to rambling as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944014": "So does that mean you're willing to fight at my side too, Lady Sheol?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28944015": "Heheh, I really don't know what to do with you sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28951001": "Good morning, my dear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28951002": "Good morning, Lady Sheol.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28951003": "The weather sure is nice today, huh? It's perfect for an outing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28951004": "Yes, it's a perfect day to make money as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28951005": "Um, c-could you not spoil the moment like that please?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28951006": "I don't think I ruined the moment at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28951007": "As a businessperson, if I'm not making money, then I should be trying to make money. Wouldn't you agree?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28951008": "I mean, yes, but...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952001": "Good morning, my dear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952002": "Lady Sheol? Didn't you sleep last night? You're up so early.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952003": "In a manner of speaking, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952004": "Staying up all night is bad for you. Were you having trouble sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952005": "Not at all. I just needed to attend to some last-minute business, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952006": "I see. Don't work too hard, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952007": "How did you sleep last night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952008": "Me? Fine, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952009": "But if you're all done with your business, why don't you try getting some sleep now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952010": "You're even sweeter than I imagined, my dear. I'll go do just that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28952011": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28953001": "Good morning, my dear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28953002": "Oh? Still in bed, are we?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28953003": "I-I'm awake!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28953004": "Heheh, then I won't tease you any further.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28953005": "I'm almost awake...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28953006": "That's the first time I've ever heard anyone say it like that. Could it be that my cute little customer wants to sleep in today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28953007": "If you feel you haven't slept enough, a little more rest is perfectly fine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28953008": "But remember, a day's plan starts in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28953009": "It seems I'll just have to find someone else to handle all of these lucrative little jobs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28953010": "Ah! Wh-Why didn't you say so earlier...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28961001": "Come visit the Cloudrover Guild, won't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28961002": "Sure! Is something up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28961003": "Oh? Am I only allowed to invite guests to the guild if I have business with them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28961004": "I-I didn't mean it like that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28961005": "Heheh, don't worry. I know what you meant.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28961006": "If you hurry, you might even make it in time for lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28961007": "Though I'd like to entrust you with a small task, if you accept.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28961008": "So it really was for business after all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28961009": "Oh, don't say that. I'll even throw in today's lunch, if you'd like?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962001": "Come visit the Cloudrover Guild, won't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962002": "Sorry, now's not a good time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962003": "Busy with something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962004": "It's the Fireflies! They're going haywire!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962005": "Oh? Sounds like fun.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962006": "It's not fun at all, Lady Sheol! If you have time to chat, then come help me catch these guys!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962007": "I'm sorry, the signal isn't too strong here. I couldn't hear anything you just said.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962008": "But we're not talking on the phone!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962009": "Just a small problem, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962010": "Need a hand?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962011": "A little help would be greatly appreciated right now, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962012": "Please don't charge me too much for it, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962013": "Heheh, not a problem. After all, you're one of my most valued customers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962014": "Hmm... I'm sure Dayna and the others wouldn't mind coming along either.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962015": "I'll let them decide on the rate. Is that acceptable?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28962016": "Uh... I-I think I'll just handle it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28963001": "Come visit the Cloudrover Guild, won't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28963002": "Sure. I was just about to look for you too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28963003": "What a coincidence, hmm?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28963004": "Now, how may I help you, my dear customer?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28963005": "It's nothing big, really.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28963006": "I just had a few questions about my finances, and who better to ask than the president of the Cloudrover Guild?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28963007": "Heheh, I had no idea you were so good at flattery.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28963008": "Unfortunately, flattery isn't nearly enough to pay for my financial advice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28963009": "Ah, I-I understand... I'll just keep saving my money then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981001": "Are you asleep, my dear?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981002": "Yep!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981003": "I'm not so sure that a sleeping person could reply to me on their terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981004": "Then I guess that means I'm not asleep yet!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981005": "Feeling humorous today, aren't we?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981006": "Not yet, what's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981007": "Nothing, really.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981008": "Nothing? That doesn't sound like the Lady Sheol I know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981009": "Oh? May I ask what you think of me then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981010": "You're a smart and hard-working businessperson who dislikes wasting time, especially on greetings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981011": "What a prompt, if somewhat rigid answer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981012": "When it comes to business, greetings are always extremely important. Remember that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981013": "Good night, and sweet dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28981014": "You too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982001": "Are you asleep, my dear?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982002": "Just getting ready for bed. What about you, Lady Sheol?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982003": "I need to stay up for a bit longer tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982004": "Still handling business, even at this hour?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982005": "Yes, that's right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982006": "I'm trying to figure out how to sell my latest products to you at the highest possible price.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982007": "I'm pretty sure one of us has to be dreaming right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982008": "Heheh, only joking. There's no need to be so guarded around me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982009": "Please, Lady Sheol. Your jokes are enough to make me lose sleep most of the time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982010": "Is that so? I had no idea they were so potent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28982011": "Enough, please! I'm no match for you, Lady Sheol...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28983001": "Today has been yet another rewarding day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28983002": "You're in a good mood today, Lady Sheol. Did you land a big deal today or something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28983003": "Yes, but it's still far from the big deal I have in my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28983004": "Today's deal was more like a \"small milestone\" of sorts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28983005": "A \"small milestone\"?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28983006": "Before that, how was business for you today?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28983007": "M-Me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_28983008": "Haha... The same losses as usual, but at least they're stable...",
  "str_quest_chat01_28983009": "I'm truly sad to hear that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_28983010": "It's fine, I got used to it a long time ago.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001001": "It's worth mentioning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001002": "I noticed the condition of your skin the other day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001003": "You don't pay much attention to skincare, do you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001004": "Wait, you care about this kind of stuff too?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001005": "Why are you so surprised?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001006": "The skin acts as the body's first line of defense against bacteria.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001007": "It needs to be kept in an unassailable state.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001008": "But you, you're just barely meeting the standards.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001009": "A shame I don't really care for this usually...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001010": "Uh-oh, now that you've pointed it out...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001011": "My face starts to feel a bit dry...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001012": "That's normal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001013": "You're always on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001014": "The air at high altitudes is inherently drier than on the ground.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001015": "Without me to point you in the right direction,",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001016": "you'll start getting wrinkles in a few more years.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001017": "Master! Guide me, please!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001018": "Drink more hot water.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001019": "Huh?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001020": "And then, get yourself a humidifier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001021": "A, uh, humidifier?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001022": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001023": "I'll send one to you later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001024": "Please accept my gratitude as endless as the aurora!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001025": "Sigh!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29001026": "How would the world go on without me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002001": "Saw this on my way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002002": "A flower that only opens for an hour in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002004": "Bet you haven't seen this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002005": "Hmm?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002006": "Thank you for sharing this with me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002007": "If you like it, you should go to Eraveil and see when you get a chance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002008": "This kind of flower blooms everywhere. It's gorgeous to hike the mountains in the morning!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002009": "E-V-E-R-Y-W-H-E-R-E?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002010": "A \"friend of mine\" said she was frustrated by it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002011": "Seriously?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002012": "But my gratitude is genuine!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002013": "But I genuinely didn't expect...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002014": "Eraveil could be such a gem of biodiversity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002015": "Maybe it's worth taking some time to visit there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002016": "Absolutely!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002017": "I hardly ever come across a place more beautiful than Eraveil...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002018": "I guess it's mostly due to my personal preference, though!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002019": "I trust your aesthetic judgment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002020": "However, while I do grow some plants from time to time...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002021": "I'm not a biology expert after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002022": "Wandering around the Eraveil without a guide seems inefficient.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002023": "I can be your guide, remember?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002024": "Whenever you're free, anytime works for me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002025": "Eraveil is my turf!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002026": "I'll definitely show you around when you come.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002027": "Haha, you're sharp. You perfectly caught my hint.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002028": "That friend of mine said she recovered from the frustration.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002029": "That \"friend of yours\" is actually yourself, isn't it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002030": "Even your mockery is spot-on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29002031": "You won't be able to get rid of me ever!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003001": "They're at it again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003002": "When will they get it? Science is just science.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003003": "It's not meant for their political maneuvers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003004": "Sigh... given your stance, these things are unavoidable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003005": "But you don't seem like someone they can manipulate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003006": "Certainly not. Don't assume I'll passively accept it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003007": "I work out regularly...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003008": "Not just to get a few compliments from the doctor",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003009": "Haha, I admire this side of you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003010": "It's worth mentioning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003011": "I'm always whining to you about this and that",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003012": "You rarely open up to me about your troubles",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003013": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003014": "Can I, um, share my troubles with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003015": "What do you mean by can",
  "str_quest_chat01_29003016": "But you're so busy...",

  "str_quest_chat01_29102004": "What kind of wishes are there?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102005": "Like wishes for good weather, family safety, happy marriages...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102006": "Honestly, most of these aren't really within my power!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102007": "When making wishes to a deity, folks tend to get greedy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102008": "I need to remember this and not let it happen to me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102009": "But... Are you a bit too NOT greedy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102010": "You hardly ever make a wish to me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102011": "There's a lot I could help you with, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102012": "I've made many wishes to you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102013": "Every time I face a tough battle...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102014": "I ask for help, and you've always come through.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102015": "That's no big deal; can't be considered as wishes, really.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102016": "Shouldn't you at least wish for gold and silver?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102017": "Let me have a chance to show my power!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102018": "Haha, what's that saying in Longzhou?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102019": "\"Good friendship outshines a golden house.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102020": "To spend each day joyfully with you is better than anything!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102021": "Hmm... is this your wish, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29102022": "Well then, I shall endeavor to bring thy wish to fruition.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29103001": "There's a special delight in sleeping on land.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29103002": "Even in the dead of night, there are always insects buzzing and small creatures scurrying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29103003": "So not like the deep sea's quiet.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29104003": "There are plenty of interesting places.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29104004": "Why ask, do you want to go out for some fun?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29104005": "Hmm, let's talk about it when we meet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29104006": "I'll be waiting for you on the Bridge!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29104999": "Can't really turn down the Dragon Maiden's request. Hurry to the Bridge to meet her!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141001": "Thy abode, soaring through the sky, is wondrous indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141002": "The space within is boundless and vast.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141003": "Compared to this, even my sacred temple pales.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141004": "Err... I'm sorry for making you feel that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141005": "You don't have to apologize.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141006": "Temples are but the places where the masses anchor their beliefs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141007": "Their value lies not in lavish splendor.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141008": "Yet, thy abode is a dwelling for many.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141009": "Comfort and spaciousness are rightly so.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141010": "Phew... thanks for the compliment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141011": "This is my first time hosting a deity of Longzhou on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141012": "Oh, right!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141013": "The Colossus is pretty huge indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141014": "Feel free to explore; there are plenty of rooms to check out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141015": "The scenery on the deck is especially good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141016": "Highly recommend going for the view!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141017": "Really?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141018": "I've never been to such an interesting place before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141019": "Can't wait to check out around!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141020": "Gotta go! See you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29141021": "Huh?! O-Okay, see you around!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142001": "I once believed my divine power to be nigh infinite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142002": "Yet beyond the infinite, there lies room for further growth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142003": "Wow...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142004": "Chen'ni, given your might, if you progress any further...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142005": "Hardly anyone on the whole continent can rival you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142006": "Oh? The implication of thy words...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142007": "There remain a few who might approach my level.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142008": "The progress of mundane beings is indeed heartening.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142009": "... Looks like I've started a risky subject.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142010": "Discussions like \"power rankings\"...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142011": "Could literally start wars!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142012": "The dispute over strength rankings is truly fruitless.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142013": "Truth be told, my power had remained unprogressed for ages.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142014": "By a twist of fate, I journey with thee across foreign lands.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142015": "Each day brings forth sights anew; such is the cause of my breakthrough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142016": "If mundane beings of this land seek breakthroughs, they may learn from my experience and journey to Longzhou.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142017": "Far better than the ceaseless contention of strength with peers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142018": "Excellently spoken! I deeply concur.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142019": "Is this how they speak in Longzhou?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142020": "Verily so!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29142021": "Thy progress too, is commendable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143001": "Hey, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143002": "I saw quite a few people bustling around on the big platform out there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143003": "What are they doing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143004": "Haha, you're talking about the Bridge, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143005": "It just started raining cats and dogs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143006": "A flash of lightning damaged the equipment on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143007": "Vice and the others are trying to fix it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143008": "Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143009": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143010": "It's my fault...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143011": "I thought, after all, I'm what the Dragon Maiden Over Turbulent Seas Dance is based on.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143012": "If I mess it up when Vice comes to learn, it would be quite embarrassing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143013": "So I practiced for a while in secret...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143014": "To my surprise, my strength has grown too powerful lately...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143015": "Ended up calling down a thunderstorm...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143016": "I'm so sorry... PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143017": "Your dance... brought a thunderstorm?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143018": "How strong has your power grown?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143019": "No need to make a fuss; I am, after all, a divine dragon!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143020": "Oh, right, I should go help Vice first...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29143021": "See you later, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144001": "PlayerName, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144002": "Notice any changes in your room?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144003": "Changes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144004": "The fruit tarts Vice bought me have mysteriously disappeared.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144005": "So yummy. Vice is the best!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144006": "The 3D puzzle Carleen gave me was all put together overnight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144007": "Impressive, aren't I?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144008": "Think Carleen can buy me a new one? I'll trade it with my dragon blessing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144009": "Oh, Chen'ni...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144010": "Nothing. As long as you're happy, that's what counts!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144011": "What else, any other discoveries?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144012": "Other stuff... Oh! The busted lights are all fixed up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144013": "Did you have someone fix them too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144014": "I fixed it myself!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144015": "You fixed it?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144016": "When did you learn these skills?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144017": "I heard that to get machines running, you need to power them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144018": "And you know what? There was thunder and lightning in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144019": "So, I harnessed a bolt of lightning to power it up big time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144020": "Good heavens!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144021": "I get it. You're surprised at how powerful my strength has become, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144022": "Even my control over the strength is top-notch now. Pretty impressive, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144023": "Impressive indeed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144024": "So glad my Colossus is still safely flying in the sky...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144025": "Hmm? What's that supposed to mean?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144026": "It's nothing... nothing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144027": "But next time a device breaks, please call me to fix it, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29144028": "Please, Chen'ni...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151001": "The morning sky's color today looks like my scales.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151002": "Really? That must be exceptionally beautiful; I'd love to see it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151003": "You wanna see it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151004": "Too bad I'm in the middle of something; can't take you to the sky to see it now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151005": "Up to the sky?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151006": "Wait... You mean, you will take the dragon form?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151007": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151008": "Why so surprised? You don't like dragons?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151009": "You just prefer my current form, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151010": "No, no, no! I like you either way!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151011": "Just that my body probably can't withstand the power of a dragon's soar...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29151012": "But thanks for your kind offer, Almighty Benevolent Dragon Divinity!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152001": "This \"alarm clock\" thing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152002": "Is this a new invention?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152003": "Haha, it might not be considered new anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152004": "What about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152005": "Just now, it suddenly made a really loud noise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152006": "Startled me quite a lot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152007": "And messed up my peaceful sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152008": "Woke you up, did it? Let me apologize on behalf of all the mortals.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152009": "But that's exactly the purpose of an alarm clock.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152010": "To wake people up every morning, so they can start work on time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152011": "This happens every morning...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152012": "Sleep gets cut short every day...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29152013": "You're all living a tough life indeed!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153001": "It's said that Astra folks have a special morning drink.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153002": "And they call it \"coffee.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153003": "What's that exactly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153004": "Considering its basic ingredients...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153005": "It's made from beans, sorta like an energy-boosting bean milk.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153006": "Considering its function...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153007": "It boosts your energy, like some sort of tea in black color.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153008": "Wow!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153009": "Sounds intriguing; I'd like to try it too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153010": "Absolutely not. Coffee isn't suitable for kids!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153011": "I, the major fiendling, have endured not just centuries but a millennium and beyond.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153012": "One shall not compare me to the mundane younglings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153013": "... Hold on, PlayerName, you knew all that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153014": "You're just joking with me, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29153015": "Please don't be mad. I'll offer you the finest coffee beans right away!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161001": "The sea is calm right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161002": "Enjoying the sea view again?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161003": "I've heard that the sea is always calm in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161004": "Such words do not hold truth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161005": "Waves always manifest their power, irrespective of day or night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161006": "The shipwrecks that befall in the afternoon are no less frequent than at any other time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161007": "The current calmness is naught but a fortuitous equilibrium in the realm of nature.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161008": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161009": "Guess a lot of this \"common sense\" stuff is actually inaccurate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161010": "Behold—",
  "str_quest_chat01_29161011": "The wind has picked up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162001": "What a nice sunny day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162002": "My temple is really bustling with worshippers!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162003": "Haha, sunny weather always brings folks outside.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162004": "But on the flip side...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162005": "On rainy or stormy days, are you going to starve?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162006": "But if the sun is too baking...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162007": "If the sun's baking hard for days, you wouldn't go starve, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162008": "Just the opposite, actually.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162009": "The more extreme the weather, the more lavish and grand the offerings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162010": "If there are erupting floods or persisting droughts...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162011": "The offerings might just overwhelm my temple!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162012": "Turns out the offerings for deities are guaranteed, no matter what the weather is...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162013": "Alas, in contrast, life's hard for the people.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162014": "Indeed, so I must take responsibility and step up when seeing such disasters.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29162015": "Being a deity is easy, but being mundane is not!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163001": "I've been sleeping for a few hundred years...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163002": "There's actually so much fun and tasty stuff in the mortal world now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163003": "Check out these candied haws, green tea pastries, marshmallows...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163004": "I'll sell all my jewelry just to buy them all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163005": "Take it easy there!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163006": "Chen'ni, if you pawn all your treasures...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163007": "You could pretty much buy up the whole city!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163008": "Wait, that's an option?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163009": "I'd never have thought of it if you hadn't brought it up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163010": "Thanks, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163011": "Wait, how did you take that as a suggestion...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29163012": "Come back, Dragon Maiden!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181001": "Caught it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181002": "Caught what? What did you catch, and with what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181003": "Heehee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181004": "There's this big ol' snake showing up at night, freaking citizens out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181005": "I was just idling anyway, so I tried to catch it with my bracelet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181006": "Bracelet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181007": "Your bracelet must be quite precious... you didn't lose it, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181008": "Rest easy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181009": "It's a top-quality gold bracelet that shines bright under the moonlight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181010": "It can't be lost.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181011": "The thought of such a precious item being thrown out there...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181012": "Just makes my heart hurt...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181013": "As the Almighty Benevolent Dragon Divinity, I shall always protect my worshippers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181014": "Plus, I wish to capture the snake to keep as a pet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29181015": "... Somehow, I feel that the second reason is the real one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182001": "Just now, two thieves sneaked into my temple.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182002": "They dared to steal in your temple?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182003": "Hard to believe, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182004": "I scared them off.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182005": "Did you manifest in your true form?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182006": "No, no need for something so dramatic; a couple of thunderclaps were enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182007": "As you know, in Longzhou, thunder is seen as a divine retribution.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182008": "It's more frightening than showing your true form!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182009": "They kinda brought it on themselves.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182010": "Were you mad about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182011": "You have reasons to be, you know, those two thieves were way out of line.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182012": "Exactly!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182013": "Of all times to steal, they chose when I was hungry.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182014": "With them wandering all over, how was I supposed to get the offerings?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29182015": "So that's what makes you mad...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183001": "Just a moment ago, a vessel departed the harbor without permission.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183002": "No permission means no lights. Isn't that super risky?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183003": "The young fisherman is blinded by his arrogance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183004": "Under the veil of night, he seeks to fish alone, claiming the harvest solely for himself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183005": "Based on how the sky looks tonight...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183006": "He is destined with more misfortune than luck.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183007": "Even though he brought it on himself...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183008": "But it seems wrong to just leave him be...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183009": "How can I disregard such a plight?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183010": "Until his vessel capsizes and he falls into the sea, seeking life in despair...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183011": "I shall save him then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183012": "Why wait until such then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183013": "The Dragon Maiden can protect him for a moment, but not for a lifetime.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183014": "For those who fail to heed lessons, their undoing is imminent.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29183015": "I see now... The ways of deities are really deep and complex.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201001": "PlayerName, I'm here—",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201002": "I've come across a bunch of new things today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201003": "And I shared the deets about fiendlings with a bunch of new friends.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201004": "Feels fantastic!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201005": "Glad to hear it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201006": "I heard feedback from everyone about the fiendling lecture.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201007": "It's pretty good; let's keep exchanging knowledge on stuff we find interesting!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201008": "Folks on this continent are quite friendly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201009": "The way of life here has quite a few things in common with Longzhou.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201010": "Our aims are the same; the differences are mainly in the methods.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201011": "Let's keep exchanging ideas like this in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29201012": "It'll surely be beneficial for both sides.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202001": "PlayerName, we've known each other for quite some time now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202002": "Lately, I've been feeling more and more that you're one of my kind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202003": "How so?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202004": "You're pretty good at spotting the strengths and potential in others.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202005": "You also give advice and direction for everyone's continuous improvement.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202006": "In this regard, you're just like me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202007": "Are you referring to your experience guiding fiendlings?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202008": "Yep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202009": "Come to think of it, it does seem that way...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202010": "Just like how I've been uncovering the abilities of these little fiendlings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202011": "You're providing guidance for ones on this big ship.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202012": "And I am also one of those guided by you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202013": "I'll be sticking around for a while in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29202014": "Allow me to thank you in advance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29203001": "PlayerName, mind going with me to Twin Pavilions Bay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29203002": "What are you heading there for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29203003": "I have accepted a job in Twin Pavilions Bay, but I haven't been around there much...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29203004": "So, I was hoping you could be my guide in case I break any rules or be rude.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29203005": "Sure thing, I'm free now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29203006": "Great! I'll be waiting for you at the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29203999": "Luo Song is waiting for you on the Bridge. Go meet him now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241001": "Ultimate move... Um, the ultimate move...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241002": "You seem troubled, which is pretty rare.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241003": "You jest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241004": "The little ones' strange requests are giving me a headache.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241005": "Ah Ding and the others...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241006": "They seem to have seen the puppet shows over here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241007": "Now, they want to train in things like fusion moves and transcendence moves.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241008": "They, however, haven't got the basics down yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241009": "That's pretty much like trying to run without learning how to walk.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241010": "It sounds pretty fun, at least.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241011": "Is there a way to make it happen?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241012": "Well, it means extra intense training!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241013": "No time to waste; I'll round them up now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29241014": "It might actually work out; you just wait and see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242001": "PlayerName, I'm feeling a bit down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242003": "I just ran into a weird guy from Longzhou outside.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242004": "He was playing tricks, scamming folks for money.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242005": "You know I can't stand folks like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242006": "So you gave him a piece of your mind?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242007": "If that were the case, I wouldn't be this disheartened.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242008": "So what happened then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242009": "Then, I tried to expose his tricks in front of everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242010": "No clue how he did it, but his trick had no flaws.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242011": "Then he publicly challenged me, saying to fight it out with me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242012": "Of course, I didn't back down. But I ended up losing pretty badly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242013": "Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242014": "How could someone be so talented,",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242015": "but choose to spout nonsense and scam for a living?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242016": "I just don't get it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242017": "Haha... Indeed, I didn't get it either...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242018": "Gotta admit, there's always someone better.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242019": "I might not agree with his ways, but I should respect his skill.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242020": "During our fight, I kinda picked up a few new moves.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242021": "They will surely be useful in my next fight...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29242022": "Can't wait to test them out!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251001": "Hmm... The sun is especially bright this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251002": "Seems like we're going to have an idle day today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251003": "Why's that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251004": "Because those bad fiendlings won't choose a day like this to cause trouble.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251005": "Fiendlings are surprisingly well-behaved when it's sunny like this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251006": "There are some baseless theories about this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251007": "They claim the sun's Yang energy suppresses the fiendlings, then peddle potions to boost it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251008": "But actually, I checked with Ah Ding and others about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251009": "What did they say?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251010": "They simply think the weather's too good...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29251011": "And it will be a waste not to catch some good sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252001": "Morning, had breakfast yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252002": "Any chance there's extra breakfast around here?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252003": "Yep, had my fill.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252004": "Extra breakfast? Why ask?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252005": "Ah Ding thinks your breakfast looks delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252006": "He's now making a fuss, wanting a taste of the exotic fare.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252007": "Now, all the other fiendlings are acting up as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252008": "They've been putting in some serious effort lately, so...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252009": "Well, they deserve a reward indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252010": "There must be some leftovers, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252011": "You can hit up the canteen and see if there's anything left.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252012": "Really? Thanks a lot!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29252013": "I'm heading there right away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261001": "These little fiendlings really lack of willpower.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261003": "We went out to deal with some wicked spirits earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261004": "Ended up missing our mealtime accidentally.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261005": "For cultivators like me, we don't eat after noon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261006": "Once we miss lunchtime, we'll not eat randomly, you know, to keep a regular schedule.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261007": "But they've been whining about how hungry they are.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261008": "Not just fiendlings, we get hungry as well if like this, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261009": "How can you train properly without being well-fed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261010": "You do have a point there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29261011": "Then, I'll allow them a little something to fill their stomachs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29281001": "Sorry for the trouble Ah Ding has brought.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29281002": "It gets a bit excited as soon as night falls.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29281003": "I really hope it doesn't cause any trouble.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29281004": "Why does it get excited at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29281005": "Maybe it's because it's a tiger and has nocturnal habits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29281006": "Fiendlings don't sleep at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29281007": "Well, it probably depends on their specific type.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29281008": "Generally speaking, fiendlings tend to be more active at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29281009": "Well, it's time to keep an eye on that little guy now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282001": "PlayerName, heard there are folks organizing night runs around here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282002": "Is that true?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282003": "Yep, I've heard about it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282004": "Probably because it's good for the health.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282005": "A big world full of surprises, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282006": "Any issue with night runs?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282007": "Nah, just strikes me as a bit unusual, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282008": "Here on this continent, Aurorians run around at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282009": "And those who look like fiendlings hustle during the day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282010": "Feels like I've broadened my horizons!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282011": "Why not join in? You might find some kindred spirits.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29282012": "Alright, I will!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283001": "PlayerName, are you ever into monster stories?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283002": "You mean those fiendling stories popular in Longzhou?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283003": "Yep, exactly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283004": "They remind me of the days at the temple.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283005": "Life on the mountain was simple yet dull.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283006": "So, every midnight, my senior brothers and sisters used to gather up...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283007": "And share all kinds of monster stories.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283008": "Though I thought exaggerating and scaring folks wasn't great...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283009": "Such stories were fascinating, like the demon-slaying notes written by the elders.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283010": "Maybe I should grab one or two at Twin Pavilions Bay when I'm free.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29283011": "You definitely should!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29284001": "Sigh, can't sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29284002": "Don't know why, but I'm feeling an extra kick of excitement tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29284003": "Let me guess...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29284004": "Because someone tricked you into drinking coffee, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29284005": "You mean the brown beverage?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29284006": "Wasn't it supposed to be good for the stomach and energy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29284007": "Never thought it'd mess with my sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29284008": "Alright, I'm going to do those, um, push-ups.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29284009": "Maybe I can get sleepy after the exercise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301001": "Northland has indeed opened up now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301002": "I even find tourist scammers there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301003": "Wait, what?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301004": "Just the thought that you might run into them as well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301005": "It makes me mad.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301006": "Um, what sort of scammers are we talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301007": "They claim that they have \"Snow Fox Teeth\"...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301008": "And the teeth can ward off evil.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301009": "But actually, they're just dog teeth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301010": "For real?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301011": "Why the fuss?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301012": "... I, uh, a friend of mine...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301013": "He bought something like that on the last trip there.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301014": "Please take a look; is it the real deal?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301015": "(Image)",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301016": "Obviously, it's a fake.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301017": "It's the lower left canine from a dog.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301018": "Oh noooo... my money...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301019": "No... my friend's money...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301020": "You seem upset...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301021": "Looks like you really care about your friend.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301022": "I've got tons of Snow Fox Teeth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301023": "Not sure if they ward off evil stuff.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301024": "But they're pretty nice to look at.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301025": "You can have them. Feel free to share them with your friends.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301026": "You can stop feelin' sad now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29301027": "Oh, thanks... Sob...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302001": "Weird.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302002": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302003": "When I'm just chilling, doing nothing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302004": "I usually think of Her Majesty the Queen.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302005": "About her greatness and sacrifices...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302006": "And how I can better protect her.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302007": "Haha, you've always been a big fan of the Queen.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302008": "So, what's so weird about it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302009": "But just now, I surprisingly caught myself thinking about you for a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302010": "Surprisingly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302011": "We've been out together a lot lately...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302012": "So, it's not that surprising, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302013": "Just a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302014": "Since you're already here with me now, how about thinking about me more?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302015": "Is that what you want?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302016": "But you're not as great as Her Majesty...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302017": "Hey, hey!",

  "str_quest_chat01_29302020": "It's kinda illogical for me to think about you, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302021": "Pardon my curiosity, but what exactly were you thinking about me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302022": "The way you looked like when you fell off a tree head down...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302023": "And how you gasped for air after only a couple of steps running... stuff like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302024": "... You mean all embarrassing moments for me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29302025": "You feel embarrassed? Well, I find those moments kinda adorable.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29303004": "Whose are they? What's going on? Where?",

  "str_quest_chat01_29341006": "I'll make improvements where necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341007": "Well, I'll just be upfront then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341008": "There is not a single snowflake in sight...",

  "str_quest_chat01_29341014": "Even though we've got no place to hide...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341015": "Neither do our enemies!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341016": "?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341017": "Makes sense...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341018": "Is this what they call outsiders' wisdom?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341019": "Lesson learned.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341020": "Plus, everyone on the Colossus is on the same team.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341021": "Nobody's going to lay a finger on you anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341022": "Feel free to kick back and enjoy your new life!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341023": "You don't need to conceal yourself here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341024": "Maybe you can try to live a new life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341025": "New life, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341026": "Good, sounds like a worthy challenge!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341027": "Haha, if you ever run into difficulties during the challenge...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29341028": "Feel free to come back and ask for my help!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342001": "I went head-to-head with that killer bear...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342002": "After a day and a night of hard fighting...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342003": "Now, it's down at my feet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342004": "Even Granny wouldn't have dared to challenge it back then!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342005": "Good heavens!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342006": "At this time of year...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342007": "Bears are just waking up from their hibernation...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342008": "Isn't this the time when they're most ferocious?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342009": "Good, you remembered what I told you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342010": "All this time we've spent together wasn't for nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342011": "I've learned a lot during our travels too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342012": "A prey like this...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342013": "It's something I wouldn't dare to challenge even in my dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342014": "I'm not sure when...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342015": "Your audacity has infected me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342016": "Please call it \"bravery and courage\"!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342017": "Yup. That's exactly what I meant.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342018": "But they slipped my mind somehow...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342019": "Anyway, inspire me more with your good qualities in the future!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29342020": "Likewise!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343001": "Wake up yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343002": "Why are you still sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343003": "Just look at the clock...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343004": "It's still bedtime, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343005": "Oh, really? My bad. I didn't notice it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343006": "But I've run ten laps around the mountain already.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343007": "... How come you're so spirited all the time?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343008": "Not sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343009": "Feels like I've got so much energy to spare lately.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343010": "Running alone isn't cutting it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343011": "So I've been training foxes for hunting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343012": "Now, everyone's flat out...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343013": "Can't even shake them awake.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343014": "Spare those poor foxes!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343015": "... And spare me too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343016": "Hold on!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343017": "Does this mean I've got stronger?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343018": "Does it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343019": "Congratulations...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343020": "Get up! Let me piggyback you and run!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343021": "I'm getting stronger so quickly...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343022": "... that my past training intensity just can't keep up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29343023": "That's why I asked you to spare me too...!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344002": "What does it feel like to possess strength?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344003": "Haha, I think you'd have to find answers for that yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344004": "As you know, strength isn't my forte.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344005": "But I can feel the strength has been growing in me lately...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344006": "Meanwhile, evil thoughts have arisen in me as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344007": "Evil thoughts?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344008": "Towards anything that trespasses our territory...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344009": "I've been losing my restraint and caution.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344010": "All I want to do is smash them with absolute strength.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344011": "Simply because I can.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344012": "This feeling... it's terrifying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344013": "Just think about Her Majesty the Queen.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344014": "The mindset that allows her to coexist with her power...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344015": "You can surely get courage from that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344016": "Then think about me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344017": "If you act on impulse...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344018": "And end up hurting someone as defenseless as me, a kind person...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344019": "The regret might consume you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344020": "Oh... Yes, you're right!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344021": "With this mindset, I do feel a lot calmer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344022": "That's really good to hear.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344023": "I clearly feel that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29344024": "I just did the world a favor...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351001": "Right after I woke up in the morning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351002": "I found the heavy snow brought down the tree by my doorstep!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351003": "Now my door is totally blocked by its thick trunk...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351004": "Ohh... What's your plan now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351005": "Can you still get out?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351006": "No biggie.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351007": "What do you think windows are for?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351008": "Well, for me, they're for ventilation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351009": "But in places you're from, they're obviously more...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351010": "... multi-functional.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351011": "Hiya...!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351012": "I shoved the tree aside!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351013": "Now the front door is passable again!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351014": "Looks like even your morning exercises are more...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351015": "... unique as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351016": "A land full of charm, really!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29351017": "What do we do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352002": "Got the prey! Time to call it a day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352003": "Wow, that's a big catch!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352004": "Lucky morning, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352005": "Huh, this isn't luck, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352006": "You're quite a hard worker.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352007": "It's still before dawn.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352008": "Well, there are no bad hunters, just lazy ones.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352009": "I've been scoping it out for days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352010": "This big thing swings by here every morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352011": "Before the dawn breaks, that's when it hunts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352012": "You know what they say, \"Early bird gets the worm.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352013": "Bet it never thought the hunter would get there even earlier, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352014": "Hah, that's right!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352015": "If you wanna get the early bird's advantage...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352016": "... you gotta consider whether you're the bird or the worm!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29352017": "But how come it sounds so cruel when you put it that way?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353001": "She's here!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353002": "It just happened...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353003": "The Queen has stepped out of the Winter Palace!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353004": "...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353005": "Her Majesty is heading towards the Cedar Market...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353006": "... Having a friendly chat with the squid peddler.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353007": "Stop narrating every detail to me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353008": "It makes me look like a stalker!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353009": "Why? I'm just sharing my joy with you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353010": "Oh, no, Her Majesty is walking down the steps on the east side!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353011": "Someone poured water there earlier this morning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353012": "Her Majesty might slip!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353013": "I gotta hurry!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353014": "Has anyone ever told you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353015": "With what you're doing, you're just like a stalker...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29353016": "Argh... Never mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361001": "Novio saw me having lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361002": "And he handed me an apple.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361003": "Never had an apple like this before!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361004": "What's it like?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361005": "Crunchy yet soft.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361006": "All juicy with each bite, it's super refreshing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361007": "Sounds like an average apple.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361008": "Average?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361009": "Then what were those apples I've been eating since I was little?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361010": "Uh, what were they like?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361011": "Hard and cold, like popsicles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361012": "Couldn't even take a bite if you don't bite hard enough...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361013": "But you might chip a tooth if you bite too hard!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361014": "Sounds like frozen apples, a specialty of Northland!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361015": "I actually bought some during my visit there...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361016": "Who in their right mind would want to eat apples like that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361017": "Tourists must be out of their minds.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361018": "Average apples taste much better...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361019": "Well, next time you come to the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29361020": "I'll get you a whole basket of it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362001": "The kids are skiing on the mountain.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362002": "I'd love to go too...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362003": "Why not?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362004": "What's stopping you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362005": "Her Majesty's not back at the palace yet!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362006": "I gotta protect her.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362007": "Can't just bail on my duty!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362008": "True, makes sense.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362009": "Well, next time I'm in Northland...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362010": "Can you teach me how to ski?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362011": "You're kidding, you can't ski?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362012": "You have no idea what fun you're missing out on!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362013": "The speed, the wind...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362014": "And all the falling to the ground...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362015": "You'll be fine with me teaching you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362016": "Come here sooner!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362017": "The snow's not gonna wait for you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29362018": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363001": "The snow-covered pine trees...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363002": "... under the bright sun...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363003": "... look just like creamy cakes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363004": "That sounds lovely.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363005": "You had some creamy cakes lately, didn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363006": "What a vivid metaphor.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363007": "Now I'm craving some creamy cakes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363008": "Last night, I was on guard duty for Her Majesty at the banquet...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363009": "And there was a cake like that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363010": "Of course, I didn't stare at it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363011": "Nor was I neglecting my duty.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363012": "But somehow...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363013": "The image of it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363014": "It's been on my mind all day...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363015": "Hold on, there's someone at the door.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363016": "... Creamy cake! A whole one!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363017": "Her Majesty sent one to me especially!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363018": "That's awesome...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29363019": "Should I go buy a cake too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381001": "The aurora is breathtaking...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381002": "I know, right!?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381003": "When I first saw it, I was totally blown away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381004": "I can imagine how non-locals feel about it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381005": "After all, even for someone like me, who has seen it a thousand times...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381006": "... the shock still feels fresh every time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381007": "I'm a bit surprised.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381008": "Didn't expect you to still be captivated by the aurora's beauty.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381009": "Thought you'd been used to seeing it since you were little.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381010": "No two auroras are the same in the world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381011": "So, there's always something new every night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381012": "... Especially when you're sitting atop the snowy pine forest enjoying it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381013": "Wow...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381014": "The view there must be wide, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381015": "It's beyond description.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381016": "You'll have to experience it for yourself.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29381018": "Whoa, guess I gotta start practicing climbing trees right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29381019": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382001": "Nights in Northland's forest are full of dangers...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382002": "W-What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382003": "A cold-blooded hunter, lurking in the forest...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382004": "So the danger means you, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382005": "The hunter waits, with the utmost patience...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382006": "For the nocturnal creatures!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382007": "Wow, that's so thrilling!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382008": "But is it really okay to send messages at times like this?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382009": "Won't it startle the prey?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382010": "Actually, I'm at home right now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382011": "Reading the fairy tale book that Her Majesty gave me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382012": "But I believe I can write a story totally like the ones in the book!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382013": "Hey, how were those lines I just texted you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29382014": "It feels like I'm right there... incredibly immersive...",

  "str_quest_chat01_29383009": "It's not mentioned in the book Her Majesty gave me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29383010": "I suppose it's because the nights in Northland are too cold.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29383014": "Be careful!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29383015": "It's no joke to catch a cold.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29383017": "Just let me know!",

  "str_quest_chat01_29383019": "My heart is already warmed up!",

  "str_quest_chat01_29441005": "Ribbit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501001": "Got news I want to share with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501002": "I took pictures of a very timid, very shy kitten.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501003": "It's been around, but I rarely get a close look.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501004": "How did you manage to take pictures of it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501005": "With a drone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501006": "Drone?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501007": "Drones can reach places many people can't go.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501008": "And it won't spook the animals.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501009": "As long as you're an expert with it, it's easy to find cats.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501010": "This one only took me three days.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501011": "Oh, please don't tell anyone about this...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501012": "I just wanted to share the joy with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29501013": "You are a true cat-lover.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502001": "I hope I haven't been disturbing you the last few days, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502002": "Disturbing me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502003": "Are you referring to the occasional messages you sent in the night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502004": "I'm happy to chat with you, Rachel. It's no bother at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502005": "That's not quite it, even though that's part of it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502006": "Haven't you noticed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502007": "Two drones have been hovering outside your window.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502008": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502009": "Wow, I do see them...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502010": "You seem to be pegged by enemies quite often.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502011": "I hope to prevent it as much as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502012": "So you sent drones to protect me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502013": "Thank you. That is very thoughtful of you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502014": "It's not enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502015": "The drones are still loud enough to be heard when it's quiet at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502016": "But you didn't even notice?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502017": "Your alertness exceeded even the lowest of my expectations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502018": "I will custom-build armed drones to ensure your personal safety.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29502019": "You sure are going the extra mile for me, Rachel...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503001": "Please tell me how you feel about children, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503002": "Why are you asking me that out of the blue?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503003": "Well, it's very important to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503004": "Don't tell me you actually hate kids.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503005": "Absolutely not!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503006": "I find most children to be adorable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503007": "That's wonderful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503008": "So, why do you want to know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503009": "Would you mind meeting my little sister this weekend?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503010": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503011": "She's been pestering me about seeing you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503012": "It's probably because I mentioned you to her one too many times.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503013": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503014": "Uh, was I wrong to do that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29503015": "No, not at all! I'll be happy to meet your sister!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29504001": "I request your assistance, Caelestite One.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29504002": "Please send me the following info: The location for claiming a package sent from Courier Union to the Colossus. Over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29504003": "You got a package waiting for you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29504004": "It's on my way. I'll pick it up and drop it off for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29504005": "That's perfect. Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29504999": "You picked up a package for Rachel, and now drop it off for her.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541001": "Reporting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541002": "I am Rachel, from the Illumina Federation 3rd Legion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541003": "I will be stationed on the Colossus from now on. Pleased to meet you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541004": "Pleased to meet you too! And let's skip the formality.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541005": "Feel free to let me know if there's anything you need.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541006": "As well as anything you feel can be improved.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541007": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541008": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541009": "There is nothing to improve.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541010": "This Colossus is impeccable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541011": "But if you want to get technical...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541012": "The ceiling on the second-floor corridor has a slight leak.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541013": "I will check it again later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541014": "You already did a thorough inspection of the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541015": "Force of habit for an engineer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541016": "If you prefer that I don't, I apologize and it won't happen again.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541017": "No way, I can't thank you fast enough! I was just amazed at how quickly you do things!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29541018": "Well, chalk that up as force of habit for a scout.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542001": "You won't believe where I am right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542002": "What? Is it some place inconceivable? Don't tell me you're...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542003": "Under Philyshy's bed",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542004": "In the Grand Marshal's bathtub",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542005": "What? How absurd is that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542006": "I'm in the headquarters of stray cats.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542007": "What is that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542008": "Where kitties congregate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542009": "It's a place no Aurorian, but cats are able to uncover.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542010": "I followed a lot of stray cats, trying to find it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542011": "But they would lose me halfway through.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542012": "So I practice my stealth hard.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542013": "And finally, this is the day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542014": "Ah, paradise...!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29542015": "Now I'm wondering who I'm talking to on the terminal...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543001": "At last, a breakthrough...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543002": "All three Eagle Hunters are revamped and upgraded.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543003": "That is good news! Congrats, Rachel!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543004": "I know you've been stuck for a long time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543005": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543006": "Upgrading drones is a tough job.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543007": "Even the slightest modification can throw off-speed and stability.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543008": "But it worked out, thanks to the Caelestite technology I learned here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543009": "No problem, though I have very little to do with that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543010": "You pulled it off because you're such a fast learner.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543011": "Don't be modest. I wouldn't have gotten this far without you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543012": "That's why you're the first person I want to tell about the success.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543013": "I look forward to future collaborations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29543014": "Same here!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544001": "Any challenging task you run into, feel free to pass it on to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544002": "Hmm, you usually don't volunteer yourself...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544003": "Are you broke and need money?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544004": "I got better and just want a chance to prove it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544005": "But you are also right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544006": "What? What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544007": "I heard Umbraton got an influx of rare antique badges.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544008": "So I stayed up overnight to convert fifty micro-drones...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544009": "How many?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544010": "And sent them out all over town under surveillance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544011": "At the first light of day, I hit seven antique dealers in a row.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544012": "And found all of the badges.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544013": "Impressive!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544014": "Too bad I only have Illumina vouchers and couldn't buy the badges.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544015": "I see. Don't worry, I can front!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544016": "I'd rather you don't. They cost as much as a condo in Downtown Umbraton, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544017": "Ahem, okay!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544018": "Worry not, I'll find a job suitable for you, Rachel!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29544019": "Thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551002": "It's still early but the line is out to the square already.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551003": "Luckily, I brought a sleeping bag and got in line in the wee hours.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551004": "What kind of exciting event can this be...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551005": "Is it the handshake event with Alleywood superstars?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551006": "Handshake event?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551007": "Is the Grand Marshal doing that? And what is Alleywood?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551008": "I see you're privy to a lot of information than I am!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551009": "Would you mind telling me more?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551010": "Wait, where are you exactly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551011": "A military collectibles auction.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29551012": "I see!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552001": "Reporting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552002": "This morning's drill was a failure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552003": "You could fail a morning drill? Did you sprain an ankle?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552004": "I'm above such rookie mistakes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552005": "I was spotted by Officer Hiiro.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552006": "What's the big deal about that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552007": "I'd change routes every morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552008": "So I could train and practice my stealth at the same time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552009": "This objective is to traverse the field quickly without exposing my tracks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552010": "But who knew that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552011": "Ah, I get it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552012": "You ran across Hiiro on patrol, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552013": "Yes. I'm still not in Officer Hiiro's league.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552014": "So, how about I do drills around the Grand Marshal's home next time to hone my skills?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29552015": "Stop!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553001": "Oh.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553002": "The breakfast bar melted.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553003": "What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553004": "I remembered this morning that today is the birthday of a team member.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553005": "I sprinted three miles to buy a gift.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553006": "But I forgot there's an energy bar in my pocket.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553007": "This is fate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553008": "It's trying to remind you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553009": "To ditch the bar for something better!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553010": "Don't just look after other people.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553011": "Treat yourself once in a while.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553012": "Right...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553013": "Since you put it that way, Caelestite One...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29553014": "I'll go to the cafe today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29561001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29561002": "It's only midday and the cats have all gone into hiding.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29561003": "Cats are nocturnal animals.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29561004": "True, but I've been trying for a while now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29561005": "With no luck rubbing the soft belly of a cat, so I'm a little bummed out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29561006": "Let me think... There is a kitten that comes out when the sun's setting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29561007": "Must I wait till then...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29561008": "Say, what do you think Officer Philyshy is doing right now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29561009": "I have a bad suspicion about where you're going with this...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562001": "I wanted to see my little sister so I dropped by the house.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562002": "Too bad she was taking an afternoon nap.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562003": "She's still a kid and needs her sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562004": "You're right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562005": "I'll try again when I get off work at seven.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562006": "On second thought, she's probably asleep by seven.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562007": "She goes to bed that early?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562008": "Early to bed, early to rise is good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562009": "But you're shocked by that... Is it because you're late to bed all the time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562010": "Didn't Soroz raise you right when you were little?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29562011": "My bad, I'll never talk about your sister again!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563001": "Afternoons remind me of...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563002": "Afternoon tea, snacks, reading a book!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563003": "It is weird to make that kind of connection.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563004": "Usually, you should be thinking about solar panels.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563005": "No, you're weird to make that connection!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563006": "Now is when the sun is at its most intense.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563007": "And that should be harnessed and capitalized.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563008": "I plan to try out the new drone. Would you like to see it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563009": "A hot sun just makes me want to curl up indoors.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563010": "Oh, by the way...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563011": "I left snacks for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563012": "Thank you. Give me two hours.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563013": "A kitten got lost and wandered into the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563014": "Really?! Keep your eyes on it and I'll be right there!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29563015": "I'll wait.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29581001": "It's always so pleasant to draft blueprints at night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29581002": "Are you still working, Rachel?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29581003": "I feel ashamed that I'm already in bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29581004": "Don't be. Early to bed, early to rise, it is good for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29581005": "I was in bed myself but got hit with inspiration.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29581006": "A new solution to an old problem came to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29581007": "So you jumped out of bed and ran straight for the workstation?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29581008": "I didn't figure there would be an impetuous side to you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29581009": "I'm ashamed to admit that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29581010": "It's all right. Taking immediate action is good for you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582001": "When I gaze at the stars deep into the night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582002": "I'd realize just how insignificant we are.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582003": "But no matter how insignificant, we can still find our own place in the universe.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582004": "True, but what brought this on all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582005": "Nothing, I just get to see the stars so rarely.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582006": "What happened to you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582007": "When I got home, I noticed the bedroom windows weren't closed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582008": "Three, maybe five kittens...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582009": "They were sleeping on my bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582010": "I don't want to take a chance and disturb them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29582011": "So you basically kicked yourself out for them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583001": "Thank you for the suggestions you gave me, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583002": "I bought my aunt a fantastic present for her birthday.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583003": "Well, I just happened to...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583004": "Know my way around Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583005": "And that's exactly what helped me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583006": "I always get nervous when I'm alone in a bustling city.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583007": "Have experience with giving gifts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583008": "That I can tell. You have a knack for picking out the right presents.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583009": "It also requires a good imagination.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583010": "Feel free to give me a call next time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583011": "Speaking of which, when is your birthday?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583012": "My birthday?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29583013": "That's not something worth putting on a calendar.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601001": "I knew I was right, Last Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601002": "You carried the same destiny as I do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601003": "Destiny?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601004": "Yes, though you probably have not realized it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601005": "But whenever I see you, my right hand would throb in pain.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601006": "Do you need to see a doctor?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601007": "Is this a role-playing game?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601008": "No, fool, this is not the time for you to speak in such a manner!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601009": "Anyway, I will continue to observe you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601010": "Whether you are qualified for the Warrior Squad...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29601011": "Will be determined through my eyes!",

  "str_quest_chat01_29601015": "How could you say that? How about I promise you...",

  "str_quest_chat01_29602010": "Listen up, your test is...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29602011": "Scale mountains, cross the sea, and follow the raging river.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29603001": "Come to the Rec Room quickly, Last Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29603002": "I have a spot for you on a very important project!",

  "str_quest_chat01_29641009": "Why do I get the feeling you don't believe me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29641010": "A true warrior will conquer it for sure.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29641011": "You're absolutely right, Last Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29641012": "Just you wait. I will control The Howl of Eternal Night!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29642001": "I think I'm starting to master The Howl of Eternal Night.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29642006": "Without them, I couldn't have done it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29642007": "Yes, I am feeling exceptionally good right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29642008": "It will be a decisive victory if I take on that fellow right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29642009": "That fellow?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29642010": "You know, the demon king's minion? The demon girl who tricked everybody?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29642011": "You mean Azure?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29642012": "Who else can it be?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29642013": "Even though she's been refusing my challenge out of the fear for my warrior righteousness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29642014": "But this time, I will show her my prowess!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29642015": "I'm off now. Just wait for my triumphant return!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29651001": "Good day, Last Caelestite.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29651004": "What are you talking about? What burning object?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29651005": "The sun! I am referring to the sun!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29651006": "You speak too obtusely for mortals to decipher.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29651007": "Yes, maybe sun is a term more familiar to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29651008": "Anyway, get out of bed now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29651009": "And immerse in the bliss of the sun that provides the fourth essential.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29651010": "What is the fourth essential?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29651011": "Vitamin D!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652001": "Something's wrong, Last Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652003": "Stay calm, Zeta the Warrior.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652004": "Khrubet Ashena has disappeared!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652005": "I'm guessing that's the name of your robot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652006": "Isn't that a great name? I came up with it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652007": "Wait, now is not the time for that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652008": "I don't remember whether it was sugar or something else I put in last night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652009": "What's wrong? I thought I heard something in your room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652010": "I have good news and bad news.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652011": "The good news is I found Khrubet Ashena. It is in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652012": "The bad news is... it was a bomb I put inside it last night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652013": "Oh, it's too early in the morning for me to deal with that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29652014": "I have to go clean up the room.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661001": "It is time to replenish, Last Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661002": "One cannot save the world on an empty stomach.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661003": "Therefore, make your choice!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661004": "Which is it, the date curry or the sweet miso soup?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661005": "Uh, the date curry, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661006": "If I had to pick one, give me sweet miso soup.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661007": "What? That is my choice too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661008": "This is not good. The demon king probably anticipated it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661009": "It would be unfortunate if he sent his favorite minion in advance to poison your meal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661010": "So choose the other, Last Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29661011": "And let Zeta the Warrior make the ultimate sacrifice!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29662001": "The moment has finally come, Last Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29662002": "Time to take the legendary secret formula!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29662003": "Secret formula? What secret formula?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29662004": "What formula could you only take at noon time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29662005": "The sacred royal toffee, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29662006": "It is the limited edition for this year from the most popular shop in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29662007": "But why can you only eat it at noon?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29662008": "Because you cannot gain weight that way.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29662009": "In order to save the world, even warriors must watch their calories.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29663001": "Hmm, I did not expect the enemy to be so tough this time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29663002": "Even the sun at its apex cannot defeat it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29663003": "What enemy are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29663004": "A candy called jawbreakers!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29663005": "It is allegedly the hardest candy in the world, tough as a rock.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29663006": "It will take eight years to melt in your mouth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29663007": "I had hoped it would melt under the sun's intense heat, but to no avail.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29663008": "That is indeed a problem...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29663009": "You will see, for the honor of Zeta the Warrior!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29663010": "I shall shatter its defenses!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681001": "Zeta requires your assistance, Last Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681002": "Come to my room immediately, for I am unable to speak!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681003": "Now? It's dark out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681004": "What happened? Is something wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681005": "I chewed 40 bubblegum.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681006": "And blew a giant bubble of epic proportions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681007": "But I cannot take pictures of it or call for help.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681008": "Anyway, you got to come quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681009": "Oops, never mind. It burst.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681010": "Oh.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681011": "Eww, it's sticky everywhere.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29681012": "I guess this is fate's way of testing the leading lady's tenacity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682001": "The sun has finally set, Last Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682002": "Those fellows will probably make their move soon!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682003": "Those fellows?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682004": "Minions of the evil god Arnoldius!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682005": "But I feel so sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682006": "Be on your guard and watch out for Arnoldius' minions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682007": "Anyway, we both must be extra vigilant tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682008": "Do not fall asleep, or Arnoldius will take control of you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682009": "I've taken many coffee candy to prepare me for the long night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682010": "Is that why you can't fall asleep now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682011": "Oh, I'm too hyped to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29682012": "Hang out with me because I'm so bored!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701001": "Do you have a favorite type of game?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701002": "Hmm, I can't really pick one...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701003": "It's comparative... You must pick one!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701004": "A leisurely management game?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701005": "A game with lots of battles?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701006": "Hmm, I understand now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701007": "Why did you bring this up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701008": "Are you preparing a gift for me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701009": "How did you guess it so quickly...?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701010": "No, it's not a surprise now...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701011": "I need to make more preparations...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701012": "Don't bother. Just pretend that I didn't guess the answer!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701013": "I would love anything you give me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29701014": "Batia? Are you still there?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702001": "Hello ?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702002": "Ah! No, I'm sorry. I pressed that by mistake.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702003": "Can't this be recalled?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702004": "Don't panic. It's not a big deal even if you can't recall it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702005": "Thank You ...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702006": "Can you tell me what you were thinking of doing?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702007": "I was struggling while looking at your avatar.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702008": "Huh ?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702009": "I've always controlled two characters in the game by myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702010": "It's been so long since we met, and we've played so many two-player games together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702011": "Playing games with a partner makes me feel incredibly happy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702012": "I want... share these feelings I've experienced with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702013": "Same here! It's all because you've introduced so many games to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702014": "So, there's no need to be so formal. We've been partners for so long already!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702015": "Did that come out a little awkward?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29702016": "Batia? Batia?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29703001": "PlayerName... is it possible that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29703002": "In addition to being completely useless, could I have been a villain in the past?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29703003": "Huh? Why would you think that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29703004": "But... even the game is telling me that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29703005": "Can you meet me in the Rec Room?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29703999": "Batia seems pretty anxious. Let's go to the Rec Room to find her right away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29741001": "Hello ?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29741002": "It's my first time using this to chat with others.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29741003": "Hello... um... I've already introduced myself before... Nice to meet you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29741004": "Hi there!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29741005": "Relax! Everyone is really nice here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29741006": "You've triggered a special dialogue with the friendly faction!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29741007": "Welcome! I'm the \"Legendary Caelestite\" and the \"Master of the Colossus\"!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29741008": "I chose a style that matches you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29741009": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29741010": "Anyway, come to me whenever you want to play games!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743001": "I can feel myself improving every day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743002": "Maybe I'm ready to challenge Gronru again now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743003": "Haven't you already beaten Gronru before?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743004": "Only in Tetrablox or when she isn't feeling well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743005": "Gronru's field of study is so extensive. I can't compare to her.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743006": "... That's what I used to think.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743007": "But you've actually helped me try many new things too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743008": "Perhaps I can overcome my fear of her and challenge her more often now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743009": "That sounds like a lot of effort.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743010": "Shall we challenge her together?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743011": "You should just watch for now. I can't keep troubling you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743012": "I need to show you how I've changed too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29743013": "In that case... Go for it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744001": "You have to tell me if you have any trouble with a stage...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744002": "You've always been looking out for me, and I want to help you too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744003": "I might be a good-for-nothing game addict.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744004": "But you've told me that there are things I can do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744005": "I feel really happy that you think that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744006": "I don't need anything right now, Batia. There's no rush.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744007": "You acknowledge games, enjoy games, and always encourage me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744008": "I have to repay you for everything you've done!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744009": "Well ...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744010": "Can you write me a walkthrough for Mushroom Hero?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744011": "I heard it's one of your favorite games...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744012": "No problem. Just leave it to me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744013": "I swear by the time I've spent playing Mushroom Hero that I'll definitely help you become a super mushroom!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744014": "It's good that you're motivated, but I just want to collect all the mushrooms...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744015": "I've discovered something that only I can do!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744016": "I... want to take this opportunity to be brave...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29744017": "I can definitely clear the game without losing a life in Astra!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29751001": "Good night. *yawns*",

  "str_quest_chat01_29751006": "Are you also off to bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29751007": "Would you like to join me online... I'm playing a game in which you earn points by sleeping...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29751008": "But I just got up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29751009": "Good night, I'm off to earn some points—",
  "str_quest_chat01_29751010": "Uh... Good luck and good dreams then...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29752001": "The sunlight... it's unbearable. Is there a way to become more resistant to it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29752002": "What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29752003": "The game I got recently doesn't seem very compatible with me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29752004": "It needs to be charged with sunlight to maximize the character's performance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29752005": "But it's hard for me to charge it with the sun every day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29752006": "Maybe you can ask someone to charge it for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29752007": "No way! I have to do it myself. Every little bit counts...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29752008": "Even if it's just a little... I wish you could give me some of your determination for facing the early morning...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29761001": "This time of the day is when I feel the most tired...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29761002": "But I insist on coming to greet you, and here I am.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29761003": "You shouldn't force yourself. Just rest as usual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29761004": "No, if I do that, the sign-in will be interrupted...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29761005": "Sign-in? What do you mean by that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29761006": "Our Affinity might also drop...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29761007": "Hello? Are we still on the same page?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29781001": "I'm up. It's so quiet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29781002": "Many people go to bed around this time, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29781003": "Speaking of which, what did you do in the past when you needed to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29781004": "Umbraton can be considered a city of the night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29781005": "It has a well-developed night market delivery service.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29782003": "It's almost time for bed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29782004": "What a pity... So, do you prefer the red warrior or the blue warrior?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29782005": "The red warrior.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29782006": "Eh, but the red warrior is usually player two.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29782007": "The blue warrior.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29782008": "I thought so. You're player one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29782009": "It seems that player one is the blue warrior and player two is the red warrior in all games.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29782011": "Those who prefer to be player one tend to be more assertive, while those who prefer to be player two are usually more passive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29782012": "I think you're more like the protagonist, so you should be player one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29782013": "But I'm not blue, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29782014": "Hmm... Since all games are like this, maybe you should wear blue too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29782015": "I don't think this is a reason to change what I'm wearing...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29783001": "Do you play games late at night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29783002": "It's very quiet, and I really like this feeling.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29783003": "I can explore and play the game peacefully in my own world and experience the creators' passion to the fullest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29783004": "Many other thoughts and feelings are swirling in my mind...",

  "str_quest_chat01_29783008": "I used to want to interact with other players because I would feel a little empty inside after finishing a game.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29801007": "So... what made you want to remind me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29801008": "Hehe... Last night, I wandered through the mountains, lost in thought.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29801009": "And before I knew it, dawn was breaking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29801010": "The golden sunlight lit up the thick fog, spreading through the forest...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29801011": "It was like a divine revelation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29801012": "I really wanted to share that moment with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29801013": "But then it occurred to me that if you were actually here...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29801014": "You'd likely be shivering and sniffling from the cold.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29801015": "Is that how you think of me? Some kind of dork?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29801016": "Quite the opposite, PlayerName.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29802002": "When you say \"the past,\" how long ago are we talking?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802003": "Far longer ago than you imagine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802004": "Back then, I was living in Varaki Town.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802005": "My mother used to take a walk in the garden on bright mornings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802006": "I'd always watch her silently from the big window.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29802012": "Lady Victoria...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802013": "It's rare to hear you talk about such everyday moments.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802014": "I'm not sure whether to feel relieved... or worried.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802015": "Seeing you so troubled...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802016": "I think I should probably talk more about the past with you in the future.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29802018": "Mother's busy figure in the garden...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802019": "That scene is the perfect epitome of everyday life's sweetness and sadness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802020": "And I had a hunch long ago...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802021": "That I'd get past all of that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802022": "Everything that Mother's figure stands for...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29802023": "You're finally back to your usual self.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29803015": "So you actually like it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29803016": "And you're just concerned about my feelings, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29803017": "Well... um...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29803018": "Heh... Thanks a lot, I mean it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29803019": "Immortality's a curse.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29803020": "It's full of memories that I can't choose to forget.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29803021": "But that's my mission, so I choose to embrace everything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29803022": "This is precisely why I can understand this book...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29803023": "Seeing its romance and enlightenment.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29803024": "Enlightenment?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29803025": "If I were really a blood-sucking monster, it wouldn't be so bad.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29842004": "I wasn't aware it actually had a \"personality\"...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29842005": "It's always been arrogant and taunting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29842006": "And it's gotten even worse recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29842007": "I was just thinking about the prophecy it revealed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29842008": "It actually asked me, \"Need a translation for it?\"",

  "str_quest_chat01_29842015": "...Nope, thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843001": "After acquiring the Blood Thorn...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843002": "I started training with a sword.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843003": "And it went surprisingly well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843004": "Fantastic! How did you manage that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843005": "It's quite simple, actually. On your Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843006": "There are Aurorians skilled in various weapons.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843007": "And Truth has many dimensions. On the flip side...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843008": "The more dimensions you see, the closer you get to the one and only Truth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843009": "From the many to the one, then from the one to the sword.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843010": "Do you get what I'm saying?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843011": "You observe how different weapons are handled...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843012": "And gain insights into their use.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843013": "Then, you apply those insights to your sword training.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843014": "That's what you mean, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29843015": "You're sharp—I knew I wasn't wrong about you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29844001": "Even though I realized it early on, I still find myself deeply impressed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29844002": "Self-improvement is always a way to seek the Truth.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29844003": "You know what impressed me more?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29844004": "You're getting so powerful that you're almost becoming the Truth himself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29844005": "He is above all of us, so...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29844006": "I'm not worthy of such praise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29844007": "But He does manifest in every one of us.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29844008": "So, your remark is quite insightful.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29844010": "He manifests in everyone... Does that include me as well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29844011": "Of course. Just try to feel it if you have doubts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29844012": "No, no, that's not necessary... I totally believe!",

  "str_quest_chat01_29852001": "Mornings are quite fascinating, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852002": "You mean... like what to eat for breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852003": "Every morning, Aurorians awaken from their sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852004": "They clear their minds and bond with each other...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852005": "Forming the immense web called \"society\"...",

  "str_quest_chat01_29852008": "You don't think it actually is?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852009": "It depends on your perspective.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852010": "Indeed, the web called society is strong and solid.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852011": "But to connect with anything...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852012": "You need to up a part of yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852013": "And that distances us from true insight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852014": "So... sometimes, it feels lonelier in a crowd.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852015": "I think I get what you're saying.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852016": "You're pretty sharp and wise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852017": "For breakfast, I'd suggest the smoked salmon bagel.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29852018": "Sounds good!",
  "str_quest_chat01_29853001": "Do you like the Nectar of Life I gave you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29853002": "I love it.",

  "str_quest_chat01_29853011": "I thought I had a deep understanding of it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_29853012": "But now I still can't help but feel amazed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29853013": "Wh-What do you mean by that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_29853014": "Unlike you, I am very fond of the Nectar of Life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29853015": "Especially love taking a few sips in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_29853016": "It always gives me the rest of a deep sleep.",

  "str_quest_chat01_30042008": "Actually, I got curious and tried to hypnotize you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30042009": "Maybe it's your Caelestite nature that thwarted my attempt.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30042010": "When was that?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_30042011": "Don't make a fuss; let's talk about it next time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30042012": "Uh, this isn't something to save for later!",

  "str_quest_chat01_30044003": "No, never mind. Oh, by the way, keep applying yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044004": "In the endless flow of time, I still strive forward.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044005": "You need to follow my example and motivate yourself too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044006": "Mr. Wilhelm, are you suggesting I exercise more?",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044007": "No, given your frame, exercising won't do anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044008": "But there is a hidden power in your melon head.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044009": "Cherish your talent, and don't waste it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044010": "Uh, your words are a bit hard to grasp... Mr. Wilhelm.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044011": "Just now, when I walked by your window...",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044012": "I tried to hypnotize you and erase your memory of seeing me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044013": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044014": "Looks like my training has paid off, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044015": "Like I said from the beginning, I have always strived to improve.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044016": "I'll exercise my mind, and this won't happen again!",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044017": "Are you upset? But I won't apologize.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044018": "Go practice, young one... while you have lots of time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30044019": "I'll start right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_30051001": "Roses in the morning are always particularly beautiful.",

  "str_quest_chat01_30051003": "Huh? Last time when I looked up the Rose Encyclopedia...",
  "str_quest_chat01_30051004": "They didn't exhibit that trait.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30051005": "Roses favor coolness so they bloom more in the morning than at noon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30051006": "I believe this is a more reasonable explanation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30051007": "...I didn't think you'd be so rational.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30051008": "Same here. I didn't expect you to be so sentimental.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30051009": "I do read poetry collections, but...",
  "str_quest_chat01_30051010": "A member of the family of vampire reading poetry? We already have Charon, and that's enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30051011": "I couldn't agree more...",
  "str_quest_chat01_30052001": "It's starting to get noisy...",
  "str_quest_chat01_30052002": "Have you ever noticed the birds chirping in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat01_30052003": "Yes, I have.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30052004": "Usually after an all-nighter...",
  "str_quest_chat01_30052005": "When I fall asleep to the birds chirping.",

  "str_quest_chat01_30053011": "4 AM! That should make up for it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_30053012": "The sunrise isn't the most impressive sight today.",

  "str_quest_chat01_30061003": "Hearing that, I'm positive someone has got sunstroke, but it's definitely not me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30061004": "Just kidding, sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat01_30061005": "Under the blazing sun, all secrets come to light. Don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_30061006": "It takes away some of the thrill of exploration.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30061007": "Maybe that's just because you're not a fan of sunlight...",
  "str_quest_chat01_30061008": "The bright sunlight dispels every shadow.",

  "str_quest_chat01_30061011": "The searing heat makes it hard to think.",
  "str_quest_chat01_30061012": "Obviously, the sun distances us from true insight.",

  "str_quest_chat01_50201003": "Huh, there are alchemists in our world too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50201004": "You met one?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50201005": "I'm talking about you!",

  "str_quest_chat01_50201009": "Thank you, Ryza!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50201010": "So let's all have a big party!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50203001": "Emergency, I need help!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50203002": "What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50203003": "Can you come to the workshop? The sooner, the better!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50203999": "The \"workshop\" Ryza mentioned probably refers to her room on the Colossus. Go check it out now!",

  "str_quest_chat01_50241005": "Oh, but it hasn't seen me doing alchemy yet, has it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50241006": "It gives off weird smells sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50241007": "Will that be a problem?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50241008": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50241009": "Maybe I should hold things back a bit on the Colossus...",

  "str_quest_chat01_50241013": "You wouldn't believe how many weird folks have done weird things here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50241014": "Instead, I should ask you not to mind them...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50241015": "Weird folks doing weird things... I can take a hint, buddy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50241016": "You've gone one step too far!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242001": "Remarkable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242002": "I've lost count of how many days and sleepless nights this process has taken...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242003": "We're stumbling upon more and more formulas as we go...",

  "str_quest_chat01_50242007": "I did sleep! But it would be great if I had more time for alchemy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242008": "Does the fact you're discovering more and more formulas mean...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242009": "You can make more items?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242010": "That's right, and we can create things that are only possible in this world!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242011": "When you think about it this way, I'm pretty impressive, aren't I?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242012": "But adventuring with you really sparks inspiration.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242013": "All those crashes, impacts, and sinkings...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242014": "They're all brand-new experiences for me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50242015": "Ha, haha... Glad to know that's helpful to you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261001": "Hi, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261002": "I found a new kind of flower this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261003": "I thought it might make great alchemy material! But...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261004": "When I got back just now, they were all gone!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261005": "Could they be wild vegetables? Did someone pick them for cooking?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261006": "What kind of flowers are they? Where did you see them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261007": "In the woods we went to last time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261008": "You know, those small, blue flowers.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261009": "Ha... Haha...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261010": "Those flowers are definitely inedible, or else the consequences could be severe...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261011": "I remember they don't like sunlight, so they're probably closed by now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261012": "You can go look again at dusk.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261013": "I see! Good thing I asked you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261014": "But how do you know so much about them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261015": "One day, Vice dragged me to pick some \"wild vegetables\" for soup...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50261016": "No need to say more! I get it now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281001": "I lost track of time again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281002": "Are you working on alchemy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281003": "Yep! Astra is packed with materials I've never seen...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281004": "Gotta study them all ASAP!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281005": "Don't forget to take breaks!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281006": "Ever since I got to Astra, I feel like I'm becoming Tao...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281007": "I get lost in researching new materials every day...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281008": "Nothing else gets my attention.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281009": "No wonder you're a top-notch alchemist.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281010": "Your passion is unmatched.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281011": "Besides that, your stamina is just as impressive...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281012": "My stamina?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281013": "You can stir that big cauldron all day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281014": "If it were me, I'd be dead tired...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50281015": "Teehee... That's the basics for a farm girl!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282001": "Are you in bed, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282002": "Just got in bed, what's up?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282003": "There's nothing to do. I feel kinda bored...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282004": "You get bored too?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282005": "Why wouldn't I?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282006": "Waiting is key in alchemy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282007": "Like \"let it simmer for five hours.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282008": "Back in the workshop, I had ways to kill time.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282009": "Like reading, or studying recipes for Puni...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282010": "But what can I do to pass the time now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282011": "Maybe... sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282012": "I'm worried the potion will overcook if I sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282013": "No worries. I have to get up early tomorrow anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282014": "Five hours, right? How about I wake you up then?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282015": "Great! I'm counting on you now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50282016": "Time for a good night's sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50303001": "Navigator, I'd like to visit Lumopolis. Would you come with me?",

  "str_quest_chat01_50341004": "Huh, no funny comments about that?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50341005": "About what?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50341006": "The line I just said is from a knight novel I read in Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50341007": "I know it's a bit embarrassing, but I've always wanted to try saying it once...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50341008": "I see. Actually, there are a lot of novel lovers on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50341009": "And there are even more who love quoting cool lines.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50341010": "So I guess I'm used to it now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50341011": "...That's a relief.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342001": "Navigator, I owe you a big thank you.",

  "str_quest_chat01_50342003": "A lot of the credit goes to you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342004": "W-What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342005": "My weapon specializes in hitting enemies' weak points directly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342006": "But before, I only saw their weak points at the combat level.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342007": "With your psychic ability, you can spot weaknesses in both their minds and situations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342008": "Then, you masterfully manipulate information and words for a killer blow!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342009": "Your approach has deeply impressed me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342010": "Hey! What you're saying...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342011": "It sounds like you're describing a supervillain!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342012": "That's nonsense! Supervillains are all mindless monsters.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50342013": "They're nothing like you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381001": "Can't believe it's this late already...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381002": "And the nights of this world are filled with danger.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381003": "The nobles here must bear heavier responsibilities, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381004": "Considering they have to protect the common folk from the Eclipsites.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381005": "Responsibilities aren't really something comparable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381006": "Even a peaceful world has its own set of responsibilities.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381007": "You're also a noble who chooses to undertake this solemn responsibility.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381008": "Just hearing about it gives me a headache.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381009": "Navigator... Thank you for being such a good listener.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381010": "The local nobles are a mixed bunch.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381011": "Not everyone's like you and Carleen...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381012": "Brave and responsible.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381013": "Is that really how you see me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381014": "I'm happy to hear that. My father would be pleased too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381015": "Though he probably wouldn't say it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381016": "You and Carleen... Even your dads are alike...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381017": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50381018": "Nothing, forget it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401001": "PlayerName! I just found out something!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401002": "Hmm. What's the discovery?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401003": "I like you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401004": "I thought we were clear. Please don't say things like this so casually!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401005": "But, you always send me gifts that I like.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401006": "You don't mind my bad memory, and you patiently keep me company.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401007": "Also, you are super kind and cheerful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401008": "Most importantly, I know you are genuine!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401009": "So, I really, really like you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401010": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401011": "Well, I also like you a lot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401012": "For real?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401013": "Innocent, kind, optimistic, and willing to help others.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401014": "So many incredible qualities you have!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401015": "You just made my day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401016": "Feel free to come to me for help, anytime!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50401017": "Thank you. I will!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50402001": "PlayerName, are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50402002": "What about them?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50402003": "I have something very important to tell you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50402004": "Do you have a minute? Please come to the Rec Room!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50402005": "Very important? Sure! But...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50402999": "Clearly, Maya won't be in the Rec Room. With no confidence in her memory, you decide to go to the Cafe instead...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441001": "Wow... Is this your castle, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441002": "So big, and floating in the sky!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441003": "It reminds me of a fairy tale about a sky city!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441004": "Erm... I don't know, has it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441005": "What's the story?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441006": "Uh... I can't remember much of it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441007": "But you and I together will create many new stories!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441008": "That's right. Looking forward to it very much!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441009": "Can't wait!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441010": "Ha-ha. There are so many people here, playing music, reading, and having sweet dreams together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441011": "If my memory fails me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441012": "PlayerName, make sure to remind me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441013": "No problem. I can do that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50441014": "Thank you! You really are a great guy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442001": "PlayerName, can I talk to you about our Ancestor?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442002": "Of course. What exactly do you want to talk about?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442003": "Recently, in my dreams...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442004": "I've been communicating more with our Ancestor!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442005": "He shared with me so many things!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442006": "I'm starting to understand how to weave bubbles.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442007": "Err. Give me a minute to process... You mean...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442008": "You have become more powerful...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442009": "So you can understand your Ancestor's guidance better?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442010": "Something like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442011": "When I played recently, everything remained under control.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442012": "Yes, I won't cause more trouble for everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442013": "There has been no trouble at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442014": "All you have given us are beautiful dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442015": "Thanks for your kind words!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442016": "I will continue to bring sweet dreams for everyone!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442017": "PlayerName, please be my Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442018": "Join the Ancestor in guiding my path!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50442019": "I got you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50451001": "Shiny sun.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50451002": "Yes, it's a lovely day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50451003": "So is my mood!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50451004": "That makes sense. Pleasant weather makes us feel good!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50451005": "PlayerName, you are shining too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50451006": "Huh?! Me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50451007": "I can feel it! You're in high spirits and full of energy!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50451008": "Phew... You got me. Didn't realize we were talking about feelings.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50452001": "Bubble!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50452002": "Bubble... bubble?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50452003": "The world is a giant bubble.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50452004": "You always have fascinating metaphors.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50452005": "Eclipsites are a motley part on the bubble.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50452006": "And you are the most brilliant color out there!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50452007": "Good morning, dazzling PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50452008": "Morning... Eh, have I become a new fairy tale?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50461001": "Feeling lazy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50461002": "It's the siesta hour. You also feel sleepy?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50461003": "Yeah. Are you ready for a sweet afternoon dream?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50461004": "I rarely dream during an afternoon nap...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50461005": "I can help make you one!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50461006": "Ha-ha. Thank you, but that won't be necessary!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50481001": "Did you have a dream?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50481002": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50481003": "I took a nap earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50481004": "Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50481005": "I was just getting ready for bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50481006": "I see. I'm also going to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50481007": "It's time for the world to wake up from its dream again...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50481008": "Yawn... Night...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50481009": "Huh? Is that why you called? Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501001": "It's actually a bit unusual...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501002": "What? What do you mean...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501003": "I've been living a life of anonymity.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501004": "I won't let others understand me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501005": "Not to mention knowing my preferences.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501006": "But now, your understanding of me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501007": "... has surpassed anyone from the past.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501008": "Right...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501009": "Am I getting a little too personal here?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501010": "Oh, I didn't mean that, my apologies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501011": "It's just that I need some time to get used to it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501012": "And I need to know more about you too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501013": "Me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501014": "That's right, if I want to be there every step of the way...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501015": "... I need to know you better.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501016": "I hope you won't mind me contacting you with the terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50501017": "No worries. Chat away. I'm excited to talk to you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50502001": "PlayerName, is there anything I can do?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50502002": "I don't think so...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50502003": "Then... do you need me to supervise you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50502004": "That's also a bit stressful...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50502005": "Could you please come to the Cafe? I'd like to discuss some work-related issues...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50502999": "You arrive at the Cafe with a nervous heart, feeling like you're about to have an interview...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541001": "This is amazing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541002": "Despite my study on Caelestites and the Colossi...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541003": "... standing on an actual Colossus still feels like witnessing history firsthand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541004": "Haha, you should relax a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541005": "Just think of this place as your home.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541006": "Home?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541007": "I have been wandering around various places for my mission.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541008": "There's no specific place for me to call my home.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541009": "It's surreal to think that...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541010": "I might finally have a place to call home.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541011": "If there's anything you need help with, feel free to ask me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541012": "Thank you. I will.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541013": "And if there's any secret you wish to protect, you can tell me too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541014": "We're the best secret keepers, no one can pry into your affairs with me around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50541015": "There aren't that many secrets...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542001": "I feel that I'm getting closer to my long-cherished wish.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542002": "You mean...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542003": "From the emblem of the necklace...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542004": "I will extract my ultimate blade.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542005": "But there's one thing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542006": "I need to know if I'm worth the blade.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542007": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542008": "You've brilliantly fulfilled your mission.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542009": "Yes, I'm no longer as lost as I was before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542010": "But to better protect the people I care about.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542011": "... the things I hold dear...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542012": "... and to continue my fight for justice in the night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542013": "I must become even stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542014": "So... it's not time yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542015": "Yes, until the day I can fully uphold my beliefs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542016": "I will certainly master the Blade of Longinus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542017": "And I want you to be my witness.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50542018": "Of course, I'm also looking forward to that day!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50551001": "Hey, wake up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50551002": "How did you know I was asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50551003": "I just saw you looking listless. Did you stay up late?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50551004": "Yes... I was reading some books about the history.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50551005": "Remember to rest every now and then.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50551006": "... though I'm not the best at it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50551007": "I just hope you take my words for it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50551008": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50552001": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50552002": "Hello, what's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50552003": "Ah, nothing special.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50552004": "I caught some antique smugglers last night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50552005": "Now, I'm about to grab some shut-eye.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50552006": "If I go to the cafeteria later, will there still be food?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50552007": "You call this \"nothing special\"?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50552008": "You were saying it on purpose, weren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50552009": "How about eating before sleeping? I can have the fireflies bring it to you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50552010": "Good idea, thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50561001": "It's so hot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50561002": "It does get quite hot at noon on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50561003": "But the midnight breeze can be quite chilly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50561004": "The blade hidden under the feathers gives off an even stronger chill.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50561005": "You can come to the bridge at midnight to cool off as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50561006": "Was that a murderous look?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50561007": "I choose to sleep soundly in my room!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50581001": "Still awake?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50581002": "Barely...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50581003": "I'm almost asleep...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50581004": "Then, sleep now. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50581005": "My night has just begun.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50581006": "Please don't worry about what needs to be done next.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50581007": "Oh, you're not making me feel any better!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50602001": "PlayerName, was this letter sent successfully?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50602002": "Achilles?! You can use the terminal to communicate now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50602003": "Hmm, I've learned a bit reluctantly. It seems to have been successfully delivered, which is good.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50602004": "Please come to the Lounge, we are all here.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50602999": "Claymore sounds serious. Everyone is gathered together, could there be some major event...?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701001": "Listen to me, listen to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701002": "I discovered a hidden cave behind the waterfall.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701003": "Mysterious lights are twinkling deep within the cave.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701004": "You didn't rush in immediately, did you?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701005": "What are you talking about? I'm not a selfish person!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701006": "Of course, I'm inviting you to join in on the fun!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701007": "No... I mean, it could be dangerous...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701008": "Aren't you going?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701009": "You must bring a helmet, headlamp, protective suit, dry food...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701010": "Water jug, antidote... and a flint!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701011": "Ready. Let's go.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701012": "Hahaha, you're an expert at this.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50701013": "Indeed, I'm right about you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50702001": "Let's take a trip to Lumopolis and show you some fun.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50702002": "I'm waiting for you at the Bridge, hurry up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50702999": "Pepita seems to have come up with a new crazy idea, go to the Bridge and find out.\n",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741001": "There are a lot of interesting people on this Colossus of yours.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741002": "Are they all your friends?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741003": "That's right, everyone is my family and comrades-in-arms.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741004": "Hey! You're in danger now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741005": "My charm is unparalleled.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741006": "Before I knew it, everyone might have been revolving around me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741007": "I'm sorry for taking your friends away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741008": "Looks like you are getting along well with everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741009": "That's impressive. What would you like to eat tonight?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741010": "Humph... You don't mind at all?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741011": "You're my friend too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741012": "... What am I going to do with you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741013": "Then, I suppose I'll get along with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50741014": "I'll be there for you too, Pepita!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742001": "I've become even more impressive!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742002": "Can you believe this? I'm so amazingly strong!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742003": "Congratulations, Pepita!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742004": "With greater power, we can better protect freedom.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742005": "Yeah... You're right, power is very important.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742006": "However, the most important thing in the pursuit of freedom is not strength.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742007": "When those guys had me cornered, I was still a little girl.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742008": "But I, too, ran towards freedom.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742009": "On the contrary, many people from Illumina are clearly healthy and strong...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742010": "Yet they're willing to stay in the Undercity and accept all the orders.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742011": "It's clear that willpower is the most important!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742012": "However, I think that's because everyone has different beliefs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742013": "Just like Pepita is willing to pay the price for her beliefs...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742014": "Others are the same.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742015": "For them, \"freedom\" is that price.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50742016": "Hmm... It's hard to understand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50751001": "You're up too early, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50751002": "And you played video games with me all night yesterday!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50751003": "Isn't that exhausting enough?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50751004": "I am exhausted...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50751005": "But I can't fight my body's natural wake-up call.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50751006": "So it's still not enough.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50751007": "Pepita, you can do better!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50751008": "Why are you torturing me? Please spare me!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50761001": "I want lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50761002": "What should I eat?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50761003": "The legendary Buddha Jumps Over the Wall from Longzhou? Or perhaps the exquisite caviar noodles of Cloud Island?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50761004": "Or maybe the apple stew with meat from Northland?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50761005": "They're all a million miles away from us!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50761006": "Distance can't hinder a heart that yearns for freedom.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50761007": "Whatever Lady Pepita wants to eat, she will definitely get.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50761008": "We'll see about that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50761009": "Huff... Just don't yank me around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50781001": "Off to be a bandit!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50781002": "Is it what I think it means...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50781003": "It's not right to claim others' belongings without permission.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50781004": "That's called a thief, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50781005": "Exactly the criminal act I understand!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50781006": "There are so many things in this world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50781007": "I just occasionally rearrange a few of them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50781008": "What's not good?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50781009": "Don't try to implant your twisted logic into my head...",
  "str_quest_chat01_50782001": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50782002": "You asleep yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50782003": "Let's go out and enjoy the nightlife to the fullest!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50782004": "But I've already changed into my pajamas.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50782005": "What now?",
  "str_quest_chat01_50782006": "As long as I'm happy, pajamas are my evening gown.",
  "str_quest_chat01_50782007": "It could also be my dance costume, battle outfit, or swimsuit!",
  "str_quest_chat01_50782008": "Just let it be pajamas...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101001": "Are you familiar with the scent of begonias?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101002": "I am!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101003": "They smell kind of sweet and fragrant, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101004": "I'm not.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101005": "But I imagine begonias are probably really fragrant, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101006": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101007": "Most begonias actually have no fragrance.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101008": "And those that do only have the faintest of aromas.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101009": "Begonias bloom in silence, and never compete against other more fragrant flowers in the spring.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101010": "This is one of the reasons why I like them so much.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101011": "When you describe them like that, it makes me want to see them bloom too.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101012": "A simple request.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60101013": "When the begonias are next in bloom, I would be happy to take you to see them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102001": "Are you available, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102002": "Oh, hey, Dantang, you need something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102003": "Am I not allowed to speak to you unless I have something to discuss?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102004": "O-Of course you're allowed!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102005": "Heheh, I was only joking just now. I meant no offense.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102006": "However, there is something I wish to discuss with you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102007": "May I please know your measurements?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102008": "My measurements?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102009": "Yes, such as your height, your shoulder and chest width, your waist circumference... Those measurements.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102010": "Why are you asking for those?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102011": "I've noticed that you only seem to wear a single set of clothing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102012": "So I thought I would have a Longzhou-style outfit tailored for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102013": "Actually, I have lots of different sets of clothes. They just all look similar...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102014": "I see. It appears I was mistaken.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102015": "Then we'll just have to wait until we return to my homeland...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60102016": "And I'll have that outfit tailored for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103001": "Do you have anyone whom you miss dearly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103002": "I do. In fact, I feel that way about a lot of my friends.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103003": "I see. I have yet to make as many close friends as you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103004": "The only two people in my heart who I dearly miss are my two sisters.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103005": "I hope they've been well these last few years...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103006": "If I was your sister, I wouldn't want you to be so worried about me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103007": "... Hmm?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103008": "If I were your sister, I would definitely want you to live your life well...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103009": "So that when we finally see each other again, we have plenty of fun and interesting stories to tell.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103010": "Oh, PlayerName, I always knew you were a thoughtful and caring person.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103011": "When I see my sisters again, I'll be sure to tell them all about you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103012": "Hahaha! Just try not to share anything too embarrassing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103013": "But if that day truly comes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60103014": "When I finally return to my homeland, I will surely miss you dearly as well, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60104001": "How are you, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60104002": "Oh, hey Dantang.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60104003": "I'm doing well. Do you need something?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60104004": "Jiu came across an interesting novel in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60104005": "Would you like to come and see it for yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60104006": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60104007": "Then let's meet on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60104999": "Just how interesting is that novel Dantang mentioned? Go to the Bridge and find out!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141001": "I was told you were searching for noble compatriots, and that your Colossus housed many such guests.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141002": "It seems the rumors were true after all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141003": "Now that I'm here, may I be considered one of your guests as well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141004": "Should you require my assistance, I'll do everything in my power to help you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141005": "Thank you, Princess Zhuohua!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141006": "As I've said many times before, please do not address me by that title.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141007": "Thank you... Dantang.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141008": "But the people on the Colossus aren't just my guests. They're my friends too!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141009": "Then does that mean we're friends as well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141010": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141011": "Is everyone in Astra as candid as you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141012": "I can't help but feel a bit embarrassed...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141013": "But this way, I can properly adjust to Astra's culture and customs.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60141014": "I look forward to learning much from you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142001": "Are you available, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142002": "Actually Dantang, I was about to come looking for you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142003": "You discovered the begonias in your room, I presume?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142004": "So you really were the one who sent these to me?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142005": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142006": "Over the last few days, I've come to realize that Astra is a land full of upright and outstanding people.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142007": "Despite my relatively short time here...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142008": "I've discovered that my powers have grown considerably.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142009": "Even the begonias at my side are blooming more beautifully.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142010": "So I thought I'd present you with some of them as a token of goodwill.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142011": "\"Knowledge from books and experience from the world.\" That's one of your favorite sayings, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142012": "If you've gotten more powerful, it's because of all of your hard work.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142013": "Thank you for your praise.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60142014": "I'll be sure to work even harder in order to live up to your expectations.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143001": "Did you know that my pipa is also capable of playing Caelestite-style music?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143002": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143003": "Many believe that Astra and Longzhou are incompatible in terms of music.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143004": "But I've never been one to believe such a notion.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143005": "I saw your recent performance on the Bridge. It was quite spectacular.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143006": "So I decided to use my spare time to practice my pipa techniques.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143007": "To my surprise, I discovered the secret to playing the music of the Caelestites.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143008": "Now I can play the signature melodies, while also adding a hint of Longzhou's musical style.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143009": "I believe you'll find it quite enjoyable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143010": "It sounds incredible!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143011": "Your pipa might even be able to activate a Colossus in Longzhou, Dantang!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143012": "The thought never crossed my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143013": "I'll have to hire some of the Ye Kingdom's finest craftsmen and have a Colossus constructed just for Longzhou.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143014": "I hope you'll be able to offer your guidance when the time comes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60143015": "I'd be honored to help!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144001": "Do you believe in destiny, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144002": "I do.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144003": "Every person has all kinds of predestined choices in front of them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144004": "But our hard work and ambition is what determines the course of our destiny.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144005": "I don't.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144006": "I don't think anyone has the power to decide the course of my life.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144007": "If destiny truly exists, it exists in the palms of our hands.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144008": "Your words fill me with profound admiration.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144009": "That is because I have always held the same views.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144010": "The fortune-teller who was present at my birth determined that my destiny would be an inauspicious one.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144011": "Yet I've survived unscathed to this very day, have I not?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144012": "In fact, I have even awakened newfound powers far outside of Longzhou's borders...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144013": "You awakened new powers, Dantang? Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60144014": "It's all thanks to you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60151001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60151002": "Good morning, Dantang!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60151003": "Did you sleep well last night?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60151004": "I thought I would have much more trouble sleeping in such an unfamiliar setting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60151005": "But I fell fast asleep not long after night descended.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60151006": "I had even prepared some calming teas, but it seems I won't be needing them now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60151007": "That's great to hear!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60151008": "If you know anyone who is having trouble sleeping aboard the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60151009": "Please tell them they're welcome to take some calming teas from me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60151010": "Sure thing!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152002": "Dantang? You're up early!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152003": "Can this hour really be considered early?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152004": "Could it be that you're still in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152005": "I'm up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152006": "Although I'm still a little sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152007": "I am...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152008": "But I'll get up right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152009": "If you still feel this tired in the morning, perhaps you're overexerting yourself every day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152010": "I'll have Jiu light some invigorating aromatic substances on the Colossus. Is that okay?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152011": "Stimulating aromatics? Sounds pretty expensive.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152012": "Not to worry, I brought them from my homeland.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152013": "I wouldn't ask you to pay for them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60152014": "Th-That's not what I meant...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153002": "I noticed that many people in Astra enjoy having a cup of coffee in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153003": "Is this one of your customs as well?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153004": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153005": "Sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153006": "What about you, Dantang?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153007": "To tell the truth, the first time I tried coffee...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153008": "I found its taste to be even more bitter than medicine.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153009": "I was baffled by everyone's insistence on consuming such a bitter drink.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153010": "But after a few more attempts, I suddenly began to appreciate the taste of coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153011": "Much like tea, drinking coffee also offers benefits for both the body and the mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153012": "As expected of a princess...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60153013": "You're able to comprehend so much from something as simple as drinking coffee!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154002": "I'm feeling somewhat ill today, so please don't come to find me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154003": "You're not feeling well? I'll send a doctor to take a look at you!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154004": "That won't be necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154005": "But I'm still worried... I'll just go check on you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154006": "Please refrain from doing so!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154007": "... What's the matter? You seem different from usual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154008": "I suppose it wouldn't hurt to tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154009": "Perhaps I'm still not acclimated to this new environment, and a blemish appeared on my forehead today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154010": "It's very unsightly, so I wish to avoid seeing anyone right now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154011": "A blemish? Oh, you mean a pimple? That's okay, no one here minds it at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154012": "Yes... But I mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60154013": "...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60161001": "Good day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60161002": "Thank you for preparing lunch, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60161003": "As expected, Astra's cuisine is far different than that of Longzhou.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60161004": "So you ate today's lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60161005": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60161006": "To gain experience from the world, I must experience everything that this land has to offer.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60161007": "How could I possibly further my ambitions if I can't even eat another land's food?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60161008": "But I messed up while making today's lunch. I couldn't even finish it...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60161009": "Is... Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60161010": "You mean that wasn't one of Astra's unique cooking methods?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60162001": "Good day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60162002": "Have you had lunch yet, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60162003": "I did! Those were all specialty dishes from Longzhou, weren't they?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60162004": "You're a seriously amazing cook, Dantang!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60162005": "Jiu was actually the one who prepared the food.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60162006": "Well, if your bodyguard can make such incredible food, that must mean you're even better!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60162007": "Er... Not necessarily.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60162008": "Whenever I try to cook, Jiu stops me at all costs...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60162009": "So I really don't know the full extent of my cooking skills.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60162010": "I-I see.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60163001": "Good day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60163002": "Do you mind if I play my pipa aboard your Colossus, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60163003": "Of course I don't mind.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60163004": "In fact, I've always been excited to hear you play!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60163005": "Once I've honed my skills a bit more...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60163006": "I would be honored to play for you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60163007": "Until then, please avoid listening to my practice.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60163008": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60164001": "Good day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60164002": "The day is halfway done. Please remember to rest.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60164003": "I'll take a break just as soon as I finish this task.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60164004": "PlayerName, do you often sacrifice diet and rest in order to complete your work?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60164005": "I should be ashamed of myself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60164006": "It seems I'll have to read through all the books on the Colossus one more time to prove my diligence.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60164007": "Huh? You read every single one of them already? But that's a lot of books!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60164008": "Even I haven't read some of them...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165001": "Good day.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165002": "I'm having one of the Fireflies bring you a cup of tea that I brewed just now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165003": "Thanks, Dantang!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165004": "I'm surprised you learned how to use the Fireflies so quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165005": "Your Fireflies are just very intelligent is all. They know exactly what I require with only the slightest bit of prompting.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165006": "I also feel very close to them when I see them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165007": "Back in my homeland, the Ye Kingdom, we have inventions known as clockwork birds. They're very similar to your Fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165008": "Should the opportunity present itself, you should see the Ye Kingdom for yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165009": "Sure, as long as you're there to show me around!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165010": "I...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60165011": "If I'm able to return at that time, I'd very much like to serve as your guide.",

  "str_quest_chat01_60181002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60181003": "You should eat something before it gets too late.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60181004": "I did.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60181005": "If you wish to eat something else before bed, it's best to do so as early as possible.",

  "str_quest_chat01_60181007": "You seem to know a lot about this, Dantang. Have you studied medicine before?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60181008": "These are just tips for nourishing the body. Everyone in Longzhou is quite familiar with these concepts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60181009": "All I've mentioned are some of the most basic ideas.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60181010": "Nourishing the body? Sounds pretty mysterious...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60182001": "Have you noticed the brightest star in the night sky?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60182002": "I have. It's pretty hard to ignore, since it's so bright.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60182003": "In Longzhou, we believe that someone resides on that star.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60182004": "What kind of person would live on a star?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60182005": "According to our legends, she ties her hair in a beautiful bun, and wears elegant, flowing robes...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60182006": "A beautiful woman with almond-shaped eyes and a face as smooth and flawless as a silver platter.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60182007": "She sounds a lot like you, Dantang.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60182008": "Surely you must be joking, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60182009": "But with your kind words, may we both dream of this beautiful star tonight.",

  "str_quest_chat01_60183005": "Have you heard this poem before?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60183006": "Nope. Was it written by someone in Longzhou too?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60183007": "Precisely. When I made the long and arduous journey across the sea...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60183008": "I never expected to find anyone carrying out the will of this poem here in Astra.",

  "str_quest_chat01_60185009": "I returned to the place where I was born and rebuilt my home.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60185010": "I see. Then I shouldn't give up so easily.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60185011": "Of course not! Besides, I'm sure you'll be able to return in victory someday!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60185012": "And if you run into any problems, we'll always be there to help!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60185013": "PlayerName... Thank you.",

  "str_quest_chat01_60201008": "The truth is, my father was the best when it came to making sugar figurines.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60201009": "With a blow here and a twist there, the most beautifully translucent sugar figurines would appear at his fingertips.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60201010": "Naturally, this technique takes years of practice despite the actual process lasting less than a minute.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60201011": "Aside from putting on a display of skill, creating the perfect syrup for sugar figurines is an art form in its own right.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60201012": "I didn't realize you were so serious about making sugar figurines.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60201013": "My father passed these skills on to me, so naturally I must continue his legacy.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60201014": "What's more, these skills are capable of putting a smile on your face.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202001": "Guess what? I was struck by inspiration just now, so I made a rough estimate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202002": "My friend, you must let me read your fortune right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202003": "Why? Did I upset you somehow?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202004": "What's that supposed to mean? I'm just a fortune-teller, it's never my intent to hurt others!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202005": "Really? Go for it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202006": "Let's not be too hasty, my friend. Allow me to prepare my fortune sticks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202007": "From what I can tell, your hexagram is quite odd: a confusing combination of both yin and yang.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202008": "This fortune is known as the \"cat.\"",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202009": "So what does it mean?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202010": "The true meaning of your fortune is tied to the will of the heavens. As such, it cannot be easily mentioned.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202011": "Nevertheless, I might have a way to resolve this dilemma.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202012": "Hmm? Oh, my.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202013": "The road ahead is fraught with danger and difficulties, but so long as you have a capable companion at your side, no obstacle will be too great to overcome.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202014": "Ideally, this companion should be someone with the gift of eloquence, a problem-solver who can navigate through any stressful situation with ease.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202015": "Why does it feel like... You're just complimenting yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202016": "Also, didn't you say that you can only read fortunes in person?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202017": "Come now, it's no fun if you take things too seriously! Besides, what harm could I possibly cause you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60202018": "But since you had pointed it out, just give it some thought, will you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203001": "PlayerName, are you good at finding things by any chance?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203002": "What happened this time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203003": "Jabber disappeared two days ago, and has been lost ever since.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203004": "Oh, you mean one of those two birds that are always following you around.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203005": "You're a fortune-teller, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203006": "Why don't you just use your skills to find Jabber?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203007": "Oh, don't bring that up.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203008": "My brand of fortune-telling concerns itself with determining the right place and time for certain opportunities.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203009": "I'm still very unfamiliar with Astra, meaning that my powers aren't entirely dependable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203010": "In crucial moments such as these, I have no choice but to rely on locals like yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203011": "Sure, but how am I supposed to help you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203012": "Well... It would take too long to fully explain, so why not come visit me instead?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203013": "It'd be a tremendous help!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203014": "Since you put it that way, I'll do my best to lend a hand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203015": "Thank you so much, my friend! Let's meet on the Bridge, agreed?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60203999": "Li Tianxian is waiting for you on the bridge. Go and find him.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60241001": "I, Tianxian, humbly thank you for allowing me into your home.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60241002": "I am but an honest man, and a penniless one at that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60241003": "But my mastery of fortune-telling is known both far and wide.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60241004": "Aside from this, I can make sugar figurines for your entertainment whenever and wherever you need.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60241005": "No need to be so polite. Just think of this place as your home away from home.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60241006": "I couldn't possibly do that! After all, when staying as a guest in another person's home, it's always best to demonstrate proper respect for the host and the rules of their house.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60241007": "You, on the other hand, may simply refer to me as Tianxian.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60241008": "Sure thing, Tianxian. Welcome aboard!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60241009": "The pleasure is all mine, my friend!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242001": "It seems my arms have gotten stronger recently.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242002": "Some days ago, Squawk and Jabber were up to their usual antics in a nearby tree.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242003": "I waved my banner at them to signal them to settle down.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242004": "Imagine my surprise when I accidentally split the tree in half!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242005": "If you didn't embellish your stories, I'd be really impressed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242006": "I'm not exaggerating at all!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242007": "The force was so great that it sent both birds and beasts running for the hills! Even the nearby Eclipsites began to howl in fear!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242008": "Not exaggerating, huh...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242009": "In any case!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242010": "I've learned so many interesting things by following you on your many adventures and have had fun doing so.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242011": "My powers have grown considerably as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242012": "If the right opportunity ever presents itself, I may even try to be a martial arts master.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242013": "Perhaps I should call myself the Tree-Splitting Master, what do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60242014": "I think you need to settle down too...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243001": "My senses have suddenly grown sharper lately. It's quite refreshing.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243002": "I feel as though I can see and hear things from thousands of miles away.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243003": "The swaying of tall grass in a distant land, the muddled sounds of people and the objects around them.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243004": "I can perceive them all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243005": "I believe I've transcended into an entirely new realm.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243006": "Congrats! Just remember not to use your abilities for any strange ideas.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243007": "I've never done anything of the sort! I am perfectly well-behaved, I'll have you know.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243008": "Tianxian, the honorable and world-famous fortune-teller, would never do anything to sully his good name!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243009": "But you're always disguising yourself as other people!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243010": "When walking along a river's edge, wet feet are an inevitability.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243011": "To keep one's feet warm and dry requires changing shoes and socks frequently!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243012": "A person must adapt quickly in order to live well. Surely you understand this?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243013": "Sure, whatever you say.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60243014": "Hold on, it doesn't sound right when you say it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244001": "I have something to discuss with you, regardless of whether or not you have the time to listen.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244002": "You remember my Scroll of Divine Ascension, yes?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244003": "I've never put much esteem in things like \"destiny,\" so naturally I haven't been very diligent about completing it.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244004": "But lately, I've been looking back at all of my experiences in my more than twenty years of living.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244005": "I must say, the things that happen in our lives are almost entirely out of our control.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244006": "But that's precisely the reason we need to dig in our heels and stand strong.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244007": "Only by doing so will we find the right path for ourselves.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244008": "Wow, Tianxian... I don't think I've ever heard you say anything this righteous before.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244009": "Really? What kind of man do you take me for, may I ask?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244010": "Ahem! Let's get back to the topic at hand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244011": "I'm not here to waste your time with grandiose notions.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244012": "I just wanted to share my feelings about our recent adventures together.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244013": "I noticed a certain quality in you a long time ago, and now I believe that quality is presenting itself in me as well.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244014": "Meeting you was a blessing for which I'll always be grateful.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244015": "You're being way too normal now. It's starting to scare me...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60244016": "Eh? I open up to you and that's how you respond?! Begone, you heartless oaf!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60251001": "Morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60251002": "Have you eaten yet, friend?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60251003": "Morning, Tianxian. I wanted to get a little more sleep, so I still haven't eaten.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60251004": "Oh my. A day's plan starts with the dawn, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60251005": "How can you still be asleep when the sun is shining so brightly?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60251006": "Delicious food waits for no one. If you don't get up soon, it'll all be gone!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60251007": "Especially these sweet, crispy pies! I think I'll have two more, if no one else will.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60251008": "Alright, already! I'm getting up!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60252001": "Tell me, do you know why birds insist on chattering like this every single day?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60252002": "Something the matter, Tianxian?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60252003": "I'm talking about these starlings of mine. What's the point of waking up so early if they're just going to fill the skies with their infernal squawking?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60252004": "Oh, you mean Squawk and Jabber. I thought it was a little noisier than usual today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60252005": "I'm terribly sorry if they interrupted your sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60252006": "My starlings are no different than petulant little children. I can't go a single day without scolding them, yet they never seem to learn.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60252007": "Don't worry about it. An early start means I can get more work done today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60252008": "Thank you for understanding.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60253001": "A fresh breeze heralds a comfortable day, and so I wish you a good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60253002": "Morning, Tianxian.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60253003": "You're right, the weather feels really nice today.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60253004": "Indeed. A perfect day for taking a walk or gathering one's thoughts.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60253005": "The weather doesn't seem that great today...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60253006": "Oh, don't mind me, I was just making idle conversation.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60253007": "You seem pretty idle most days, Tianxian.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60253008": "You say that as though we haven't known each other for a long time now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261001": "In any case, I was just passing by to say hello, as Miss Vice just ran me out of the dining hall.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261002": "Ran you out? What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261003": "As the primary caretaker of two starlings, I'm no different than their father.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261004": "Out of concern for them, I invited them on board.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261005": "Little did I know that those traitorous birds had no intention of behaving themselves.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261006": "As soon as they saw today's lunch, they descended on the table before I even had time to pick up my chopsticks.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261007": "In a flurry of food and feathers, the dining table was left in complete disarray.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261008": "That's terrible...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261009": "And it only got worse! When Miss Vice saw the mess, she was positively furious.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261010": "Did you forget to buy them food again?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261011": "It's not that I forgot.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261012": "Money has been scarce lately, so I've been relying on your hospitality a bit more than usual.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261013": "I see. Well, I guess life would be a lot more boring without them around, right?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60261014": "At times I can hardly tell if their presence is a blessing or a curse!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60262001": "Good afternoon. Haven't you taken your break yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60262002": "Good afternoon, Tianxian. I'm still pretty busy, so no.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60262003": "You really have no intention of resting this afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60262004": "After eating my fill and enjoying the sun's warmth, I'm feeling quite sleepy now.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60262005": "You'll miss out on a wonderful experience if you refuse to take a nap soon.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60262006": "I wish I had time for an afternoon nap like you...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60262007": "I'm doing no such thing, for your information! I happen to be searching for new insights and information aboard the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60262008": "You're just walking around with nothing to do, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60262009": "Too much honesty will leave you without friends before long!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60262010": "Oh? It appears two people have just started to argue somewhere nearby. Until next time!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263001": "What an unfortunate day indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263002": "Injustice abounds even in our bright and beautiful world.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263003": "What kind of trouble did you make for yourself this time?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263004": "I was just walking along, minding my own business, when some lunatic accosted me and called me a \"cow-faced cheat\"!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263005": "He claimed that I had deceived him, and that it was my fault that he ended up penniless and on the street.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263006": "Really? I know you don't come across as the most honest person sometimes, but I doubt you'd ever do something like that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263007": "Of course not! And after some digging around, I discovered that this man was well-known for harassing people.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263008": "A wicked person whose wild schemes left him in such a pitiful state. How unfortunate.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263009": "You didn't trick him under a fake identity, did you Tianxian?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263010": "I was just an innocent bystander in all of this! I could never do something like that!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60263011": "Let the matter pass from your mind. It was just an unfortunate encounter, nothing more.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281001": "Oh, the pain! Like a thousand knives in my heart, I can no longer sleep well at night!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281002": "I-Is there something wrong with your heart, Tianxian?! Do we need to call a doctor?!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281003": "Not my heart, but my tooth! It hurts more than the worst illness imaginable!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281004": "That's what happens when you eat too many sweets before bed.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281005": "You wouldn't understand.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281006": "Sweets may rot my teeth, but they also soothe my soul.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281007": "Anger and frustration can hurt even more than the gravest of flesh wounds.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281008": "Can't hurt too much if you're still talking.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281009": "P-P-Please take pity on this poor fortune-teller!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281010": "Even when seriously ill, I still abide by the strictest code of etiquette.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281011": "Especially when I'm in such desperate need, just like right now!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281012": "Fine, I get it. You want me to go buy you some medicine, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281013": "Not at all, my compassionate friend! All I need are a few more pieces of candy to get me through the night, as I've completely run out.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60281014": "... Good night!!!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282001": "Good evening. Have you gone to bed yet?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282002": "Not yet. I'm still not tired enough to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282003": "Then it's the perfect time for a story about discovering great wealth!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282004": "There once was a strange man in the Zhao Empire. His hands and feet were abnormally slender, and he had rat-like eyes beneath a pair of wicked-looking eyebrows.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282005": "Despite his evil and crafty appearance, the man possessed a great fortune and spent his money wantonly.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282006": "He'd spend his days perusing and purchasing expensive pieces of porcelain and other leisurely trinkets.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282007": "Sounds like a Fiendling with a ton of money to me.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282008": "Yes, but that's not important.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282009": "What's important is that the money didn't truly belong to him.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282010": "After inquiring for some time, a kind-hearted traveler discovered that he was misusing the funds given to him by his clients.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282011": "For his skills, he was often hired by officials and wealthy clients alike to sniff out and procure treasures found in the markets.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282012": "But one day, he disappeared like a wisp of smoke in the breeze.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282013": "It was then that his rich patrons discovered that the so-called \"treasures\" he bought for them were nothing more than broken or useless trash.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282014": "And so a scoundrel became a savior, and a rich one at that.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282015": "In other words, he funneled rich people's wealth back into the hands of the poor... Even though his methods weren't exactly the most honorable.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282016": "So this was a folk hero story all along, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282017": "The story isn't over just yet! There's still the best part!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282018": "Not long after this man vanished, a porcelain merchant known as The Third Richest Man suddenly appeared.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282019": "Somehow I feel like it was you again, Tianxian...",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282020": "Are you perhaps implying that I look like a rat?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282021": "N... Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60282022": "And with that, the story is now over.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283001": "Windy, moonless nights such as this are perfect for seeking amusement.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283002": "Tell me, have you been doing anything interesting lately?",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283003": "Careful, Tianxian. There are plenty of people on the Colossus who are tired of your shenanigans.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283004": "If you keep this up, someone's really going to get mad at you.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283005": "Oh, I'd never do anything of the sort.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283006": "I can't afford to be discovered, even if I'm doing nothing wrong in the first place.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283007": "I'm not foolish enough to do anything unsightly in broad daylight.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283008": "And if people claim to know my secrets, I'll have to start charging them for that kind of information.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283009": "No one will want to join in my fun if they have to pay for it!",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283010": "Alright, alright... Forget I said anything.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283011": "It's getting late, so we should save this conversation for later.",
  "str_quest_chat01_60283012": "I'll be sure to come back and pester you if I discover anything interesting tomorrow!"
