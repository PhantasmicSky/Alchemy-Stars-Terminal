  "str_voice_1200501_2": "The violence in Umbraton follows its own rules, which is different from the \"fair games\" the people above play. Shadow Wolf also said that before. Well, whatever.",

  "str_voice_1200501_21": "The only rule of Umbraton is that there are no rules. They're really a violent bunch...",
  "str_voice_1200501_22": "Rebuild Sharkfang Island!",

  "str_voice_1201631_2": "Such a huge flying ship! It should be called an Airship. \"Colossus\" just doesn't sound right...",
  "str_voice_1201631_20": "Hmmm, Umbraton... many of the people here do have a good taste for art, but most are just pompous.",
  "str_voice_1201631_21": "Those old fellows in Lumopolis are rigid, but they do have an eye for beauty. Anyway, I think making money is more important.",

  "str_voice_1201631_25": "Hachi and Gin? They're just black-hearted conmen who happen to sell paintings. They do come across some good ones though...",
  "str_voice_1201631_26": "There's a painter here? Quick, introduce me...",
  "str_voice_1201631_27": "I really hate people who don't take the creative process seriously.",
  "str_voice_1201631_28": "Whoa, this place is filled with equipment. Perhaps, we can use it for Al***my St**s...",
  "str_voice_1201631_29": "Can you paint? Or do you know someone who can? I'm Tourdog, and I'm looking for someone to join my project, Al***my St**s...",
  "str_voice_1201631_3": "I don't mind reflecting reality in my works, but there has to be an element of dreams as well. A dreamless work is doomed to mediocrity...",
  "str_voice_1201631_30": "I can feel it!",
  "str_voice_1201631_31": "I can satisfy any request.",
  "str_voice_1201631_32": "I only need 3 seconds.",
  "str_voice_1201631_33": "Ha! Now that's real progress!",
  "str_voice_1201631_34": "Time to work...",
  "str_voice_1201631_35": "I have all the materials I need.",

  "str_voice_1201631_39": "Whoa! So cute!",
  "str_voice_1201631_4": "Redo the work? No way... Okay fine, but do I get paid more?",
  "str_voice_1201631_40": "Good luck!",
  "str_voice_1201631_41": "I can do this your way!",
  "str_voice_1201631_42": "One step closer to my goal!",
  "str_voice_1201631_43": "Eh... You can take care of the comforting...",
  "str_voice_1201631_44": "Let's play Al***my St**s!",
  "str_voice_1201631_45": "It'd be great if it were an awesome painting...",
  "str_voice_1201631_46": "I'll use it in Al***my St**s.",
  "str_voice_1201631_47": "I'll get you the Al***my St**s beta test account right away!",
  "str_voice_1201631_48": "Whoa! I feel inspired!",
  "str_voice_1201631_49": "I came across that piece of equipment by chance when I was exploring the ruins earlier. I need to get started on Al***my St**s.",

  "str_voice_1201631_50": "The first few years of making the game were incredibly challenging, and I couldn't do it on my own... Fortunately, I managed to get help from new friends, even investors.",
  "str_voice_1201631_51": "I was inspired by the Aurora, because I was born in Northland. But it was the game manual that guided me to Umbraton.",

  "str_voice_1201631_8": "Listen to this. Thanks to my patrons, I can focus on making games and reading pitches. I guess the Lumopolis... I mean Umbraton people, are not entirely blind.",
  "str_voice_1201631_9": "It's very cold in Northland but the Aurora is absolutely gorgeous... And it was under that peculiar light that my dream of Al***my St**s was born.",

  "str_voice_1300491_48": "This is exactly my taste! I'm too embarrassed to thank you!",
  "str_voice_1300491_49": "The leopard head is my helmet! I put it on by chance and couldn't take it off. Boss recommended using it as a personal style thing. Why not? I look cool with it.",
  "str_voice_1300491_5": "People often tend to over-think everything. The only truth in this world is whether I beat you or you beat me.",
  "str_voice_1300491_50": "Honestly, even if I could take the helmet off, I wouldn't. My face is much scarier—courtesy of the Eclipsites.",

  "str_voice_1300491_57": "Happy New Year! Have a drink!",
  "str_voice_1300491_7": "Don't mind my two great swords or the leopard-head helmet. I can eat normally and it doesn't obscure my vision at all. Now, stop asking irritating questions!",
  "str_voice_1300491_8": "These two swords aren't bad, but a little lightweight for me. When do I get a better, sharper, more powerful weapon, boss?",
  "str_voice_1300491_9": "How do you like my leopard-head helmet? It's not the original but a mod. Whoa, don't touch it! And don't rub it, either!",
  "str_voice_1300511_1": "- Me, fierce? Um, I'm farsighted, but it might just be me wanting to eat you.\n- Chirp chirp chirp!",

  "str_voice_1300511_16": "A new quest?",

  "str_voice_1300511_21": "As for grenades, the ones from Illumina are the best. They're light and make quite a bang.",

  "str_voice_1300591_49": "What did you say? Whoa! You wrote a profile for everyone? That sounded like work, like totally... Erm, don't get mad, but what's with the \"Objects Broken\" entry?",
  "str_voice_1300591_5": "So, how are we supposed to get a Speaker? Totally can't get promoted in the Courier Union without a Speaker. Isn't there any training for that? Catch one myself? No way...",
  "str_voice_1300591_50": "Somebody gave me the scarf. How else could an ordinary sparrow get a powerful artifact like that... Emphasis on powerful!",

  "str_voice_1300941_16": "Just getting ready to go on patrol. I wasn't dozing off or anything...",
  "str_voice_1300941_17": "I get up early every day because I need to go on patrol. But you get up early, too...",
  "str_voice_1300941_18": "It's almost break time, isn't it?",
  "str_voice_1300941_19": "I'm used to living like this, but you should rest...",
  "str_voice_1300941_2": "Why do I have short hair? There's nothing special behind it. I just find it easier to manage...",
  "str_voice_1300941_20": "With vast patches of snow and warm sunlight, it's such a reassuring place...",
  "str_voice_1300941_21": "There should be spring up in that big, white city, right?",

  "str_voice_1300941_27": "If you must know, it's noisy places... They make me nervous.",

  "str_voice_1300941_44": "It... It's a little noisy over there... I'm not used to it...",
  "str_voice_1300941_45": "It's a gift for me... Um, thanks.",
  "str_voice_1300941_46": "I'm a little surprised...",

  "str_voice_1300941_49": "I took the Staff of Spring that Her Majesty offered me, and continued the work left by my parents... It's not about destiny, it's... It's just something I have to do.",

  "str_voice_1300941_50": "The frozen kingdom of Northland... The crisp air, the gentle sunshine, and the vast fields of snow where I would lose myself in thought... That's my favorite place in the world.",
  "str_voice_1300941_51": "I'm used to patrolling alone in the snow. Sometimes, I listen to passing travelers talk about the things they've seen and heard, as well as how spring is like... How I wish to see it myself...",

  "str_voice_1400071_17": "Ah... How soothing this wind is...",
  "str_voice_1400071_18": "The wind has brought you home.",
  "str_voice_1400071_19": "Nice view here, especially at night...",

  "str_voice_1400071_20": "Sure, everyone's noisy here, but I'm okay with it really, because they're all good people.",
  "str_voice_1400071_21": "In Umbraton, the poor aren't the worst off, the impoverished orphans are.",
  "str_voice_1400071_22": "Free and unconstrained.",
  "str_voice_1400071_23": "It's the Eclipsites' nature to attack. They're actually simple creatures when compared to the soul of evil beings...",
  "str_voice_1400071_24": "Erm, have you seen the rabbit that drank diesel? No? I wanted to ask if he'd like to catch some fresh air with me.",
  "str_voice_1400071_25": "Sinsa is the glue that holds the Rediesel Wrench together.",
  "str_voice_1400071_26": "If you see a rabbit, please leave it alone.",
  "str_voice_1400071_27": "I think the Livia now is more than enough to hold her own against that guy without anyone's help.",
  "str_voice_1400071_28": "Such a big place, and habitable too. Plus, it flies in the sky, so it's quite reassuring...",
  "str_voice_1400071_29": "Leaves and petals can be lethal weapons, but the human heart cuts the deepest...",
  "str_voice_1400071_3": "Oh, what do I have to do to lead a peaceful life... Perhaps I am now...?",

  "str_voice_1400071_37": "Shred the target!",
  "str_voice_1400071_38": "Blades! Scatter!",

  "str_voice_1400071_43": "Withdrawing for now. Take care of yourself!",
  "str_voice_1400071_44": "Here puts even my mind at peace...",
  "str_voice_1400071_45": "Thanks for the gift.",
  "str_voice_1400071_46": "How precious! Can I keep it?",
  "str_voice_1400071_47": "Thank you. You sure are trying hard.",
  "str_voice_1400071_48": "This is what I've always wanted! So... can I really?",
  "str_voice_1400071_49": "Never hold an orphan hostage in the name of love. It could turn what's supposed to be a loving heart into an icy prison... Fortunately, everything has a turning point.",
  "str_voice_1400071_5": "Nothing is more important than freedom... That's right, nothing...",
  "str_voice_1400071_50": "There are many orphans like me. Luckily, I met my master, who seems to come from the far east...",
  "str_voice_1400071_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1400071_53": "Hey...",
  "str_voice_1400071_54": "Good morning.",
  "str_voice_1400071_55": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_voice_1400071_56": "Good night.",
  "str_voice_1400071_57": "Ha-Happy New Year.",
  "str_voice_1400071_7": "I'm still not used to your gentle kindness, but, thank you...",
  "str_voice_1400071_8": "This kindness reminds me of something from long ago... Never mind, it's just some boring old tale...",
  "str_voice_1400071_9": "Fancy seeing you again. How about some fresh air? The afternoon breeze is... Oh, sorry, forgot you're not one into tossing in the wind.",
  "str_voice_1400081_1": "How are you feeling today? Do you need some hammering? Hey, I'm just kidding.",
  "str_voice_1400081_10": "I have to replace the bearings of the key parts... and recalculate the speed... Hey, when did you get here?",
  "str_voice_1400081_11": "I'm better at behind-the-scenes work... Forget it, since you insist...",
  "str_voice_1400081_12": "Hey! Don't step on my tools! Yeah, I'm talking about your right foot!",
  "str_voice_1400081_13": "Hey, are you free? Can you help me braid my hair...? My hair is too puffy today for me to do it myself.",
  "str_voice_1400081_14": "This scarf is my most important treasure, so it has to be washed with care... Hey, I didn't ask you to wash it!",
  "str_voice_1400081_15": "Are you expecting me to sing you a birthday song?... I should just get you a music box.",
  "str_voice_1400081_16": "Yo, you're here. I thought you wouldn't be returning.",
  "str_voice_1400081_17": "I was going to install some artificial lighting for you, but I can see it's no longer necessary.",
  "str_voice_1400081_18": "Would you like to occasionally try... Forget it, it's tough being tech personnel, too.",
  "str_voice_1400081_19": "Sometimes the bright light is more terrible than the dark night. You... It's fine.",
  "str_voice_1400081_2": "When I was on standby, I performed some daily maintenance on your ship! Like Honcho Sinsa says, those who don't work shall not eat!",
  "str_voice_1400081_20": "Shouldn't they be pickier with their loot? Why do those guys always bring back garbage...",
  "str_voice_1400081_21": "I heard that Illumina values scientific technology... Don't misunderstand me! I'm very important in Rediesel Wrench, too!",
  "str_voice_1400081_22": "Take a break from shouting.",
  "str_voice_1400081_23": "I guess I understand why the Eclipsites fear bright lights.",
  "str_voice_1400081_24": "Take one look at Odi and you'll know how tough it is to be tech personnel. He's always so angry that he can never think straight.",
  "str_voice_1400081_25": "I didn't ask him to save me; he himself couldn't help saving me... but I am quite grateful to him.",
  "str_voice_1400081_26": "Handmade is studying technology and assembling with various parts!",
  "str_voice_1400081_27": "I dislike incompetent guys and hate those incompetents who are all talks and no action! That includes my own self.",
  "str_voice_1400081_28": "Are you really not going to cooperate with us? If you don't want your Colossus, I'll drag it back with us! I'm serious!",
  "str_voice_1400081_29": "Don't get me wrong, I came to test your mettle behind Honcho Sinsa's back!",
  "str_voice_1400081_3": "I wonder how Honcho Sinsa is doing? He always does stupid things that make others worry about him. If I'm not watching over him...",
  "str_voice_1400081_30": "Power increased!",
  "str_voice_1400081_31": "Isn't this level of privilege a matter of fact?",
  "str_voice_1400081_32": "I will become a bright light that illuminates the night!",
  "str_voice_1400081_34": "You should have chosen me sooner!",
  "str_voice_1400081_35": "Spotlights ready!",
  "str_voice_1400081_36": "Ta-da!",
  "str_voice_1400081_37": "Have a glimpse of my bright light!",
  "str_voice_1400081_38": "Eliminate your fear with light!",
  "str_voice_1400081_39": "Is it bright enough?",
  "str_voice_1400081_4": "This is an amazing engineering miracle... When I see this powerful Colossus following your orders, I... Um, nothing! You're amazing!",
  "str_voice_1400081_40": "My light will blind you.",
  "str_voice_1400081_41": "Uh-huh! Follow my command!",
  "str_voice_1400081_42": "Tee-hee! I'm here after all!",
  "str_voice_1400081_43": "Don't just stand there, you idiot. Run!",
  "str_voice_1400081_44": "Don't worry about my height! Worry about your Colossus instead! Humph!",
  "str_voice_1400081_45": "... What's this?",
  "str_voice_1400081_46": "Wooow! This is amazing!",
  "str_voice_1400081_47": "...It better be something useful.",
  "str_voice_1400081_48": "What a great gift! You know me well!",
  "str_voice_1400081_49": "Don't just judge based on my appearance. I grew up in a garbage dump and can assemble any equipment... Oh, that place is called the Loot Depot...",
  "str_voice_1400081_5": "I'm no longer a falling pebble. In that deep night, someone illuminated a path for me even when I was trying to escape... Now it's my turn to help.",
  "str_voice_1400081_50": "Humph! If you're not more serious, maybe Rediesel Wrench will take over this ship one day! Hey, why are you patting me on my head! I'm being serious here!",
  "str_voice_1400081_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1400081_53": "Can you hear me...",
  "str_voice_1400081_54": "Are you awake yet?",
  "str_voice_1400081_55": "Can you come over for a bit?",
  "str_voice_1400081_56": "If you're still awake...",
  "str_voice_1400081_57": "Go somewhere else if you want someone to wish you a 'Happy New Year'.",
  "str_voice_1400081_7": "You're so... How did you manage to survive for so long in these times?",
  "str_voice_1400081_8": "Although you're not one of Rediesel Wrench, you're actually quite different from those cowards. I guess you can barely qualify as the leader, though Honcho Sinsa is just a tiny bit better than you.",
  "str_voice_1400081_9": "If it was you who saved me that day instead of Honcho Sinsa... Maybe... Mfff! Nothing!",
  "str_voice_1400161_1": "The whole world is my enemy when I wake up, don't talk to me for a little while.",
  "str_voice_1400161_10": "I'm gonna take a nap. You! Take those animals away. Don't disturb me.",
  "str_voice_1400161_11": "You want me to do the stakeout? Fine. I'm always up all night anyway.",
  "str_voice_1400161_12": "You're tired? But you can't rest now. I stay up late all the time.",
  "str_voice_1400161_13": "This annoying little thing's rubbing against me again! Kafka, you have to stop being such a softie...",
  "str_voice_1400161_14": "Gotta take a break every once in a while. Where's Franz? Franz! Didn't I tell you to always stay close to me!?",
  "str_voice_1400161_15": "It's your birthday? Want my best wishes?",
  "str_voice_1400161_16": "Now is when those fluffy fellas are most active. Watch them! Don't let them wander off!",
  "str_voice_1400161_17": "How dare you disturb my rest! Oh... it's morning. Looks like I pulled an all-nighter again.",
  "str_voice_1400161_18": "No one's coming for the next shift? What a bunch of slackers! Someday, I'm gonna shoot them in the middle of the night...",
  "str_voice_1400161_19": "I'm exhausted. That's it. I'm done with this shift. Gonna get some sleep!",
  "str_voice_1400161_2": "Keep those fluffy things away from me if possible.",
  "str_voice_1400161_20": "Yes, they're all nice folks, but they all have a few loose screws! I'm the only one doing the stakeout. You see these dark circles?",
  "str_voice_1400161_21": "The Illumina guys have been trying hard to get my gun and study it. Like I'm gonna let that happen! What a bunch of crazy geeks!",
  "str_voice_1400161_22": "Let's give those bullies a taste of what it's like to be rubbed against the ground.",
  "str_voice_1400161_23": "As long as I have my gun, I'll kill all the Eclipsites that come my way and send them home for good.",
  "str_voice_1400161_24": "That giant lizard! I hate to say it, but it's sort of cute... Huh? What? Did I say anything?",
  "str_voice_1400161_25": "I haven't seen that bear-and-penguin pair for a long time. Are they still looking for air conditioners? I'll give them some parts if the chance comes.",
  "str_voice_1400161_26": "Control yourself, Kafka... I'll get back to petting the fluffy fellas later on...",
  "str_voice_1400161_27": "The noise! The noise! How come there's not even a single quiet bed to sleep in the great, big Rediesel desert?",
  "str_voice_1400161_28": "How gigantic this fella is! They say it has its own consciousness. Just get it to do the stakeout then if so.",
  "str_voice_1400161_29": "The name's Kafka. I have three requests: Don't get me to do the stakeout, get me a soundproof studio apartment for singles, and drive these animals away from me!",
  "str_voice_1400161_3": "Don't know where that Franz is again. That's for the best, I guess.",
  "str_voice_1400161_30": "Faster and more precise.",
  "str_voice_1400161_31": "Franz! Go!",
  "str_voice_1400161_32": "Let's use more powerful bullets!",
  "str_voice_1400161_33": "Shoot! Shoot like crazy!",
  "str_voice_1400161_34": "Spare no foes!",
  "str_voice_1400161_35": "Searching for enemies...",
  "str_voice_1400161_36": "Gauss rifle! Aim!",
  "str_voice_1400161_37": "Fire!",
  "str_voice_1400161_38": "Nowhere to hide!",
  "str_voice_1400161_39": "Super electric field! Scatter shot!",
  "str_voice_1400161_4": "Someone's bullying a puppy? Take me there. I'm gonna have that fellow live a life without hands...",
  "str_voice_1400161_40": "Close-range shot!",
  "str_voice_1400161_41": "I'll watch them like a hawk.",
  "str_voice_1400161_42": "A piece of cake.",
  "str_voice_1400161_43": "That was too stressful. I was off my game...",
  "str_voice_1400161_44": "No animals here? Great! Ah, but it's kinda boring...",
  "str_voice_1400161_45": "A gift for me? Fine, I'll take it.",
  "str_voice_1400161_46": "This gift looks pretty nice...",
  "str_voice_1400161_47": "Looks like it's worth a fortune. Thanks!",
  "str_voice_1400161_48": "This? Wow! Thanks so much!",
  "str_voice_1400161_49": "Rediesel Wrench? I didn't want to join them initially, but that giant lizard just made it too hard to refuse.",
  "str_voice_1400161_5": "We must check the bullets thoroughly. They tend to get stuck when we blast those who attack small animals...",
  "str_voice_1400161_50": "Wanna know how I managed to get this rifle? That's an interesting story, but before that, please drive these clingy little fellas away first.",
  "str_voice_1400161_51": "My home used to be a little castle, not this giant lizard. If it wasn't for the Eclipsites... Hmm... Don't feel like talking about it anymore. I'm gonna sleep.",
  "str_voice_1400161_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1400161_53": "You there?",
  "str_voice_1400161_54": "I know it's early.",
  "str_voice_1400161_55": "But do you have a second?",
  "str_voice_1400161_56": "Are you on duty?",
  "str_voice_1400161_57": "Like I'm gonna say it... Ahem. Happy New Year.",
  "str_voice_1400161_6": "I've got a better gun now. I'm gonna aim for those despicable beings—the Eclipsites, the noisemakers, and the torturers of small animals.",
  "str_voice_1400161_7": "Fluffy or not, whoever disturbs me will get shot and that includes you.",
  "str_voice_1400161_8": "These fellows always make me do the stakeout alone. You there! Take my place.",
  "str_voice_1400161_9": "Whoever disturbs my sleep will receive the Eclipsites treatment, including you.",
  "str_voice_1400171_1": "Where's the next fight? I'll make a getaway plan first, in case we can't handle the heat!",
  "str_voice_1400171_10": "Okay, we'll go with that for Plan E. Now for Plan F...",
  "str_voice_1400171_11": "Alright! I'll go confirm the nearest emergency exits!",
  "str_voice_1400171_12": "Wh-what is that sound? Oh! It's just you. Thank goodness. I almost jumped out the window.",
  "str_voice_1400171_13": "When is the equipment that I ordered going to be delivered? I guess I'll just have to wait...for 5 more minutes!",
  "str_voice_1400171_14": "I feel safe whenever I'm with you. Oh, but I do have our escape route planned!",
  "str_voice_1400171_15": "Happy birthday! I got a lot of celebrations in store for you, so which one would you like from A to J?",
  "str_voice_1400171_16": "You're back! I've come up with our escape route... Huh? We're not escaping?",
  "str_voice_1400171_17": "Good morning! Let's discuss a new plan, something that ends with \"route\"!",
  "str_voice_1400171_18": "Whoa! Welcome back! I'm not doing anything suspicious. Not at all!",
  "str_voice_1400171_19": "Not resting yet? Can't sleep? Feeling insecure? I can dig a hole for you!",
  "str_voice_1400171_2": "Hm? Something feels off! Hide! Or else...",
  "str_voice_1400171_20": "Even though nobody likes to live underground, being able to run around often is still great!",

  "str_voice_1400541_25": "The Lord handles government affairs very meticulously. I will do my best so that he can get some rest occasionally.",
  "str_voice_1400541_26": "I like people who are serious, especially those who work hard, fully focused!",

  "str_voice_1400541_50": "A knight should be tight-lipped. Be it good news or negative information, it must always be kept close to heart and never casually shared.",

  "str_voice_1400541_6": "When I can't go on anymore, I regain confidence by looking at this lamp. It isn't strange at all. Come closer, look through the light and you'll understand.",
  "str_voice_1400541_7": "Seriousness is a kind of chivalry. Keep practicing it and you'll receive honor. It's a shame that those nobles in Lumopolis don't understand this.",
  "str_voice_1400541_8": "Some people say I am way too serious, just like this arc ruler in my hand, which is rigid and inflexible. What do you think? Oh? Is that really the case?",

  "str_voice_1400571_1": "Ugh... Why does my hair look messy? Because it's too much work grooming it. It's very nice to touch though. Do you wanna touch it?",

  "str_voice_1400571_16": "Afternoons are simply wonderful! How nice it'd be if I could just take a short nap, meow! Eh? I'm not thinking about slacking, meow!",
  "str_voice_1400571_17": "What? Have you never witnessed morning crankiness, meow? That Vivian! I can't believe she set 10 alarms for me. Damn her, meow!",

  "str_voice_1400571_19": "So sleepy... I'm losing it, meow... Nom, nom, so many fish, so many, meow...",
  "str_voice_1400571_2": "The work of the intelligence department is so tedious and meticulous that it can be tricky at times, but there are perks as well. Like... Well, I'll tell you Vice's secret in exchange for dried fish.",

  "str_voice_1400571_25": "Officer Sharona's tail... It's not a toy, but I just can't help it, meow!",
  "str_voice_1400571_26": "I'm just gonna let you sneak a peek, meow! The legendary golden dried fish, my precious treasure, meow!",
  "str_voice_1400571_27": "M-meowhat? I have to run 800 meters? I definitely can't manage that. I can hardly run 100 meters, meow.",
  "str_voice_1400571_28": "It's so spacious! Can you arrange for me a room as well, meow? I want the floor to be covered with soft blankets, meow.",
  "str_voice_1400571_29": "Huh? Introduce myself? Can we skip that, meow? It's too troublesome. I just wanna catch some Zs, meow. I worked late into the night yesterday and am just... too... tired... to...",
  "str_voice_1400571_3": "No! I won't do it if I'm being forced to do it, because I don't like to do what everyone else does. Aren't all cats the same in this regard?",
  "str_voice_1400571_30": "Meowuwu... I have become stronger again!",
  "str_voice_1400571_31": "Are there any other ways to slack off, meow?",

  "str_voice_1400571_36": "Ugh, my eyelids are getting heavy...",
  "str_voice_1400571_37": "Meow! Stop! Don't move. Let me take a break, meow.",
  "str_voice_1400571_38": "Meow! You're all so stupid, meow.",
  "str_voice_1400571_39": "I'll take a break when I'm done.",
  "str_voice_1400571_4": "Oh no, what do I do? I seem to have become a little more powerful again.",
  "str_voice_1400571_40": "This is over now, meow!",
  "str_voice_1400571_41": "Okay, okay. I got it, I got it.",
  "str_voice_1400571_42": "Huh? They're defeated.",
  "str_voice_1400571_43": "Oops! We failed.",
  "str_voice_1400571_44": "Oh, wouldn't it be nice if I could just take a short nap?",
  "str_voice_1400571_45": "Mm, ah, let Philyshy sleep for a bit, meow.",
  "str_voice_1400571_46": "Meow? You got a gift for Yumi too? That's brilliant!",

  "str_voice_1400571_48": "Meow! We've wanted this for a long time! It's meowvellous!",
  "str_voice_1400571_49": "So what if I pray and work hard with all my might? What can that accomplish? I think I might as well sleep, meow.",
  "str_voice_1400571_5": "I'm very puny, but Yumi is the exact opposite. I know that Yumi has been protecting me... even though we can't meet.",
  "str_voice_1400571_50": "I actually have a teeny wish, meow... There was once a cat that kept me company, and my only hope is that it would come back to me, meow.",
  "str_voice_1400571_51": "As long as Philyshy wants, I'll always be me, Yumi, keeping her away from sufferings and fulfilling her wishes... I can do anything for her, except for meeting her in person.",

  "str_voice_1400571_57": "Whoa! Is it a New Year already, meow?",
  "str_voice_1400571_6": "Go to bed, Philyshy. When you're awake, you'll see lots and lots of dried fish piled up in the room, meow. There will be no Eclipsites, meow. Nor Eclipses, meow.",
  "str_voice_1400571_7": "Eh? Written in my psychology report are stuffs about Yumi and the fact that I love sleeping. Hey... I'm well aware of that okay? I'm a cat after all.",
  "str_voice_1400571_8": "You think you can bribe me with this cheap canned fish? And such cheap caviar? You have got to be kidding me!",
  "str_voice_1400571_9": "Did Yumi come out just now? She's a lonely child. If you happen to run into her, please treat her nicely. Me? You can treat me however.",

  "str_voice_1400611_2": "You want to learn how to master your emotions? No need! You've got me!",
  "str_voice_1400611_20": "Life at Illumina's Undercity may seem stressful to others, but it's actually tidy and orderly!",
  "str_voice_1400611_21": "Lumopolis is said to have a unique way of resolving emotional issues. I wonder if that's just a rumor.",
  "str_voice_1400611_22": "Splendor Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1400611_23": "Eclipsites are scumbags! They're filled with nothing but spite!",
  "str_voice_1400611_24": "Director Gronru really knows a lot, even dabbling in psychology.",
  "str_voice_1400611_25": "White Dwarf is so adorable! He may be older than me, but he is really a child at heart!",
  "str_voice_1400611_26": "I like to listen, especially when others confide in me",
  "str_voice_1400611_27": "Negative emotions are unhealthy, so you must find an outlet for them!",

  "str_voice_1400611_49": "Even if we have a dark and murky past, we can't always take such a negative perspective on life, can we?",
  "str_voice_1400611_5": "These elves can be used not only in battles but also in helping us to heal from emotional trauma...",
  "str_voice_1400611_50": "Ms. Gronru really takes care of me, and if it weren't for her support, my research wouldn't have been conducted so smoothly. I've been blessed with the most wonderful comrades.",
  "str_voice_1400611_51": "Now, everyone in Illumina is my family, that includes you, Navigator! I hope that together, I can create even moreeee wondrous emotions!",

  "str_voice_1400611_7": "Hey! Anything new you'd like to share with me today? I'm always here.",
  "str_voice_1400611_8": "Just say what's on your mind. I can always make time for you since it's part of my job.",
  "str_voice_1400611_9": "Come over here. I can sense your slightly troubled emotions. Need a pat on the head?",
  "str_voice_1400621_1": "Every time I look out from the Colossus, I marvel at the vastness of the world, and it's all thanks to Leah.",
  "str_voice_1400621_10": "Your eyelids are like flowers at dusk, they look like they're about to close. Go get some sleep.",
  "str_voice_1400621_11": "I'll do all I can.",
  "str_voice_1400621_12": "This sword? It may be made of wood, but it's as sharp as iron.",
  "str_voice_1400621_13": "Please stay away from me when I'm wielding my sword, in case you get entangled by the vines.",
  "str_voice_1400621_14": "This kind of room's... a little difficult to adapt to in a short time. I'm sorry. This is a nice room. There's just no aura of nature here.",
  "str_voice_1400621_15": "Happy birthday. I hope you like your present.",
  "str_voice_1400621_16": "It's the most important time of the day. Exercise regularly and don't slack off.",
  "str_voice_1400621_17": "Good morning. You look... kinda tired.",
  "str_voice_1400621_18": "Good evening. The forest can be very dangerous at night. You'd better stay away from it.",
  "str_voice_1400621_19": "I understand how you must be feeling, since there's never enough time to do everything. Still, it's important to get proper rest.",
  "str_voice_1400621_2": "I heard that this world is dozens of times bigger than the continents we can see. Is that true? What I wouldn't give to see what the rest of the world looks like.",
  "str_voice_1400621_20": "Northland... It is a place that doesn't get involved in the matters of the world, and the price paid is isolation.",
  "str_voice_1400621_21": "I've heard about how free-spirited people of the Rediesel Wrench are.",
  "str_voice_1400621_22": "For the North!",
  "str_voice_1400621_23": "A bunch of pathetic and abhorrent creatures. They shouldn't even exist.",

  "str_voice_1400621_25": "Leah... She's a very important friend to me in many ways.",
  "str_voice_1400621_26": "To me, a friend who can be frank and honest with me is the best.",
  "str_voice_1400621_27": "I wouldn't want to spend time with fakers and hypocrites.",
  "str_voice_1400621_28": "The Colossus is indeed interesting. I totally want one, too... It's normal for me to feel this way, isn't it?",
  "str_voice_1400621_29": "I am Sylva, the forest keeper of the Windward Forest. Nice to meet you.",
  "str_voice_1400621_3": "Can I make changes to my room? I'm used to being surrounded by greenery.",
  "str_voice_1400621_30": "The power is emerging.",
  "str_voice_1400621_31": "This is the fruit of my training.",

  "str_voice_1400621_33": "I'll protect everyone.",
  "str_voice_1400621_34": "Leave it to me.",
  "str_voice_1400621_35": "I'm doing this!",
  "str_voice_1400621_36": "What?",
  "str_voice_1400621_37": "Forest, summon the wind.",
  "str_voice_1400621_38": "Wind, pierce my enemies.",

  "str_voice_1400621_41": "I'll do my part.",
  "str_voice_1400621_42": "A precious victory.",
  "str_voice_1400621_43": "I'm too inexperienced...",
  "str_voice_1400621_44": "I don't know what I can do for you... How about if I give you some vines?",
  "str_voice_1400621_45": "This... Can I keep it?",
  "str_voice_1400621_46": "This stuff is interesting.",
  "str_voice_1400621_47": "Thank you... Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1400621_48": "Ahem, it's so nice to have a friend like you!",
  "str_voice_1400621_49": "I look up to my father a lot, and it's actually because of him that I gradually mastered my sword-fighting skills. However, he left me too soon, and my mother found it too unbearable that she... Never mind. It's nothing.",
  "str_voice_1400621_5": "Is it strange to become strong in order to protect your friends? Why do you have that fatherly smile on your face... It's not like you're a lot older than me, is it?",
  "str_voice_1400621_50": "The premature death of my parents gave me quite a blow as I was still a kid back then. It was Leah who helped me recover from the trauma. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be who I am now.",
  "str_voice_1400621_51": "I always feel kind of ashamed every time this is brought up. For a very long time, I'd thought Leah was a boy. It always makes me feel like burying myself in the ground whenever I think back to the time I spent with her.",
  "str_voice_1400621_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1400621_53": "Hello.",
  "str_voice_1400621_54": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1400621_55": "Wanna have lunch with me?",
  "str_voice_1400621_56": "I'm going to bed. You?",
  "str_voice_1400621_57": "Happy New Year. Time seems to have passed in a flash.",
  "str_voice_1400621_6": "My father was a great forest keeper. I hope I'll surpass him one day.",
  "str_voice_1400621_7": "I suppose we're friends now, since we've been working together for so long.",
  "str_voice_1400621_8": "I think there are a lot of similarities between us, like the position we're in... the people around us and the like...",
  "str_voice_1400621_9": "It's an honor to have a friend like you. I'll introduce you to everyone in the Windward Forest when I get the chance.",
  "str_voice_1400671_1": "Can the Colossus fly to the beach? I heard you can see mermaids from the shore.",
  "str_voice_1400671_10": "Where did you go, Knight of Spades and Queen of Hearts?",
  "str_voice_1400671_11": "Just wait here? Okay. I think those two will like it here, too.",
  "str_voice_1400671_12": "Is there a library nearby? I hope it has some decent fairy tale books...",
  "str_voice_1400671_13": "Some said I'd appear out of nowhere, when I'm just short and light-footed.",
  "str_voice_1400671_14": "Hopscotch is so fun, I can play it for ten days straight!",
  "str_voice_1400671_15": "Birthday time! Can I have the cake now?",
  "str_voice_1400671_16": "Not much is going on today. How about we go have some fun?",

  "str_voice_1400861_5": "To those who have been forgotten on the battlefield, your names will not be forgotten as people will pray for you. They will pray for the death of those who have forsaken you.",
  "str_voice_1400861_50": "Let me introduce her deeds first. Without knowing it, she once held a letter that would send her to the battlefield.",
  "str_voice_1400861_51": "That day, I mourned the past with deep sorrow in my heart. I bade farewell to contaminated suffering and welcomed a new life of freedom and ease.",
  "str_voice_1400861_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1400861_53": "Greetings.",
  "str_voice_1400861_54": "Good morning.",
  "str_voice_1400861_55": "It's noon already. How are you?",
  "str_voice_1400861_56": "Good evening, I've bought some white flowers.",
  "str_voice_1400861_57": "Happy New Year! I wish you a long life!",
  "str_voice_1400861_6": "I cherish the memories of the dead, express sorrow for them, praise them for their merits, and sing from my heart their past glory for a better future!",
  "str_voice_1400861_7": "Sharp thorns on one end, harmless flower vine on the other. Don't worry, because I'll naturally lean the right end towards you.",
  "str_voice_1400861_8": "I'll remember your face, your kindness, warmth, and your qualities which shall never fade. You will always live on in my heart.",
  "str_voice_1400861_9": "I've brought you some flower vines. These ones have white flowers that I like very much. May they continue to bring you warmth while I'm still alive.",
  "str_voice_1400911_1": "We are caught in the stream of fate, inching our way toward. The stream carries us without caring about our readiness.",
  "str_voice_1400911_10": "I will play better, so please stay and not go anywhere. Please, don't leave so soon...",
  "str_voice_1400911_11": "Will you leave me? Are you like a bird among the clouds or a migrating goose... I promise I won't trouble you... So, please stay.",
  "str_voice_1400911_12": "When tomorrow comes, the dark clouds will clear... May your suffering be alleviated.",
  "str_voice_1400911_13": "Please take away these tears... Dry them... And allow me to forget.",
  "str_voice_1400911_14": "I know I need to keep playing. As long as I don't stop... perhaps, my tears won't fall.",
  "str_voice_1400911_15": "Birthdays will always come as expected. May the light you saw on the first day you were born accompany you every moment.",
  "str_voice_1400911_16": "Welcome back. I hope your shadow and your voice can stay for a little longer.",
  "str_voice_1400911_17": "I hope that mornings will not always be so chilly, but be as warm as how your arrival made me felt...",
  "str_voice_1400911_18": "I heard the sound of your arrival, on the discontinuous string and in the flickering light.",
  "str_voice_1400911_19": "I so sorry, but everyday at this hour... I always find it hard to resist the urge...",
  "str_voice_1400911_2": "I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said such things... It's just that when I'm not playing my instrument, I have nowhere to hide, and I'd start remembering...",
  "str_voice_1400911_20": "The dark corners of Lumopolis bear countless wounds.",
  "str_voice_1400911_21": "I hope Illumina will bring peace. I also hope there will never be any more wars.",
  "str_voice_1400911_22": "White Night up high...",
  "str_voice_1400911_23": "It's... a dark thought that troubles me... It's a trauma of the past that can never heal.",
  "str_voice_1400911_24": "I can hear the throbbing pain derived from the unseen past sounding from the golden her...",
  "str_voice_1400911_25": "Carleen is very strong, and she can face it. I hope she's... not going to beat herself up.",
  "str_voice_1400911_26": "I like... the shoulders, reliance, protection, tranquility, and peace as I remember them to be.",
  "str_voice_1400911_27": "I don't want to face them... The nightmares, the cold, and the labyrinth... that has no exit.",
  "str_voice_1400911_28": "It has such big wings. Perhaps it'll be able to take the sadness far far away...",
  "str_voice_1400911_29": "Regrets are already musical notes, which from the very first moment, have been set to sound desolated, and onwards they have been continuously played... Nice to meet you. I'm Chloe, a musician.",
  "str_voice_1400911_3": "Sometimes I had to stop playing in the middle of my performance because of my sudden quivers... And yet, you never scold me. I am very grateful for that.",
  "str_voice_1400911_30": "The sound of music... travels further...",
  "str_voice_1400911_31": "I can relate to what the music is expressing...",
  "str_voice_1400911_32": "Will I then... be able to disentangle myself from it?",
  "str_voice_1400911_33": "Maybe I will be able to see something different from before...",
  "str_voice_1400911_34": "I'll play... Fantasia.",
  "str_voice_1400911_35": "Next piece. What shall I play...",
  "str_voice_1400911_36": "Putting in feeling into the performance...",
  "str_voice_1400911_37": "This is... the sad sound of music.",
  "str_voice_1400911_38": "In the music tells a past that haunts.",
  "str_voice_1400911_39": "I want to dispel...",
  "str_voice_1400911_4": "Even when I try not to think about it, the fear still lurks and haunt me in the form of nightmares. It just wouldn't give me a break...",
  "str_voice_1400911_40": "Dispel the gloom...",
  "str_voice_1400911_41": "If there's anything I can do...",
  "str_voice_1400911_42": "I hope it won't be gone in an instant.",
  "str_voice_1400911_43": "If it wasn't for me... who tied everyone down...",
  "str_voice_1400911_44": "How about... I'll play a piece of music and pull myself together...",
  "str_voice_1400911_45": "Not through words... I don't understand...",
  "str_voice_1400911_46": "I'll cherish this gift that didn't come easy very much.",
  "str_voice_1400911_47": "You're always giving me things...",
  "str_voice_1400911_48": "How precious! How do I cherish it enough?",
  "str_voice_1400911_49": "I'm always trying to escape into the world of music... But I know that the only way out is to talk about my sins. Straightforward and no concealing...",
  "str_voice_1400911_5": "The past is like a thread that entangles my wrists and neck, which when I finally realized that I should disentangle it, I couldn't because I didn't know how.",
  "str_voice_1400911_50": "Mother wasn't healthy enough to take the risk of pregnancy. If it wasn't for me... she could've enjoyed some tranquility...",
  "str_voice_1400911_51": "I wasn't there for him when he was facing his greatest fear. Towards the end, he had never stopped calling me...",
  "str_voice_1400911_52": "Alchemy Stars...",
  "str_voice_1400911_53": "Hey...",
  "str_voice_1400911_54": "Good morning. Are you awake?",
  "str_voice_1400911_55": "Good afternoon. There are some things I hope you could do for me...",
  "str_voice_1400911_56": "Good evening. Please take care not to catch a cold.",
  "str_voice_1400911_57": "May you be without sadness in the new year!",
  "str_voice_1400911_6": "I always dream of the day when I fall into darkness without exit. To this day, I am still a fallen leaf, with no direction, and not knowing if I am to stay or to leave...",
  "str_voice_1400911_7": "If you've made your decision, you should just go. Don't look back. Just leave me in the past, to stay watch... I will welcome you if you come back...",
  "str_voice_1400911_8": "One day, I will cease to exist. You will miss me. I hope you'd leave with that lament. Even if you were to cast it away, it's still better than having no one miss me...",
  "str_voice_1400911_9": "I sincerely hope that I would be able to keep on getting closer to my dreams... It would be like a gentle breeze, a foggy drizzle, a straight trail, or a bright path. Just like you...",
  "str_voice_1400951_1": "It's so spacious here. I don't think I'd ever see anything bigger than this for the rest of my life.",
  "str_voice_1400951_10": "Are you having a rest? I can use some rest as well.",
  "str_voice_1400951_11": "On it. One moment, please.",
  "str_voice_1400951_12": "I saw two kids selling stuff on the black market the last time I went there. Seems like everyone's having a tough time these days.",
  "str_voice_1400951_13": "I remember seeing a Caelestite or two when I was a kid. What a shame!",
  "str_voice_1400951_14": "Please be careful, or you will be targeted immediately in Umbraton.",
  "str_voice_1400951_15": "Happy birthday! Growing up is such a delight.",
  "str_voice_1400951_16": "Hello, sir. What shall we do next?",
  "str_voice_1400951_17": "Good morning. A beautiful day starts with a glass of milk.",
  "str_voice_1400951_18": "Good evening. I bartered some gadgets from the black market. Care to have a look?",
  "str_voice_1400951_19": "People as young as you should go to bed early... But I won't force you of course.",
  "str_voice_1400951_2": "People in my line of business are particular about our reputation, so there's no need for you to worry.",
  "str_voice_1400951_20": "I don't need to care about my status in Umbraton, so it isn't bad living here.",
  "str_voice_1400951_21": "I've been to Illumina several times for business. It seems to be developing fast and the people there are friendly.",
  "str_voice_1400951_22": "What would you like me to say?",
  "str_voice_1400951_23": "I've been dealing with those things for almost two decades by now. I don't feel anything about them anymore. Where did they all come from anyway?",
  "str_voice_1400951_24": "Mr. Penguin and Mr. Kuma can be entertaining when they get together. I could listen to their stand-up comedy every day.",
  "str_voice_1400951_25": "Mr. Korgon is quite nice. I'm trying to decide whether or not to move to his island in the future.",
  "str_voice_1400951_26": "I like dark and damp places and this set of gear meets my needs just right.",
  "str_voice_1400951_27": "I still don't like being disturbed, especially when I'm at home.",
  "str_voice_1400951_28": "Isn't this big fellow wonderful? Are you the only one in the world who can control the Colossus?",
  "str_voice_1400951_29": "Greetings! I am always at your service.",
  "str_voice_1400951_3": "I made this protective suit myself. I've added quite a few handy features to my design, in particular the ones that prevent scents from leaking.",
  "str_voice_1400951_30": "I've become more adept in handling my business.",
  "str_voice_1400951_31": "This feels nice. Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1400951_32": "Then I can take on more commissions.",
  "str_voice_1400951_33": "Limits are set to be broken.",
  "str_voice_1400951_34": "On my way.",
  "str_voice_1400951_35": "I have a plan.",
  "str_voice_1400951_36": "Have you got it?",
  "str_voice_1400951_37": "Now's our chance!",
  "str_voice_1400951_38": "You didn't want to pick a fight with a knife.",
  "str_voice_1400951_39": "Take this.",
  "str_voice_1400951_4": "Would you like me to give you a bottle of this stuff on my tail? It can help at critical moments but you'll need to handle it with care.",
  "str_voice_1400951_40": "What are you looking at?",
  "str_voice_1400951_41": "Good. Let's do this.",
  "str_voice_1400951_42": "That was considered easy.",
  "str_voice_1400951_43": "There's too much difference between our strengths.",
  "str_voice_1400951_44": "May I help you? Could we go somewhere shaded to talk?",
  "str_voice_1400951_45": "It's very nice of you to do this.",
  "str_voice_1400951_46": "Nice stuff!",
  "str_voice_1400951_47": "I'm very flattered.",
  "str_voice_1400951_48": "That's... I can't thank you enough.",
  "str_voice_1400951_49": "Although we're all Aurorians, there are a lot of differences among individuals. I was troubled by my constitution for a very long time but I'm good with it now.",
  "str_voice_1400951_5": "I'm getting a little tired of life as a mercenary. I've been thinking about changing my way of living but still don't have the slightest idea how.",
  "str_voice_1400951_50": "Speaking of impressive moments... What comes to mind is the time when Umbraton was under siege. I was 20 then, and I thought I was a goner.",
  "str_voice_1400951_51": "I've been feeling a little out of my depth lately. My body may still be young, but my mentality... Maybe I should consider retiring. Mr. Korgon's place is not too bad an option.",
  "str_voice_1400951_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1400951_53": "Greetings.",
  "str_voice_1400951_54": "A day's plan starts with dawn.",
  "str_voice_1400951_55": "Good afternoon. Have you had your lunch?",
  "str_voice_1400951_56": "Good evening, Navigator!",
  "str_voice_1400951_57": "Happy New Year! It will soon be a whole lot of fun here.",
  "str_voice_1400951_6": "It's too hard for someone like me to survive in this world. I'm just glad there are far more good people in Umbraton than I thought. You could say I was well taken care of.",
  "str_voice_1400951_7": "The mask? I can't take it off. This whole set of gear is one unit. It won't work if any part of it is missing.",
  "str_voice_1400951_8": "If you're considering long-term collaboration, I can give you a 20%-off discount. It's only natural to offer old clients some discounts.",
  "str_voice_1400951_9": "Care to join me at my place sometime? It's a little small but rather comfortable to live in. It'll be nice to stay in a different environment for a change.",
  "str_voice_1401011_1": "Hush, see the enemy over there? We better run while we can! Mind your step when fleeing... You know I'm joking, right?",
  "str_voice_1401011_10": "I made puzzles because I'm very bored. I just set up a trap for you. Guess where it is?",
  "str_voice_1401011_11": "Right then! Signaller Ansia, standing by to ensure timely and accurate communications... Wait, you don't need me to do that right now?",
  "str_voice_1401011_12": "I got a quick job to do, I'll come right back once I'm done!",
  "str_voice_1401011_13": "Walk this way! If you fall into my trap, I'm not helping you out... Oh, you already fell in.",
  "str_voice_1401011_14": "Oh, you want to know what the note on your back says? Well, I'm not telling you!",
  "str_voice_1401011_15": "Happy birthday! Here's your present... Haha, just kidding! Your real present is right behind you!",
  "str_voice_1401011_16": "How's the work coming along? If you need a signaller, you can call on me anytime!",
  "str_voice_1401011_17": "Morning! Need any messages sent? Nothing again, huh?",
  "str_voice_1401011_18": "Good evening! Another day is over, remember to summarize everything that needs to be reported!",
  "str_voice_1401011_19": "It's the middle of the night! No one's gonna answer your messages this late... unless I use one of my secret techniques!",
  "str_voice_1401011_2": "You lose something? Hey, don't look at me! I like playing pranks, but I don't steal... Here, I'll even help you look, if it'll clear my name!",
  "str_voice_1401011_20": "Illumina's my home, and it always will be. I'll do anything to protect it.",
  "str_voice_1401011_21": "If I'm not in Illumina, I'm in Umbraton. They appreciate my pranks a lot more there.",
  "str_voice_1401011_22": "Splendor Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1401011_23": "A day when Eclipsites no longer threaten Astra... I know that day will come.",
  "str_voice_1401011_24": "Miss Vice is incredible. So strong and dependable... I want to be just like her!",
  "str_voice_1401011_25": "I'll tell you a secret... I really want to play with Sharona's tail. I bet it would be fun!",
  "str_voice_1401011_26": "I love metal music, you know? The beat, the energy... It gets me really pumped!",
  "str_voice_1401011_27": "I can't stand unprofessional people. When you're at work, you gotta work hard!",
  "str_voice_1401011_28": "Even though I know what a Colossus is, but still, it's amazing!",
  "str_voice_1401011_29": "Testing! Testing! This is Ansia speaking. I'm the ace signaller of Illumina and thought I'd reach out first since I hadn't received any work orders from you yet!",
  "str_voice_1401011_3": "I would never play pranks at work, but I'm off-duty now, so... Don't cha wanna know what I did?",
  "str_voice_1401011_30": "Turn the volume up!",
  "str_voice_1401011_31": "Routine maintenance on our comms equipment is part of the job, too!",
  "str_voice_1401011_32": "Wanna hear about my work as a signaller? It's neat stuff!",
  "str_voice_1401011_33": "Time to boost the signal to the moon!",
  "str_voice_1401011_34": "I'll handle communications!",
  "str_voice_1401011_35": "Setting up complete!",
  "str_voice_1401011_36": "Sonic waves on standby!",
  "str_voice_1401011_37": "Supersonic!",
  "str_voice_1401011_38": "Shake 'em up!",
  "str_voice_1401011_39": "Shocked?",
  "str_voice_1401011_4": "I guess that last fight caused some problems... Oh hey, perfect timing! I'm debugging some of our devices, could you give me a hand and check the volume?",
  "str_voice_1401011_40": "Freeze!",
  "str_voice_1401011_41": "Stay in touch, everyone!",
  "str_voice_1401011_42": "It's all good!",
  "str_voice_1401011_43": "Run away!",
  "str_voice_1401011_44": "Hello? Can you hear me now? Yeah, I hear you loud and clear!",
  "str_voice_1401011_45": "A gift? Is it a jack-in-the-box?",
  "str_voice_1401011_46": "Wow! Can I really have this?",
  "str_voice_1401011_47": "I was actually hoping for a jack-in-the-box, you know!",
  "str_voice_1401011_48": "Thanks! Now, allow me to return the favor!",
  "str_voice_1401011_49": "I am never much of a fighter, but eventually I find something I am good at—communications! As a signaller, I make sure everyone stays in the know at all times!",
  "str_voice_1401011_5": "Thanks for believing in me, I'll keep working hard and doing my best! On my job AND my pranks!",
  "str_voice_1401011_50": "One time, I secretly removed the magazine from an Illumina officer's gun. He was so mad when he realized it was missing, but he couldn't do anything without ammo, so he just stormed off instead!",
  "str_voice_1401011_51": "I do recon work from time to time. No matter how dangerous the situation, signallers have to do everything in our power to ensure our messages reach their destination quickly!",
  "str_voice_1401011_52": "Alchemy Stars—!",
  "str_voice_1401011_53": "Testing, one, two, three!",
  "str_voice_1401011_54": "You got a new message!",
  "str_voice_1401011_55": "Please respond!",
  "str_voice_1401011_56": "Evening, Navigator!",
  "str_voice_1401011_57": "Happy New Year! I hope you'll get more good news in the new year!",
  "str_voice_1401011_6": "A good signaller should be patient, focused, and ready to adapt to any situation in order to communicate quickly and effectively!",
  "str_voice_1401011_7": "We interrupt your off-duty hours to bring you an urgent message: A huge caterpillar has appeared in the Navigator's room! Furthermore, I was definitely not the one who put it there!",
  "str_voice_1401011_8": "Hey Navigator? To show how much I care, starting today I'm going to give you even more surprises!",
  "str_voice_1401011_9": "A good prank can strengthen the friendship between two people, but I would never take it too far. After all, I don't want to get on your bad side!",
  "str_voice_1401021_1": "Yeah? Do you mind? If there's nothing else, please leave me alone.",
  "str_voice_1401021_10": "Whew... how easy is life...",
  "str_voice_1401021_11": "Fine. I don't know what I should do, but I'll do it anyway.",
  "str_voice_1401021_12": "I'm about to go get some rest. If there's anything you want to talk to me about, do it later.",
  "str_voice_1401021_13": "This big fellow... He's called Soroz, isn't he? I'd love to talk to him.",
  "str_voice_1401021_14": "It's much quieter here than where I live at. I'm not really used to it.",
  "str_voice_1401021_15": "Happy birthday. I didn't get you anything. It's the thought that counts, isn't it?",
  "str_voice_1401021_16": "Oh, you're here? Nothing has happened here so far. I'm having a really easy time.",
  "str_voice_1401021_17": "You're really hardworking, but you should remember to maintain a healthy work-life balance.",
  "str_voice_1401021_18": "Relax, you're off duty.",
  "str_voice_1401021_19": "You want to burn yourself out? I won't stop you anyway...",
  "str_voice_1401021_2": "The Colossus is not the only monstrosity to fly in the sky. See that floating island? You need an airship to get there.",
  "str_voice_1401021_20": "Umbraton is shambolic, but it's kind of suitable for us mavericks.",
  "str_voice_1401021_21": "I don't like how the nobles do things, but Lumopolis offers a place for them as well.",
  "str_voice_1401021_22": "The shadow is watching... everything.",
  "str_voice_1401021_23": "They probably don't know why they're fighting us, either.",
  "str_voice_1401021_24": "Dayna... She's a law onto herself. That's also how she protects Robyn.",
  "str_voice_1401021_25": "I talk when I need to, but Robyn's always quiet.",
  "str_voice_1401021_26": "What do I like? See the candy in my mouth? I like it in all flavors.",
  "str_voice_1401021_27": "I like neither claptrap nor window dressing. That's why I hate some of the nobles in Lumopolis.",
  "str_voice_1401021_28": "I thought the Colossus was merely a legend. After all, I never saw one.",
  "str_voice_1401021_29": "My name's Tessa. For the record, it is certainly important for us to cooperate, but I still hope that you would mind your own business, and I, mine.",
  "str_voice_1401021_3": "I don't like to be in contact with people. There are just too many annoying people... Anyway, why am I even bringing this up?",
  "str_voice_1401021_30": "It's kind of nice.",
  "str_voice_1401021_31": "It's so hard to control this power.",
  "str_voice_1401021_32": "It would be bad news for enemies if my power went out of control, wouldn't it?",
  "str_voice_1401021_33": "Lightning is leaping out of my hand, haha.",

  "str_voice_1401371_48": "Heh, that's what I'm waiting for.",
  "str_voice_1401371_49": "Someone opened the gate and dragged me here. If I'm correct, it's Tohru.",

  "str_voice_1401371_9": "There are people you can and cannot get along with. You can tell the latter immediately from first sight, but the former will take you some time.",
  "str_voice_1401691_1": "Welcome, sir! Sir, welcome!\nNo, no, no. \"Welcome, sir!\" sounds a bit better...\nUh, I'm still figuring out mission acceptance catchphrases.",
  "str_voice_1401691_10": "I'm very busy, you know. I skipped class this morning to read comic books and then again in the afternoon to check for new missions. Tonight I'm doing a special training course with a very impressive older girl friend of mine. I'm amazed at the fact that I'm even able to stand here so patiently right now.",
  "str_voice_1401691_11": "Standing guard is an easy task for me. Don't tell me you want me to stand here and observe you? Fine then, let me see what similarities you have with the swashbucklers...",
  "str_voice_1401691_12": "When I lower the brim of my hat, it means I'm about to act! Beware of your surroundings, because I might appear next to you at any second.",
  "str_voice_1401691_13": "I could only find work at the docks when I started out. They never resented my incredible strength! But I've gotten used to picking up fragile plates and coffee cups.",
  "str_voice_1401691_14": "No one wants to assign me anything? Shhh! Where did you hear that nonsense? I'm sure it's just a m-misunderstanding! I've accepted plenty of missions. You know, \"destroy expired products,\" \"deliver 30 beer crates at one time to the Spearows,\" that sort of thing!",
  "str_voice_1401691_15": "Happy birthday! Super Sadie Swashbuckler 666 is mentally channeling good luck and good fortune your way.",
  "str_voice_1401691_16": "Shhh! No more greetings. Get over here and keep your voice down. I don't want anyone to know we're skipping class.",
  "str_voice_1401691_17": "Good morning! Let's all be adults and get up bright and early in the morning and sleep late.",
  "str_voice_1401691_18": "Remember to eat well. I'm told vegetables build muscle. Heaven, help me. I can't stand vegetables.",
  "str_voice_1401691_19": "The swashbuckler has something to say about your work-life balance: get more sleep! Oh, who am I kidding? I made that up.",
  "str_voice_1401691_2": "Hey-o! My eyes alone pierce the veil of night and no one else can reach my height. I can't do whatever anyone else can do! ... Oh no, I sang it wrong.",
  "str_voice_1401691_20": "An excellent place for swashbucklers like me.",
  "str_voice_1401691_21": "Lumopolis? It's okay, I guess. They don't release nearly enough new swashbuckler comics there.",
  "str_voice_1401691_22": "The swashbuckler's shadow is watching you!",
  "str_voice_1401691_23": "If only there were as many comic books as there are Eclipsites. Except, uh, comic books are good and Eclipsites are bad.",
  "str_voice_1401691_24": "Allura is an incredible lady and teaches me a lot about being a courageous young swashbuckler. I really look up to her.",
  "str_voice_1401691_25": "Areia is the one who gave me baseball bat Coolster, and taught me plenty about being a dashing hero. I really respect her.",
  "str_voice_1401691_26": "Favorite things? Comic books, fashion, glittering accessories, my older friends... although they're not really \"things\" per se.",
  "str_voice_1401691_27": "I hate it when people treat me like I'm dumb—even if I do dumb things! Also, the color pink, vegetables, and rainy days.",
  "str_voice_1401691_28": "You know what'd make the Colossus cooler? If I could use it as a swashbuckler's weapon or as a special swashbuckler's transportation device.",
  "str_voice_1401691_29": "Say hello to Super Sadie Swashbuckler 666, the future No. 1 swashbuckler in all of Umbraton! Why future? I'll tell you later.",
  "str_voice_1401691_3": "Swashbuckling is the coolest job. Being a City Lord? Too tyrannical. Being a Shadowlord? Too fearsome. Being a queen? Too fantastical. Being a princess? Too tiresome. Do I know them? Of course not! But I can tell you swashbucklers are the best.",
  "str_voice_1401691_30": "I'm gaining control over my strength!",
  "str_voice_1401691_31": "Coolster grows swifter every day!",

  "str_voice_1401691_37": "Super Sadie Swashbuckler 666, ready to strike!",
  "str_voice_1401691_38": "Let my passion burn!",
  "str_voice_1401691_39": "Level swing!",
  "str_voice_1401691_4": "Am I closer to achieving my dream career as a swashbuckler? Yes! You've helped me go a lot further along that road.",
  "str_voice_1401691_40": "Bang!",
  "str_voice_1401691_41": "I'll be just as good as my seniors!",
  "str_voice_1401691_42": "Could you compliment me?",
  "str_voice_1401691_43": "Is this what happens when you don't study...?",
  "str_voice_1401691_44": "I'm on a big bird soaring far and wide, piloted by a friendly little guide.",
  "str_voice_1401691_45": "Thanks.",
  "str_voice_1401691_46": "No way! You actually...",
  "str_voice_1401691_47": "Thanks! I love it! I really love it!",
  "str_voice_1401691_48": "D-Do you want to be swashbucklers with me?",
  "str_voice_1401691_49": "My parents work in Lumopolis. They seem to like it there. I can't tell you much about the place 'cause I don't remember much from when I lived there as a little kid.",
  "str_voice_1401691_5": "You wanna know how to reach the guild? The quickest way is as the crow flies. Walk straight ahead. See that wall? Go over it. Oh, you want to go around it? I'm sorry. Just stack a few crates if you're a bit short.",
  "str_voice_1401691_50": "What made me first want to become a swashbuckler? The story starts from way back when I once skipped class and Miss Allura pulled me aside for a pointed conversation about my behavior. Yup, swashbucklers can't misbehave, you see.",
  "str_voice_1401691_51": "The first step to becoming a swashbuckler? Learning how to control your powers and building trust with your compatriots. That's what Areia taught me anyway. She's really cool.",
  "str_voice_1401691_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1401691_53": "Hey.",
  "str_voice_1401691_54": "Are you up? I was trying to slip outta here.",
  "str_voice_1401691_55": "Noon is not the best time for swashbuckling.",
  "str_voice_1401691_56": "I want to read my comics, but I'm also so tired...",
  "str_voice_1401691_57": "Happy New Year! Do you think I have a pretty good chance of making it as a successful swashbuckler this year?",
  "str_voice_1401691_6": "The dashing swashbuckler vanished into the night, leaving not a trace behind in the moonlit streets of the ancient city... All that remained was merely the grateful sobs of the poor residents whose lives were just saved. Hmm, can I one day achieve this as well? Oh? We've already done so together?",
  "str_voice_1401691_7": "Is something wrong with the ends of my hair? The color's fading, isn't it? Oh no. I just knew that hair dye was bad! Hang on, the ends of my hair are as black as ever. Then why are you staring at me?",
  "str_voice_1401691_8": "There are too many awesome, cool older girls. I've got lots to learn from them. And you're pretty cool yourself, Caelestite, for braving the dangers of the world.",
  "str_voice_1401691_9": "Would you like me to help you build muscle, lend you my swashbuckler comics, or improve your fashion sense...? None of those? Alright. I'll still do my very best to protect you—although a fee would be nice.",
  "str_voice_1500091_1": "Ah... The power of the sun is here. That's a secret door locked by the True Order—should I open it? Maybe something interesting will happen.",
  "str_voice_1500091_10": "Hope that you can hear the whispers in the sunlight... Haha, did you hear my lack of sincerity? I need some more practice.",
  "str_voice_1500091_11": "Are you finally willing to listen to those whispers with me? Oh, how interesting it is!",
  "str_voice_1500091_12": "Greetings, dear sir. Are you interested in learning about the True Order?",
  "str_voice_1500091_13": "Speaking of my fan club—the members are all considerate and lovely ladies, and I'm very grateful to them.",
  "str_voice_1500091_14": "I've always had trouble sleeping due to my failure to guide more people to follow the truth.",
  "str_voice_1500091_15": "Rejoice, for you have just been reborn!",
  "str_voice_1500091_16": "Have you decided to join us?",
  "str_voice_1500091_17": "Pray from early dawn until nightfall.",

  "str_voice_1500091_25": "I'm afraid Nails didn't hear what I said, but that won't stop us from working together happily.",
  "str_voice_1500091_26": "I have seen a lot during my travels, from which my beliefs have become stronger.",
  "str_voice_1500091_27": "For truth's sake, how could I possibly dislike anything? If I had to choose something, I would say everything other than the truth.",

  "str_voice_1500131_13": "Can I just play with the ice crystals? Just the small ones! I promise not to cause any trouble!",
  "str_voice_1500131_14": "Look, an ice boat! An ice cedar tree! And an ice miniature of... you!",
  "str_voice_1500131_15": "Happy birthday, and 900 stars from me to you! Happy?",

  "str_voice_1500131_49": "The Queen said that I could start traveling, so out I went, with my backpack, and I met many good people on my journey.",
  "str_voice_1500131_5": "Look! I can see rainbow in the ice crystal... This is not a phenomenon we get to see everyday!",

  "str_voice_1500151_29": "Hachi!\nGin.\nWe're talented art dealers and part-time mercenaries!\nI think you mean talented mercenaries and part-time art dealers...",
  "str_voice_1500151_3": "We're not producers of art!\nWe're purveyors of art!",
  "str_voice_1500151_30": "Our weapons seem to get more powerful all the time!",

  "str_voice_1500151_38": "Your life is over!",
  "str_voice_1500151_39": "How artless...",
  "str_voice_1500151_4": "You won't fetch a high price for the boring old stuff you have lying around here. Let Gin spruce up your piano with a splash of paint, eh?\nI don't think that's for sale...",
  "str_voice_1500151_40": "Now this is beauty!",
  "str_voice_1500151_41": "As long as we are together, there is no problem!",
  "str_voice_1500151_42": "Here you go!\nOne express order, straight to hell!",
  "str_voice_1500151_43": "Let's retreat and... lick our wounds...",
  "str_voice_1500151_44": "You must've spent quite a fortune for this big fellow!",
  "str_voice_1500151_45": "I would prefer more lollipops.",
  "str_voice_1500151_46": "Such exquisite taste!",
  "str_voice_1500151_47": "It's not as good as a good scratch behind the ears.\nAlright, get over here...",
  "str_voice_1500151_48": "Don't think twice—I'll even throw in our special delivery service!\nAnd for free.",
  "str_voice_1500151_49": "A lofty hairdo signifies the highest standards of taste! I'm 3 centimeters taller—so I'm as tall as Gin now, right? Still no??\nNot even close.",
  "str_voice_1500151_5": "Only those who truly understand art can see the value of these old paintings. So... Which one would you like?\nI don't think anyone would buy them, either.",
  "str_voice_1500151_50": "I know what kind of job this is. Gin's talent shouldn't stop at forgery... But we won't stop until we save up enough Nightium.",
  "str_voice_1500151_51": "Sometimes I dream of the old days... That painting of the beautiful blue sky, the canvas stretching across the entire wall... The figure of our father is still so clear in my mind.",

  "str_voice_1500151_57": "Happy New Year!\nWell, at least have a happy day.",
  "str_voice_1500151_6": "Same clothes every day... Basic hairstyle... Would you like some tips on sprucing up your hair?",
  "str_voice_1500151_7": "Sometimes, those complex, grand ideas need to be expressed more simply and directly...\nSo, what are we eating later?",
  "str_voice_1500151_8": "What happens if we fail to ship an order? That's strictly confidential! All I can say is that Gin is a very skilled forger...\nThat's all you needed to say...",
  "str_voice_1500151_9": "I forget the joke about the lollipop... even though it's on the tip of my tongue! Hahaha... wasn't that funny? And here I thought our new routine was ready for the stage...",
  "str_voice_1500181_1": "Did you listen to Barbara's latest album yet? It's so bad it should be thrown in an incinerator. The band sounds like garbage!",
  "str_voice_1500181_10": "I'm bored! Who took my guitar? Oh, he'd better get ready to be scorched...",
  "str_voice_1500181_11": "Center stage? Humph. The spotlight has always been mine.",
  "str_voice_1500181_12": "Can I, the destroyer, also be a protector?",

  "str_voice_1500181_18": "Seriously? You're asking me to do this?",
  "str_voice_1500181_19": "It's too quiet at night. Unacceptable! Need a lil rock 'n' roll to raise some spirits!",
  "str_voice_1500181_2": "You really want to chat with me? Fine. What kind of music do you like? You better think it over. I'm not associating myself with someone who has no taste.",

  "str_voice_1500211_46": "Eek—! W-where did you get this?!",
  "str_voice_1500211_47": "Appreciation is bigger than love. Thank you.",

  "str_voice_1500211_5": "I see my love flowing in the veins of each flower. I will build a cage most delicate for them, just like for that child.",
  "str_voice_1500211_50": "I've experienced shock, resentment, and loneliness, but now I just can't stop missing her. The only thing that hasn't changed is love, for love is eternal.",
  "str_voice_1500211_51": "I have built an ovary most splendid and warm for her. She can come home any time following the fragrance of love, and I will open my arms wide for her, regardless of the past.",

  "str_voice_1500211_8": "My fence represents love, embrace, and sacrifice! She doesn't understand my intentions. Do you? You understand, right?!",
  "str_voice_1500211_9": "Such strong love! I'm afraid you're the only person who understands me in this world, like how the high mountains and flowing rivers resonate! Come closer—it's time to share some secrets with you...",
  "str_voice_1500241_1": "- Who are Caelestites?\n- They are a race different from the Aurorians.",

  "str_voice_1500241_16": "What do you usually do during the day? By the way, I just finished my self-training.",
  "str_voice_1500241_17": "You're up early, a lot earlier than that nerd.",

  "str_voice_1500241_20": "- How do I feel about the Illumina? I don't feel anything about it because I know nothing about the place.\n- Unity is what makes the Illumina special.",
  "str_voice_1500241_21": "- I like Umbraton more than Lumopolis. It's not so much about being cosmetic there.\n- For once, I agree with you.",
  "str_voice_1500241_22": "Splendor Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1500241_23": "- No one knows where they came from.\n- Why do they pick on the Aurorians? I don't get it.",
  "str_voice_1500241_24": "- General Barton is quite gallant.\n- I'm going to be just like him!",
  "str_voice_1500241_25": "- White Dwarf? One boring fellow.\n- Everyone's different.",
  "str_voice_1500241_26": "- I like fighting and winning!\n- I like winning, too.",
  "str_voice_1500241_27": "- Only cowards fight dirty!\n- They have no dignity to speak of.",
  "str_voice_1500241_28": "- What a big fellow! He must be powerful!\n- I'm so blown away seeing this legacy of the past for myself.",
  "str_voice_1500241_29": "- Hi. Nice to see you.\n- Get the most powerful person here to come out!",
  "str_voice_1500241_3": "- Listen up. This side of the line is my territory!\n- How dumb!",
  "str_voice_1500241_30": "Good. Buck up!",
  "str_voice_1500241_31": "I've become stronger!",
  "str_voice_1500241_32": "It's a very reasonable decision.",
  "str_voice_1500241_33": "- Perfect!\n- Super perfect!",
  "str_voice_1500241_34": "Roger that!",
  "str_voice_1500241_35": "Let's wreak some havoc!",
  "str_voice_1500241_36": "Please make sure you pick the right moment.",
  "str_voice_1500241_37": "Grit your teeth!",
  "str_voice_1500241_38": "- It's time.\n- Coming!",
  "str_voice_1500241_39": "Kaboom!",
  "str_voice_1500241_4": "- I'm getting closer to defeating you.\n- You're not the only one who's improving, nerd.",
  "str_voice_1500241_40": "Hahahahaha!",
  "str_voice_1500241_41": "- I am the captain!\n- Behave yourself.",
  "str_voice_1500241_42": "- Piece of cake!\n- Mission accomplished.",
  "str_voice_1500241_43": "- It burns me!\n- We're lucky to still be alive.",
  "str_voice_1500241_44": "- Hmm? You wanted to see me or her?\n- Can I help you?",
  "str_voice_1500241_45": "Thanks for your concern, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1500241_46": "This is it! You know me!",
  "str_voice_1500241_47": "Not bad. I'll take it.",
  "str_voice_1500241_48": "I'll cherish it. Thanks.",
  "str_voice_1500241_49": "- Aw, I'm suddenly missing the time when I first joined Illumina.\n- You were so much harder to discipline back then.\n- Excuse me?!",
  "str_voice_1500241_5": "- Honestly, I'm not interested in being promoted. Just let me fight.\n- You should think about your future more.",
  "str_voice_1500241_50": "- More and more of our duels end in a draw lately. At this rate, I'll beat you sooner or later!\n- In your dreams.",
  "str_voice_1500241_51": "- You often fail to sense the danger around you when you fight. It will prove fatal.\n- Get off my back! That's because I wasn't fighting on my own!",

  "str_voice_1500241_53": "Hey, you!",

  "str_voice_1500241_6": "- Ha-ha-ha, I'm the best!\n- Then I'm the best of the best.",
  "str_voice_1500241_7": "- You can't fight but you're nice.\n- Don't take her words seriously.",
  "str_voice_1500241_8": "- It's showtime, Curo!\n- Let's have the Caelestite witness your defeat then.",
  "str_voice_1500241_9": "- I've got nothing to do... Ugh... Isn't there anything for me to do?\n- Stop rolling around on the bed like a fool.",
  "str_voice_1500331_1": "Unfortunately, the Colossus doesn't come with a manual, so hands-on is the only way! Hm? That actually sounds right, since... since... Wait. Just give me a sec.",
  "str_voice_1500331_10": "How many things are left on the agenda? Just keep it up a bit more... You should take a break. You deserve it.",
  "str_voice_1500331_11": "Just leave them to me. I'll handle everything! It'd be great if you could help me out, though!",
  "str_voice_1500331_12": "Need help? Let me help you out! I've memorized the entire \"Emergency Response Protocol,\" after all!",
  "str_voice_1500331_13": "Motion sickness from flying? No worries! Just take a nap. I had the same problem when I first got on the Colossus.",
  "str_voice_1500331_14": "Someone had shone a light upon my world, adding something that is indestructible.",
  "str_voice_1500331_15": "Hide it, then turn off the light, and the present is ready... Huh? How long have you been there?",
  "str_voice_1500331_16": "Welcome back! Good job! So... I'll take a break and take the later shift.",
  "str_voice_1500331_17": "You awake? I've completed the scheduled communication. Let's discuss about today's schedule!",
  "str_voice_1500331_18": "Another thing, the report on the Colossus is almost ready... possibly ahead of schedule...",
  "str_voice_1500331_19": "I didn't think you'd overtime until this hour... You really are very dedicated!",
  "str_voice_1500331_2": "Being able to activate the Colossus together means that we're meant to be... so there's no reason to keep holding a grudge over damaging the Colossus... right?",
  "str_voice_1500331_20": "An excellent system with equal learning opportunities. I'm very lucky to have been adopted by the Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1500331_21": "My experience in Lumopolis has taught me much. Only if you'd been there!",
  "str_voice_1500331_22": "Splendor Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1500331_23": "Everyone has a reason to take up arms... and I as well.",
  "str_voice_1500331_24": "Though Charon seems like a loose thread, he does have many good qualities, such as... err, let me get back to you on that.",
  "str_voice_1500331_25": "Although she's quite a headache herself, but her research will... well, make your head hurt even more.",
  "str_voice_1500331_26": "Lullabies and piano keys... These are all very sophisticated, aren't they?",
  "str_voice_1500331_27": "I hate failures, especially when... I could almost taste my success but ultimately failed because of naivety.",
  "str_voice_1500331_28": "The Colossus may seem like a tool or weapon to most, but I feel it's more like a friend, right?",
  "str_voice_1500331_29": "I'm Vice! You do remember me, right? Oh... great! For a moment there, I was worried that I make absolutely no impression on anybody!",
  "str_voice_1500331_3": "Today's combat plans are... Hmm? Too loud? Sorry... I figured the louder, the better... Guess not, huh?",
  "str_voice_1500331_30": "I can be stronger!",
  "str_voice_1500331_31": "Is an unknown fate awaiting me up ahead?",
  "str_voice_1500331_32": "The greatest blessing and bliss really are here.",
  "str_voice_1500331_33": "Forward! To the mysterious future!",
  "str_voice_1500331_34": "I will try harder!",
  "str_voice_1500331_35": "Ready and long have been ready!",
  "str_voice_1500331_36": "Want a manual to go with that?",
  "str_voice_1500331_37": "I'll hold nothing back!",
  "str_voice_1500331_38": "Time for the meaningless battle to end!",
  "str_voice_1500331_39": "Target tracking!",
  "str_voice_1500331_4": "I will no longer look down upon myself because I have solved the mystery and found my worth. I will not let the past repeat itself again...",
  "str_voice_1500331_40": "Never lost!",
  "str_voice_1500331_41": "Take lead? Sure! Truly!",
  "str_voice_1500331_42": "Ha! Never had a doubt!",
  "str_voice_1500331_43": "Let's retreat first... Live to fight another day.",
  "str_voice_1500331_44": "Whoa! God! What is this, a game of heart attack?",
  "str_voice_1500331_45": "A present for me? What's the occasion?",
  "str_voice_1500331_46": "To build rapport? I see!",
  "str_voice_1500331_47": "Thanks! I don't dislike it. Really!",
  "str_voice_1500331_48": "You better look forward to my present for you!",
  "str_voice_1500331_49": "I once wanted to be a shining beacon of hope, until that dream shattered... It's okay. I don't plan on giving up even if I lose my talents and gifts.",
  "str_voice_1500331_5": "My growing strength will bring me victories... Even if I have nightmares I can't get rid of, they shall not stop me from becoming stronger!",
  "str_voice_1500331_50": "Fate may be cruel, but it is never without hope. I mean, you are here for me now, aren't you? You can always take me as your hope too if you don't mind...",
  "str_voice_1500331_51": "Have you ever thought about what will happen to the world when all the secrets regarding us, the Eclipsites, and the entire sky have been revealed? Would you still be able to... keep your faith?",
  "str_voice_1500331_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1500331_53": "You there, my trusty partner?",
  "str_voice_1500331_54": "Good morning! How are you feeling?",
  "str_voice_1500331_55": "You don't take lunch breaks, do you?",
  "str_voice_1500331_56": "Good job at work!",
  "str_voice_1500331_57": "I look forward to working with you in the coming year!",
  "str_voice_1500331_6": "I shall forever keep my faith, which will shine valiantly like aurora in the night!",
  "str_voice_1500331_7": "Why weren't you able to activate the Colossus? Generally speaking, finding the right way solves everything... So, I'm... the right way?",
  "str_voice_1500331_8": "I had to always be on full alert back when I ran solo quests, but now I finally have a partner! One that doesn't cost me a penny! Oh... how about something for your service then?",
  "str_voice_1500331_9": "I guess I wanted to know more about the two of you because we've had each other's backs for a bit. I truly wish you two the best!",
  "str_voice_1500361_1": "You seem to be able to talk to them... Many people end up going mad. Don't mind it, it's nothing.",
  "str_voice_1500361_10": "Wow, hmm, whatever... I'm so bored... Will someone please put an end to everything?",
  "str_voice_1500361_11": "Please get someone else instead if possible. Even my hounds refuse to stay here.",
  "str_voice_1500361_12": "Now what? You must be here for something, right?",
  "str_voice_1500361_13": "This place is more boring than I expected... Aren't you the master of this place? Do something.",

  "str_voice_1500361_15": "Geez, what a pain... This is so pointless. Just tell me what you want.",
  "str_voice_1500361_16": "Oh, you're back. I thought you had gone missing.",
  "str_voice_1500361_17": "You're diligent, but so what? It has nothing to do with me...",
  "str_voice_1500361_18": "Are you going out or not? Make it snappy and stop wasting time.",
  "str_voice_1500361_19": "Why are you still awake when even my hounds are asleep? Whatever... I'm not waiting for you... What else are you going to do?",
  "str_voice_1500361_2": "Say what you want to say; I'm listening. Before the boss returns, I have all the time in the world to pretend to be listening to you.",
  "str_voice_1500361_20": "There was time that people like me are fit for only Umbraton. Now, it's people like me should be in Umbraton.",

  "str_voice_1500361_22": "Tsk, the shadows are always watching you.",
  "str_voice_1500361_23": "Eclipsites? Should I care about them? My shadows will swarm and surround them, gnawing them to death. The end.",
  "str_voice_1500361_24": "Don't know, don't care. The one in Umbraton is an octopus, something that should have gone extinct ages ago.",
  "str_voice_1500361_25": "Tsk, I don't know why that long worm gets so fired up every day...",
  "str_voice_1500361_26": "Likes? Hmm... Spicy food, hounds, and no one bothering me.",
  "str_voice_1500361_27": "I dislike those who think they know everything.",
  "str_voice_1500361_28": "Is this your home? It doesn't matter. I have stayed overnight at someone else's place before.",
  "str_voice_1500361_29": "I didn't expect that you could find me. It's such a pain to introduce myself. Just read this for yourself.",
  "str_voice_1500361_3": "Existence is meaningless, especially when you understand its meaning. You don't get it? That's normal. Even the boss don't get it.",

  "str_voice_1500361_4": "Just like how shadows overlap, darkness gathers and becomes denser... That thing that was cut off and regenerated is about to collapse. You don't need to know about this.",
  "str_voice_1500361_40": "Devour!",
  "str_voice_1500361_41": "Captain? Seriously?",
  "str_voice_1500361_42": "Those are called weaklings.",
  "str_voice_1500361_43": "Are you frustrated? Sorry, but I don't care.",
  "str_voice_1500361_44": "How troublesome... Just give up. I won't react to it.",
  "str_voice_1500361_45": "Oh. Wow. A gift... I REALLY wanted this...",
  "str_voice_1500361_46": "...Ha! Did you make a lucky guess? I'm kind of looking forward to this.",
  "str_voice_1500361_47": "Tsk, fine, I'll take it. OH SO HAPPY I AM.",
  "str_voice_1500361_48": "You know what I want, just like usual.",
  "str_voice_1500361_49": "Many things are unimportant to me, like clothes and relatives. They'll all leave sooner or later. Don't try to refute me because I'm right.",
  "str_voice_1500361_5": "It doesn't matter whether it is a hound or a wolf, or whether it is a shadow or something real. You don't need to be interested in this... Just look at it.",
  "str_voice_1500361_50": "Bonds are simply ridiculous. People who want you to pursue something unrealistic inject this notion into your head and imprison you with it. Sorry, but I'm not going to believe in it.",
  "str_voice_1500361_51": "I won't rule out the possibility that I'll end up in a very cliché situation one day, but it's highly unlikely. Just wait and see. That's all the files. Stop tapping. That's all. Geez!",
  "str_voice_1500361_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1500361_53": "Hello, you there?",

  "str_voice_1500361_56": "Are you asleep? I'll wait for two minutes.",
  "str_voice_1500361_57": "Tsk, it's New Year now; so what?",
  "str_voice_1500361_6": "Do you see them? They are beautiful, quiet, and everywhere. The one behind you is the same yet completely different.",
  "str_voice_1500361_7": "You have nothing to worry about if you have doubts about my ability. I have more important things to do than to use shadows to deal with you.",
  "str_voice_1500361_8": "Hmm... I think I'm starting to appreciate you. Do you know that your shadow has a scent now? Stay away from me. I don't want to smell it.",
  "str_voice_1500361_9": "I don't want to admit it, but you're similar to big bro. You're both masters of shadows and walk freely among shadows in the world of light and darkness.",
  "str_voice_1500421_1": "What's the ironjaw for? The last person asking about it had his head cracked like a walnut, that's what it's for!",
  "str_voice_1500421_10": "What a great weekend! Did you come to play chess with me? No? Then leave me alone to play solo.",
  "str_voice_1500421_11": "Ahha! You want me to watch over you! Would you be bored to death otherwise?",
  "str_voice_1500421_12": "I heard the rookie camp in the Illumina is regressing from bad to worse. Are the drill instructors doing nothing at all? At this pace, they'll end up being nothing more than live targets in a fight!",
  "str_voice_1500421_13": "If you're that bored, get some training in so you won't drop the ball at crunch time.",
  "str_voice_1500421_14": "Soldiers are nothing without war. I definitely do not want to be a parasite that contributes nothing.",
  "str_voice_1500421_15": "You want to celebrate your birthday? How about some special drills just for you? I promise you'll feel you've been reborn...",
  "str_voice_1500421_16": "It's too quiet around here. I wanna shoot something!!",
  "str_voice_1500421_17": "Get up, ya lazy bum! This is not your grandma's comfy, cozy house!",
  "str_voice_1500421_18": "It's been a day and no enemy in sight. I'm bored! Go get me an eclipsite or two to fight!",
  "str_voice_1500421_19": "It's been a long time since I trained overnight... Since you're here, should we do it together?",
  "str_voice_1500421_2": "Why don't you give Colossus a feminine name? That way, you will never leave her alone on the battlefield.",
  "str_voice_1500421_20": "The Illumina has been focusing on trades lately. Sending bean-counters to war is a terrible idea. They're just begging for an utter defeat.",
  "str_voice_1500421_21": "Get a load of the old-school knights from Lumopolis! What are they thinking, demanding duels in a battle?",
  "str_voice_1500421_22": "Splendor Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1500421_23": "Given lousy commanders, incompetent officers, and soldiers blindly following orders, what else can you expect other than a motley crew?",
  "str_voice_1500421_24": "Why does Hiiro drone on about Bushido? Silly! You're supposed to sneak attack in a war!",
  "str_voice_1500421_25": "Given a chance, I'll definitely tell Reinhardt: Enough with the proper rest, time to get ready for war!",
  "str_voice_1500421_26": "Peace? Pshaw! People typically are bums, anyway, and only war can make them feel worthwhile!",
  "str_voice_1500421_27": "The ultimate fate of a soldier is that one bullet with their name on it. Otherwise, there's only boredom in between.",
  "str_voice_1500421_28": "I want a colossus too! Would be nice to drop a few missiles on its dome!",
  "str_voice_1500421_29": "I heard there are many battles to fight! I'm Barton, legion commander of the Illumina Federation Army. Let's go take out the trash right now!",
  "str_voice_1500421_3": "Think I'm ridiculous!? Only God knows who else awaits us in the future. War is constantly around us!",
  "str_voice_1500421_30": "Let me beat them back!",
  "str_voice_1500421_31": "My sword has become sharper.",
  "str_voice_1500421_32": "Old soldiers never die.",
  "str_voice_1500421_33": "I alone am a legion!",
  "str_voice_1500421_34": "Yes!",
  "str_voice_1500421_35": "Lock and loaded.",
  "str_voice_1500421_36": "It's party time!",
  "str_voice_1500421_37": "I'll end you with Barton's Army Sword!",
  "str_voice_1500421_38": "Come shower in my bullets!",
  "str_voice_1500421_39": "Sherman - Modified!",
  "str_voice_1500421_4": "Never kill someone with a knife when a gun will do. I'll ask Gronru for some armor-piercing rounds later and blow them to hell.",
  "str_voice_1500421_40": "Down with all of you!",
  "str_voice_1500421_41": "Follow me and kill them all!",
  "str_voice_1500421_42": "This bunch of garbage is no match for me!",
  "str_voice_1500421_43": "Retreat, but we'll be back!",
  "str_voice_1500421_44": "I'm bored. How about we play a wargame?",
  "str_voice_1500421_45": "Ah, thank you.",
  "str_voice_1500421_46": "Not bad. I'll consider using it.",
  "str_voice_1500421_47": "This is extremely valuable. I'll take it.",
  "str_voice_1500421_48": "Haha! This is as satisfying as fighting!",
  "str_voice_1500421_49": "The battles now are cakewalks compared to a few years back... That was a real war! I'll tell you about it someday.",
  "str_voice_1500421_5": "More training leads to less dying in battles.",
  "str_voice_1500421_50": "Only war can turn me into a legion commander at my age. Pango, on the other hand, wasn't so lucky. Somebody's bound to take a bullet in a fight, you know.",
  "str_voice_1500421_51": "Don't underestimate the Four Angels of Lumopolis. Those lasses fight like tigers. I got to figure out how to neutralize them...",

  "str_voice_1500421_53": "Hey, you here?",
  "str_voice_1500421_54": "Morning!",
  "str_voice_1500421_55": "Are you free?",
  "str_voice_1500421_56": "Are you asleep?",
  "str_voice_1500421_57": "New Year's here!",
  "str_voice_1500421_6": "People said bullets could hit anyone. What a pity they always ducked me, ha!",
  "str_voice_1500421_7": "Nice weather today. Why don't you come on a cross-country training with me?",
  "str_voice_1500421_8": "No one will treat you fairly and equally in a battle. Use whatever dirty tricks it takes to win! How about I show you some of them?",
  "str_voice_1500421_9": "Let's see your battle face... What? That's the best you can do? Ha! Such a newbie!",
  "str_voice_1500424_1": "You want to know about my past? Sit down, I have all the time in the world. When I was young... even I myself thought I was a bastard.",
  "str_voice_1500424_10": "Tired? That's okay. I can still run with you on my back. So, let's get going!",
  "str_voice_1500424_11": "Can't function without supervision? Well, lucky for you, supervising is my expertise!",
  "str_voice_1500424_12": "I've always believed that guns are more powerful than blades. Why do I use blades, then? It's a long story. Let's just say Officer Pango spent a lot of effort teaching me the art of the blade.",
  "str_voice_1500424_13": "It's probably not my place to say so, but you should cherish those around you. Don't let those who've helped you go too far. Keep them close, for those are your comrades.",
  "str_voice_1500424_14": "Why do I treat you special? I know a hero when I see one. I don't mind going to bat for you when the going gets tough.",
  "str_voice_1500424_16": "You think I can pilot the Colossus or something? Oh, you don't? Then what are you waiting for? Get us to the Eclipsites before my patience runs out!",
  "str_voice_1500424_17": "Get in line, you lazy bum!",
  "str_voice_1500424_18": "We used to all scramble to the mess hall at this time. If we dawdled around like you, we'd have starved.",
  "str_voice_1500424_19": "Sufficient sleep ensures a functioning soldier. Go to bed. I'll keep watch.",
  "str_voice_1500424_2": "The Eclipsites are here! The Eclipsites are here! Don't stop me. Somebody has to sound the bugle every now and then, or complacency will kill them!",
  "str_voice_1500424_3": "Have you heard of sharpened rounds? We polish them to the max and make sure they're usable at the same time. We save them for only the most dire of situations...",
  "str_voice_1500424_35": "My blade is unsheathed!",
  "str_voice_1500424_36": "No compromise!",
  "str_voice_1500424_37": "Steel shell!",
  "str_voice_1500424_38": "Sharpened alloy round!",
  "str_voice_1500424_39": "Obliterate them!",
  "str_voice_1500424_40": "Fire at will!",
  "str_voice_1500424_44": "Tired? Wanna have some fun?",
  "str_voice_1500424_58": "The 2nd Legion never backs down!",
  "str_voice_1500424_59": "Following orders is my job. Too bad I'm the rebellious type.",
  "str_voice_1500424_60": "Keep charging! We shall not stop until all Eclipsites are exterminated!",
  "str_voice_1500424_61": "Let's do a military simulation.",
  "str_voice_1500424_62": "Teenage girls are all monsters.",
  "str_voice_1500424_63": "Show them what you're made of!",
  "str_voice_1500424_64": "Dozed off accidentally. Good thing no one saw me.",
  "str_voice_1500424_65": "I can go faster. Barton, you can do it!",
  "str_voice_1500424_66": "Ah, interesting.",
  "str_voice_1500424_67": "I didn't expect that old man to be photogenic.",
  "str_voice_1500424_68": "Follow me and show them how Illuminans do it!",
  "str_voice_1500424_69": "Damn, you got the spotlight this time...",
  "str_voice_1500424_70": "Reinhardt's changed. They've all changed... It's gotten too complicated for me to comprehend...",
  "str_voice_1500424_71": "This is nothing. I haven't even used the sharpened rounds yet! I can't agree to it...",
  "str_voice_1500551_1": "If you have a problem, we shall meet in the Hall of Justice. Procedure is the blindfold of justice, so I won't be partial to either side.",
  "str_voice_1500551_10": "Catching fugitives is my favorite pastime. Would you like to try it, too? Hmm... You'd better work on your physique before joining me, though.",
  "str_voice_1500551_11": "As long as I have a surface on which to read my files, I don't care where I end up. This place is very spacious. It suits me perfectly.",

  "str_voice_1500551_13": "There are many injustices recorded in my notes. But what of it? Anyway, I'll solve them one by one.",
  "str_voice_1500551_14": "Follow the guidance of the God of Light. God will make you see your heart—be kind to others and to yourself.",
  "str_voice_1500551_15": "Happy birthday. The God of Light blesses all law-abiding people with happiness and protection.",
  "str_voice_1500551_16": "It's time for work now. If you'd like to talk about something unrelated to work, please leave it until break time.",
  "str_voice_1500551_17": "Good morning. At this time, while my head is clear, I usually sort through the unsolved matters in my mind.",
  "str_voice_1500551_18": "The day is coming to an end. I wish I had more time.",
  "str_voice_1500551_19": "You plan on staying up late, too? This kind of schedule is too much for anyone to bear.",
  "str_voice_1500551_2": "There is no doubt that the almighty God of Light is the creator of all things, and the savior of all life. There is nothing difficult to understand—just remember this truth.",
  "str_voice_1500551_20": "Like the eternal God of Light, Lumopolis will never fall!",
  "str_voice_1500551_21": "The True Order? They brazenly use the word truth to confuse the public. I'm afraid the God of Light will never forgive them.",
  "str_voice_1500551_22": "White Night up high!",
  "str_voice_1500551_23": "When I see an Eclipsite, I make sure to put it in its place. They can be found guilty without trial.",
  "str_voice_1500551_24": "Back then, I never imagined that she would become a member of the True Order...",
  "str_voice_1500551_25": "My senior at the academy and my senior at work... The Chief Judge has always been ahead of me.",
  "str_voice_1500551_26": "We each have our own position and duty, and the beauty of order is irreplaceable.",
  "str_voice_1500551_27": "To go beyond all rules, systems, and laws—there is nothing more detestable.",
  "str_voice_1500551_28": "There are no laws here on the Colossus at present... I think it's time to make one.",
  "str_voice_1500551_29": "Since the God of Light has arranged for us to meet, then... Hello, I'm Wayne Pittman, a judge of the Lumo Hall of Justice.",
  "str_voice_1500551_3": "You wish to sit in on one of my trials? Sorry, I can't authorize that. You'll need to go to the Hall of Justice to register and verify your identity. Rules are rules.",

  "str_voice_1500551_49": "Back then, all I could do was lie in bed all day. It was the God of Light who saved me. The God of Light illuminated my soul with righteousness and guided me to spread this righteousness across the land... though I have yet to truly fulfill God's will.",

  "str_voice_1500551_51": "Reading through files always results in unexpected discoveries. Not only does it help me to work more effectively, it also brings me closer to the truth behind the rebellion. Of course, it's also interesting to look at the judgments made in different regions.",

  "str_voice_1500551_6": "Huh? Take a look, if you want. These mechanical bones were customized by Illumina. Without them, my whole left arm would be no more.",
  "str_voice_1500551_7": "Many people prefer to achieve their goals through political means rather than by improving their abilities. In my opinion, you seem to be different from those people.",

  "str_voice_1500561_1": "Just listen closely, and be patient. After that, you can just kill off the Eclipsites, solo. Hmm? What do I mean by solo? It means to fight them all by yourself, of course! It's very easy.",
  "str_voice_1500561_10": "It's a lovely day. All that's missing is a nice snowstorm... Hmm? Is that weird?",
  "str_voice_1500561_11": "Need help? Sure, you did help me with the notes before.",

  "str_voice_1500711_12": "Enough. You've seen enough. Or do you want to try this?",
  "str_voice_1500711_13": "Since you have so much free time, you should go do your own stuff.",

  "str_voice_1500711_19": "You're a real tour de force, kid, still working so hard at this hour. Wanna have a drink with me?",
  "str_voice_1500711_2": "Of course there is a commission fee. How much? It depends on the contents.",
  "str_voice_1500711_20": "Umbraton is a good place to gather intel, and no one there talks crap. I like it.",
  "str_voice_1500711_21": "I'll join Rediesel Wrench after I find out the secrets of the necklace. I'm quite fond of those people.",
  "str_voice_1500711_22": "The shadow is watching you.",
  "str_voice_1500711_23": "A bunch of trash with absolutely no wits. They have no value to speak of.",
  "str_voice_1500711_24": "Istvan is really good at managing Umbraton. It's rather peaceful here with him around.",
  "str_voice_1500711_25": "I wonder how the little pink-haired girl is doing. Ah, to hell with it. I'm not gonna think about it.",
  "str_voice_1500711_26": "Having booze to drink is enough for me in this lifetime.",
  "str_voice_1500711_27": "There were a few part-timers here, but I fired them because they talked too much.",
  "str_voice_1500711_28": "This bloke is too big. I can't even find my way around in here. And there are way too many identical rooms.",
  "str_voice_1500711_29": "Is there something you want to commission me to do, kid? It better not be anything trivial. There are only so many things the Odd Jobs can get done in a day, so I must be very selective.",
  "str_voice_1500711_3": "Don't you think running an Odd Jobs is easy... I always have to host strange people, like that guy with a dog and the guy with tentacles.",
  "str_voice_1500711_30": "Not bad.",
  "str_voice_1500711_31": "Humph, it was nothing but a child's play.",
  "str_voice_1500711_32": "I'm getting closer... to finding out the secrets of the necklace.",
  "str_voice_1500711_33": "Blood pumping... It's been a while since I've been this fired up!",
  "str_voice_1500711_34": "Oh, we're doing this?",
  "str_voice_1500711_35": "It's time.",
  "str_voice_1500711_36": "Watch this!",
  "str_voice_1500711_37": "Burn them all!",
  "str_voice_1500711_38": "Incinerate everything!",
  "str_voice_1500711_39": "It's over.",
  "str_voice_1500711_4": "My strength is definitely getting stronger, but I am still far from finding out the secret of the necklace.",
  "str_voice_1500711_40": "Too slow!",
  "str_voice_1500711_41": "I'm not used to leading a team.",
  "str_voice_1500711_42": "It wasn't even difficult.",
  "str_voice_1500711_43": "Defeated? It's part of everyday life.",
  "str_voice_1500711_44": "If you have something to say, just say it. Stop faffing about.",
  "str_voice_1500711_45": "Are you trying to bribe me?",
  "str_voice_1500711_46": "You've got quite an eye for stuff.",
  "str_voice_1500711_47": "I'll take it. Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1500711_48": "This is—! Thanks, kid.",
  "str_voice_1500711_49": "The world is not very friendly to those who are different. Some are even treated badly just because of their looks, but it's a lot better here in Umbraton.",
  "str_voice_1500711_5": "No one at the Odd Jobs can work with you to save the world, so save your breath and stop looking.",
  "str_voice_1500711_50": "To this day, the time I spent in the Far East still feels like yesterday. The teachings of my master still echo in my mind, and there was this pink-haired girl whom I somehow care about.",
  "str_voice_1500711_51": "This necklace... is something I've been carrying around since I could remember. It's a legacy from my parents and is also the source of my power. There are so many secrets behind it, but I don't know any of them.",

  "str_voice_1500711_53": "Hey.",

  "str_voice_1500711_56": "Sleep now, kid. Don't stay up late.",
  "str_voice_1500711_57": "Happy New Year, kid. This discount coupon is for you.",
  "str_voice_1500711_6": "There is no equality in this world. There is no equality where there are people.",
  "str_voice_1500711_7": "You're a really weird kid, but I don't dislike you.",
  "str_voice_1500711_8": "You're nothing like those brats in the Far East. What? It's unusual of me to compliment you, so just accept it.",
  "str_voice_1500711_9": "Not many people in Umbraton are willing to build relationships with others. Everyone is held back by one thing or another, which makes it very hard for them to think about anything other than survival.",
  "str_voice_1500751_1": "Holy crap, I want to hack those dumbass Rediesel Wrench heads for real! At least change Sandworms to normal breakfast!",
  "str_voice_1500751_10": "The cables are set and the comms checked. Pardon me for being blunt, everybody here is nothing but... What the... Why is it going haywire again? What's the bug this time?",
  "str_voice_1500751_11": "Yes, I'll hack all the comm channels in a 10-mile radius for you today... What? That's not necessary? But I'm already halfway done...",
  "str_voice_1500751_12": "Cooping up here reminds me of that lame lizard in Rediesel and that silly girl's complaints... What a headache.",
  "str_voice_1500751_13": "They don't even writhe as well as my cables... How about a little more effort, fellas?",
  "str_voice_1500751_14": "Those clowns on the team always ruin their equipment. There's no \"cherish\" in their dictionaries.",

  "str_voice_1500751_16": "I knew you'd be back two minutes and fifteen seconds ago. This is the comm tech of a genius, see?",
  "str_voice_1500751_17": "How do I stop this lousy colossus? Whoa, why is it shaking now?",
  "str_voice_1500751_18": "What's the problem? I'll handle it, piece of cake... Oops, no I won't, you keep at it!",
  "str_voice_1500751_19": "You're just in time, someone's yapping on the comm... That fella wants to fight you in Gannon City!",
  "str_voice_1500751_2": "Never estimate a tech personnel. If I wanted to, I could even turn the ground upside down... You can still fly? Well then, I'll break your wings off!",
  "str_voice_1500751_20": "Why I joined the Rediesel Wrench? Can't be easily summarized, but I hung around long enough that I ended up staying.",
  "str_voice_1500751_21": "How about some quests, preferably something like hacking the Illumina comm... What's there to be afraid of? Just finding bugs in the system for them.",

  "str_voice_1500751_25": "Tell him to try if he thinks he's that good! Look at how smug he is, even though Tiny One and I are doing all the fixing for Rediesels!",
  "str_voice_1500751_26": "Okay, all of the installations are working. Go fetch me some high-calorie foods to replenish my energy.",
  "str_voice_1500751_27": "Bugs are the worst, and if you throw in missing glasses... I'll just explode.",
  "str_voice_1500751_28": "Huh, this Colossus of yours isn't junk at all... Everything's intact inside and it's fully functional! It has caught my eyes!",
  "str_voice_1500751_29": "Just flaunt my name, Odi, from now on when someone decides to mess with your comm system. It'll scare the pants off them!",
  "str_voice_1500751_3": "What's wrong with being short? Getting a little ballsy, are we? Ever seen tall but braindead morons before? Any Rediesel base is full of them!",

  "str_voice_1500751_35": "Tell me, who's getting it this time?",
  "str_voice_1500751_36": "So what? Just mess them up.",
  "str_voice_1500751_37": "Oops, the cable's going haywire again!",
  "str_voice_1500751_38": "I can't get it to work! Huh? Did they just keel over themselves?",
  "str_voice_1500751_39": "Freeze!",
  "str_voice_1500751_4": "My cable has its own power source. Check out the torque, it's folds better than the Sand Kraken out there.",

  "str_voice_1500751_45": "I can tell you're not good at picking out a gift.",

  "str_voice_1500761_1": "There's no human that's extra special as all of them have a past and carry secrets. I love how everyone is the same. As for the Aurorian... What is it?",

  "str_voice_1500761_18": "All the sporadic lights are about to disappear. What about you? Do you want to still stay here with me?",
  "str_voice_1500761_19": "You are still here at this hour! Do you want to go to the deep sea with me? I know now...",
  "str_voice_1500761_2": "There isn't much difference between the lie and the truth. There isn't even a boundary. When I say \"this sentence is a lie\", it's meaningless whether it's true or false.",

  "str_voice_1500761_8": "I'm always able to hide the truth in lies, and I always hope that the person listening to me can tell what I'm really thinking. Do you believe me? I mean, you do look quite naive.",

  "str_voice_1500781_1": "Please... keep your distance from me... That would be better because I'm afraid I'll knock you out by accident... Sorry.",
  "str_voice_1500781_10": "...you hardly get to rest... I won't let anyone disturb you... unless it's Dayna.",
  "str_voice_1500781_11": "So you want me to watch over it? I get it. Relax, I've done this before.",

  "str_voice_1500781_24": "Dayna is like family to me... I don't actually call her my sister, but... she's more important to me than a sister.",
  "str_voice_1500781_25": "I am grateful to Miss Sheol for taking care of me, but I hope she won't get that close to me next time... It feels a little suffocating.",
  "str_voice_1500781_26": "...Things I like... Well, can I... can I say I like Dayna?",
  "str_voice_1500781_27": "I dislike anything that suddenly comes close to me... and I hate the Eclipsites.",

  "str_voice_1500781_33": "I don't care if I'm covered in mud... as long as I gain more power.",
  "str_voice_1500781_34": "Gotta bring the tube.",
  "str_voice_1500781_35": "Measuring done.",
  "str_voice_1500781_36": "I can wait a little longer.",
  "str_voice_1500781_37": "I can't stop... even if you beg for mercy.",

  "str_voice_1500781_45": "Is it really okay to accept this gift...",
  "str_voice_1500781_46": "What!? It's... You know what I like?",
  "str_voice_1500781_47": "I'll quietly take it, quietly.",
  "str_voice_1500781_48": "This is... Thank you, I mean it.",
  "str_voice_1500781_49": "During those years... Maybe it was because things were so difficult that people became so indifferent, fighting with and trampling over one another.",
  "str_voice_1500781_5": "I'm no longer the weak and powerless child I used to be. Now I'm... you better keep your distance from me... Don't get too close.",
  "str_voice_1500781_50": "Hunger and discrimination won't disappear with naive trust. All of us know this, and only by relying on our own strength can we survive...",
  "str_voice_1500781_51": "She has assumed the burden of my hatred... But I must resolve this myself. I can't let her get involved in this... Dayna and hatred don't go well together.",
  "str_voice_1500781_52": "...Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1500781_53": "Ahem, what's that...",
  "str_voice_1500781_54": "Good morning...",
  "str_voice_1500781_55": "Ahem, what a coincidence...",
  "str_voice_1500781_56": "You're still up?",
  "str_voice_1500781_57": "Happy New Year, do you want to celebrate?",
  "str_voice_1500781_6": "I... I know that I'll have to rely on my own strength to resolve my hatred one day... or maybe now.",
  "str_voice_1500781_7": "Sorry, I thought you were as rude as the people outside... but actually, you're much better than them... At least you know how to keep our distance.",
  "str_voice_1500781_8": "Well... I think you're a very powerful person and I know you'll become even more powerful. So... Do you want to visit Dayna and learn from her?",
  "str_voice_1500781_9": "We're similar in many ways... I think Dayna will agree with that. So, well... have you considered coming to Umbraton?",
  "str_voice_1500841_1": "I'll tell you a joke about atonement. When you want a scapegoat to be pushed down a cliff or exiled into the wilderness, it doesn't matter whether it is innocent or not: it just needs to have horns.",
  "str_voice_1500841_10": "Don't be so stubborn. No, I mean... you should visit me when you're not busy. We can play chess and I have tales for you.",
  "str_voice_1500841_11": "I'm used to living in the shadows... Fine, I guess that isn't necessary anymore... Do I just sit here?",
  "str_voice_1500841_12": "Every move should be made with perfection in mind, so you must think carefully before you act.",

  "str_voice_1500841_16": "Welcome back. Since fate has given you this responsibility, I believe you are prepared to take action.",
  "str_voice_1500841_17": "Very good. You've come at just the right time, just like how shadows always arrive first.",
  "str_voice_1500841_18": "If you're tired, sit down and rest for a while before we start.",
  "str_voice_1500841_19": "The youngsters of today seem to have a habit of being active at this hour... Hmm... They hide in the darkness.",
  "str_voice_1500841_2": "It's thanks to his wife that Schwartz has his current success... Huh... It seems that he has one foot in the coffin, but he's actually not that old.",
  "str_voice_1500841_20": "As we all know, Umbraton is responsible for maintaining half of the order of Lumopolis.",
  "str_voice_1500841_21": "Tell the fellows from Illumina to stop wasting their time on putting the cart before the horse.",
  "str_voice_1500841_22": "The shadow is watching you.",
  "str_voice_1500841_23": "They are creatures that don't know the truth, so you don't need to show mercy when fighting for survival.",
  "str_voice_1500841_24": "That old-looking guy always does annoying things at peculiar moments, like cheating when playing chess.",
  "str_voice_1500841_25": "That hot-blooded man should know that he needs to be able to call the shots before he can change the situation.",
  "str_voice_1500841_26": "I have some storage cabinets full of many masterpieces in my room.",
  "str_voice_1500841_27": "The untrustworthy, the unrighteous, and the rude. Fellas of these sorts don't deserve to exist.",
  "str_voice_1500841_28": "I've heard that the Colossus is a form of shelter as well as proof of a certain mission.",
  "str_voice_1500841_29": "Put away your curiosity. All you need to know is that I am a ghost of the past that continues to haunt Umbraton, and the last person the people of Lumopolis want to face.",
  "str_voice_1500841_3": "The first demon was born with a staff that could incinerate demons into ashes, so it's a matter of fact that he should guard the gates of hell.",
  "str_voice_1500841_30": "The stronger I get, the more boring things become.",
  "str_voice_1500841_31": "For the shadows, this is a deeper level.",

  "str_voice_1500841_33": "I shall become the shadow...",
  "str_voice_1500841_34": "Let's work together.",
  "str_voice_1500841_35": "So what if there's a price to pay?",

  "str_voice_1500841_4": "This old throne is not something to be seized, but a symbol of respect. It will become something new after it is tempered by fire.",
  "str_voice_1500841_40": "Cower before me!",
  "str_voice_1500841_41": "Sure, I'll take the command.",
  "str_voice_1500841_42": "Victory belongs to everyone.",
  "str_voice_1500841_43": "Defeat is of no value, unlike self-reflection.",
  "str_voice_1500841_44": "Very good! Many people can live here with new identities.",
  "str_voice_1500841_45": "Don't bother because you won't be getting anything back from me.",
  "str_voice_1500841_46": "Yes, I can sense how valuable this is.",
  "str_voice_1500841_47": "Although it isn't necessary, I'll consider giving you something in return.",
  "str_voice_1500841_48": "Haha! I'll keep this safe in my storage cabinet.",
  "str_voice_1500841_49": "The shadows of chaos never reflect anything. They simply extend their web throughout Umbraton like spider webs to maintain the unique order of Umbraton.",
  "str_voice_1500841_5": "Those who scheme all day won't dare to act recklessly, and those who oppress and exploit those beneath them won't be without a bottom line. That's because they know the shadows are watching them.",
  "str_voice_1500841_50": "Before Lumopolis became divided, the darkness had a strong hold over the city. People turned a blind eye to everything that didn't concern them.",
  "str_voice_1500841_51": "Ensuring a source of funds, helping and adopting poor children and orphans, and teaching them to fight their destiny—this is the way to cultivate a new order in the shadows.",

  "str_voice_1500841_57": "Go celebrate the New Year.",
  "str_voice_1500841_6": "When I returned to this place, the legend of Umbraton became a real description of sorts. The leader and shadows began to take control of every inch of this land.",
  "str_voice_1500841_7": "The justice I defend is not the same as what comes out of your mouth. It may be chaotic, but it could not be distorted. You aren't capable of understanding it yet.",
  "str_voice_1500841_8": "You grew up without the protection of your parents, just like I did. But one day, you'll find being down in the mud unbearable.",
  "str_voice_1500841_9": "You can do much better as a Navigator, but learning from experience and the risk of crashing often come hand in hand... Follow me; it'll be much easier for you.",
  "str_voice_1500871_1": "As a noble of Lumopolis, I must protect people like you... Don't you need my protection? I underestimated you.",
  "str_voice_1500871_10": "Is it break time? As an excellent warrior of Lumopolis, having too much free time doesn't seem proper. However, I am indeed in need of some rest.",
  "str_voice_1500871_11": "If I must do it, I shall shoulder the responsibility. You just have to trust me.",
  "str_voice_1500871_12": "I might have cared too much about my status. But people are born unequal.",
  "str_voice_1500871_13": "All those common people lacking sound judgment should just sit and wait to be protected, shouldn't they?",

  "str_voice_1500871_16": "There you are. It's my daily training time. I mean... I'm practicing darts now.",
  "str_voice_1500871_17": "There's no need for greetings. It's unnecessary to waste time on that.",

  "str_voice_1500871_25": "Ms. Carleen is the City Lord's child, but she's a little too naive.",
  "str_voice_1500871_26": "To be exact, opera is not a hobby because it's now part of my life.",
  "str_voice_1500871_27": "Those nobles that hide behind their titles and live wasteful lives are nothing but self-aggrandizing fools.",
  "str_voice_1500871_28": "The Colossus symbolizes your lineage and identity, as well as your pride and glory in the future.",
  "str_voice_1500871_29": "Nice to meet you. My name is Beverly. I will be working with you this time. As a member of the Lumopolis Guard, it is my responsibility to protect the common people here. Rest assured.",
  "str_voice_1500871_3": "Is my hobby old-fashioned? There's nothing wrong with having a thing for traditional opera the way I see it. As a noble, I should take cultural heritage seriously.",

  "str_voice_1500924_36": "What do you think?",
  "str_voice_1500924_37": "Taste my beautiful thorns!",
  "str_voice_1500924_38": "Don't struggle. It'll hurt even more.",
  "str_voice_1500924_39": "Take it all!",
  "str_voice_1500924_40": "You can't escape!",
  "str_voice_1500924_44": "I've been liking it here recently. That is exactly what Hunting Stone's been thinking, not me!",
  "str_voice_1500924_58": "From now on, I'll live an honorable life with Hunting Stone!",
  "str_voice_1500924_59": "If you have some time, could you accompany me to Umbraton again?",
  "str_voice_1500924_60": "Is there anything you'd like me to do for you? I hate owing such big favors.",
  "str_voice_1500924_61": "I'll try to consider your opinions, but eating carrots is non-negotiable.",
  "str_voice_1500924_62": "This attire perfectly suits what my father wanted for me, but now I wear it for myself.",
  "str_voice_1500924_63": "Was this town truly undiscovered before? Indeed, it seems it's up to me to take the reins.",
  "str_voice_1500924_64": "As long as no one is looking, perhaps... tasting a pebble off the ground wouldn't be out of the question?",
  "str_voice_1500924_65": "Resorting to blows without a word... Utterly nonsensical. Now I just feel sad about my new dress.",
  "str_voice_1500924_66": "If not for that peculiar scent, this forest would surely be delectable.",
  "str_voice_1500924_67": "Hunting Stone, this time, it's my turn to chase your trail!",
  "str_voice_1500924_68": "Hmm? Shall I teach you how to follow the rules?",
  "str_voice_1500924_69": "Now is not the time to rest!",

  "str_voice_1500924_71": "Treasure discovered!",
  "str_voice_1500971_1": "Save patients? That was a long time ago... Plus, some things are not worth saving.",
  "str_voice_1500971_10": "Wanna learn something new since you're just sitting around? Do you want to know where the thirteenth vertebra is?",
  "str_voice_1500971_11": "Need my help? Sure. But for the record, I'm only doing this for the Shadowlord.",
  "str_voice_1500971_12": "Cardiac surgery? It isn't that easy to bring someone back from the dead.",
  "str_voice_1500971_13": "Saving people is not in conflict with killing people. They are just different forms of practicing one's belief.",
  "str_voice_1500971_14": "Slice from the best angle... Oh, don't worry about it. The aorta is so fragile that you can slice it any way you like.",
  "str_voice_1500971_15": "Happy birthday, Navigator. Have you made your birthday wishes?",
  "str_voice_1500971_16": "You look rested. Remember to wash your hands often to prevent from falling sick.",
  "str_voice_1500971_17": "Getting up early in the morning is good for health. I assume it's the same for Caelestites.",
  "str_voice_1500971_18": "It's dinner time. Don't work on an empty stomach. It can be harmful.",
  "str_voice_1500971_19": "Are you still working? Staying up late increases the risk of dying from myocardial infarction. Get some rest now.",
  "str_voice_1500971_2": "It's a lancet made of ice and snow, so it's not going to cause that much pain when it's stabbed into your body. Would you like to give it a try?",
  "str_voice_1500971_20": "Umbraton is filled with vitality and madness, that's why it needs special surgery.",
  "str_voice_1500971_21": "It's probably not bad practicing medicine in Lumopolis. It could be a little boring, though.",
  "str_voice_1500971_22": "The shadow is watching you.",
  "str_voice_1500971_23": "I used to believe everything can be saved, other than the Eclipsites.",

  "str_voice_1500971_25": "The Shadowlord showed me a new way to live my life and brought me new patients.",
  "str_voice_1500971_26": "The fire in the fireplace. It always calms me down. It's a solace to see a fire like this during long nights.",
  "str_voice_1500971_27": "Wounds, suppuration, bleeding. You might as well cauterize it if you can't treat it properly.",
  "str_voice_1500971_28": "There seems to be a lot of old wounds on your Colossus. When are you going to clean them? I can help.",
  "str_voice_1500971_29": "Why did you ask for me? I was indeed a doctor who can perform surgeries but I've changed my profession... I'm an assassin now.",
  "str_voice_1500971_3": "What quests have I completed? Many. If you want to know, I can test things out on you.",
  "str_voice_1500971_30": "I should probably cut something.",
  "str_voice_1500971_31": "My surgery skills need further improvement.",
  "str_voice_1500971_32": "This lancet is sharper than before.",
  "str_voice_1500971_33": "I have never forgotten a doctor's duties.",
  "str_voice_1500971_34": "Which one is the patient?",
  "str_voice_1500971_35": "Prepare for the surgery.",
  "str_voice_1500971_36": "Please relax, my patients.",
  "str_voice_1500971_37": "Let the pills work their charm!",
  "str_voice_1500971_38": "Be purged of this chronic disease!",
  "str_voice_1500971_39": "Freeze, ice blade.",
  "str_voice_1500971_4": "The key point of surgery? I would say precise excision.",
  "str_voice_1500971_40": "Where should I cut next?",
  "str_voice_1500971_41": "Fine, I'll be the main surgeon this time.",
  "str_voice_1500971_42": "The surgery went well.",
  "str_voice_1500971_43": "It takes time to treat chronic diseases. This is not the right time to cure it.",
  "str_voice_1500971_44": "What am I looking at? Your heart, of course.",
  "str_voice_1500971_45": "Right. Thanks.",
  "str_voice_1500971_46": "Hmm? Thanks a lot.",
  "str_voice_1500971_47": "Looks nice. I'll take it.",
  "str_voice_1500971_48": "Thank you. I'll cherish it.",
  "str_voice_1500971_49": "Wounds left by Eclipsites are tricky to treat sometimes. It took me a lot of effort dealing with them during the days of my medical studies in Lumopolis. Fortunately, I did well on it.",
  "str_voice_1500971_5": "I'll probably go back to being a doctor after the darkness in Umbraton recedes. Before that, I must perform another surgery, a surgery for Umbraton.",
  "str_voice_1500971_50": "I saved a lot of people with my lancet but not my parents. It didn't work for Eclipsites, so I used another knife.",
  "str_voice_1500971_51": "The chronic disease of Umbraton can't be cured with ordinary methods. It requires a lot of removals and patching-ups while waiting for new hopes to sprout. Before then, I'll continue to pull my weight.",
  "str_voice_1500971_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1500971_53": "Hey.",
  "str_voice_1500971_54": "Morning.",
  "str_voice_1500971_55": "Hey, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1500971_56": "Good evening. You're still up?",
  "str_voice_1500971_57": "Happy New Year, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1500971_6": "I once wished to save more people with my lancet. Now, I wish I could become the lancet of Umbraton and remove its necrotic parts.",
  "str_voice_1500971_7": "Caelestite? Interesting. May I study your body? I want to know if Caelestites have the same fatal parts as normal Aurorians... Ha-ha, just kidding.",
  "str_voice_1500971_8": "You can come to me if you need surgery. I've stopped practicing medicine but my skills are more honed than before. Why? It's a secret.",
  "str_voice_1500971_9": "The more patients I see, the more I realize how fragile life is. Therefore, I have a better understanding of how to cure them or send them away.",
  "str_voice_1500981_1": "I didn't mean to add chili to the cake. I thought the chili was some kind of long cherry.",
  "str_voice_1500981_10": "It is so quiet... Like I'm secluded...",
  "str_voice_1500981_11": "Just do what you usually do.",
  "str_voice_1500981_12": "How I want to look at those flowers blooming from the dead bodies a few more times... But Istvan doesn't allow me to do it at will.",
  "str_voice_1500981_13": "Don't worry. I don't have any health problems. I never do.",
  "str_voice_1500981_14": "Caelestites... I think I have some memories of them... They're buried somewhere deep in my brain, so deep that I can't reach them.",
  "str_voice_1500981_15": "Happy birthday! May all your days be filled with joy.",
  "str_voice_1500981_16": "Be sure to take advantage of the best time of the day...",
  "str_voice_1500981_17": "Good morning. Keep up the good work today.",
  "str_voice_1500981_18": "You're back. Did you forget something?",
  "str_voice_1500981_19": "I don't need to sleep. Don't worry.",
  "str_voice_1500981_2": "Those black flowers... They're so pretty.",
  "str_voice_1500981_20": "Umbraton... It's dangerous but it makes me feel at ease. I think it's perfect for me.",
  "str_voice_1500981_21": "I see people from Illumina occasionally. They seemed... friendly.",
  "str_voice_1500981_22": "Istvan has been watching you...",
  "str_voice_1500981_23": "Horrible creatures... Most importantly... They are without emotions...",
  "str_voice_1500981_24": "Istvan is very empathic. That's why he has so many followers.",
  "str_voice_1500981_25": "It... It seems that Kleken doesn't like to chat with me.",
  "str_voice_1500981_26": "The flowers blooming from the dead bodies appeal to me but I'm not sure if this is the emotion people experience when they like something.",
  "str_voice_1500981_27": "I don't loathe anything. Nothing makes much of a difference to me...",
  "str_voice_1500981_28": "Colossus... I rather miss this word. It'd be so nice if I could talk to them...",
  "str_voice_1500981_29": "Nice to meet you... My name is Cuscuta. I'm from Umbraton... Is this too formal?",
  "str_voice_1500981_3": "I don't understand what you're saying, but... You seem happy. Maybe I should laugh with you.",
  "str_voice_1500981_30": "The curse is getting stronger...",
  "str_voice_1500981_31": "I can hold on...",
  "str_voice_1500981_32": "The energy of the curse is about to overflow.",
  "str_voice_1500981_33": "This body is falling asleep.",
  "str_voice_1500981_34": "I'm here.",
  "str_voice_1500981_35": "There are sufficient nutrients.",
  "str_voice_1500981_36": "I'm ready when you are.",
  "str_voice_1500981_37": "This will reduce your distress.",
  "str_voice_1500981_38": "May beautiful flowers bloom out of you.",
  "str_voice_1500981_39": "Return to dust...",
  "str_voice_1500981_4": "I remember neither who I am, nor why I'm here. The only thing I know is that my mission is to seal that tree.",
  "str_voice_1500981_40": "Sleep in peace.",
  "str_voice_1500981_41": "I'll give it a go.",
  "str_voice_1500981_42": "There'll eventually be a sea of flowers here.",
  "str_voice_1500981_43": "I need a new body.",
  "str_voice_1500981_44": "I'm taking a tour of your Colossus. Is there something I can do for you?",
  "str_voice_1500981_45": "Thanks for the gift.",
  "str_voice_1500981_46": "It looks kind of special.",
  "str_voice_1500981_47": "Is this what you call... a token of your regard?",
  "str_voice_1500981_48": "It warms my heart...",
  "str_voice_1500981_49": "I don't remember how many times I've woken up. That must be why I've lost so many memories and emotions. That proves that I've died many times.",
  "str_voice_1500981_5": "The cursed fragrance corrupts all visitors' minds, spiraling them into obsessed beings, who eventually become our nutrients.",
  "str_voice_1500981_50": "I can get rid of people soundlessly. That's why Istvan put me in charge of executing people. I accepted because the flowers blooming out of the bodies are beautiful.",
  "str_voice_1500981_51": "I tried chatting about other things with people, but it's simply too hard. I didn't even know what to say.",
  "str_voice_1500981_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1500981_53": "Hello.",
  "str_voice_1500981_54": "Good morning. A new day has begun.",
  "str_voice_1500981_55": "Good afternoon. Are you on a break?",
  "str_voice_1500981_56": "Sweet dreams.",
  "str_voice_1500981_57": "Happy New Year. I hope you'll get a fresh start with the coming of the new year.",
  "str_voice_1500981_6": "Those agitated spirits hover on the fringe of the cursed tree, murmuring words we can't understand, attempting to strip me of my senses.",
  "str_voice_1500981_7": "You are rather different from the others. I haven't felt like this for a long time.",
  "str_voice_1500981_8": "Some things triggered my memories, but none of the stories had a happy ending, for not even I could understand my past self.",
  "str_voice_1500981_9": "I hope you're the first thing I see every time I wake up as a new me.",
  "str_voice_1500991_1": "I'm lucky even though I was born with a curse. Because of the curse, I'm born to be able to walk on thorns... Um, my power is kind of related to thorns, you know.",
  "str_voice_1500991_10": "13, 14, 15... Oh, I'm counting the thorns on my body. Sometimes I do this to kill time and to examine my thorns.",
  "str_voice_1500991_11": "Leave it to me. I can do anything... Eh? All I need to do is to stay here?... This is way easier than my usual job.",
  "str_voice_1500991_12": "I must cherish my cloth. After all, this is the last one... Ugh, when was it cut here?",
  "str_voice_1500991_13": "Because of the curse, black thorns grow on me. I wish they could stop growing.",
  "str_voice_1500991_14": "The black thorns on this magic sword can be broken off and new ones would grow out. Isn't that incredible?",
  "str_voice_1500991_15": "I don't know how to celebrate people's birthdays. Do I... sing and clap?",
  "str_voice_1500991_16": "It's time to work. Whom to take down? Is it too scary a subject to talk about?",
  "str_voice_1500991_17": "Good morning. I'm quite healthy today and I can work energetically. How about you?",
  "str_voice_1500991_18": "Don't be too concerned about work. Get some rest. Maybe everything will get better then.",
  "str_voice_1500991_19": "It's going to get chilly at night, be careful not to catch cold... Oh, I'll be fine. I'm used to it.",
  "str_voice_1500991_2": "I don't find this magic sword heavy. I've got the black thorns to share my load... Eh? How? Well, um... I don't know how to explain this to you.",
  "str_voice_1500991_20": "Umbraton is nice. It allows me to earn my living as a mercenary.",
  "str_voice_1500991_21": "There may be more intel at the True Order but I find it fishy somehow...",
  "str_voice_1500991_22": "As if you're being watched or something?",
  "str_voice_1500991_23": "Eclipsites have killed many people. I hope none of you, including my parents, will run into them.",
  "str_voice_1500991_24": "Ms. Connolly told me I'm welcome to get a coffee in her café. She said that to someone like me...",
  "str_voice_1500991_25": "Ms. Jane refers jobs to me. She also taught me how to read mercenary contracts. I'm very grateful to her.",
  "str_voice_1500991_26": "Actually... I like small animals a lot but I'm afraid I might injure them accidentally.",
  "str_voice_1500991_27": "I hate my cursed body, but I can't bring myself to hate this magic sword...",
  "str_voice_1500991_28": "Your relationship with the Colossus is kind of like mine with the magic sword, connected and symbiotic.",
  "str_voice_1500991_29": "Would you like to hire me? I can help with fighting and I don't ask to be highly paid... I can get rid of anything for you within reach of this magic sword.",
  "str_voice_1500991_3": "The magic sword is named after the moon. It has profound power and I cannot separate myself from it, so that probably makes me profound too...",
  "str_voice_1500991_30": "The power of the curse is getting stronger...",
  "str_voice_1500991_31": "I understand. I should raise the sword.",
  "str_voice_1500991_32": "Someday, all will end.",
  "str_voice_1500991_33": "It's fine even if the path is filled with thorns.",
  "str_voice_1500991_34": "Remember to... keep your distance.",
  "str_voice_1500991_35": "I'm ready.",
  "str_voice_1500991_36": "I'll follow your lead.",
  "str_voice_1500991_37": "Borrow me your powers, magic sword.",
  "str_voice_1500991_38": "Cut through the thorns to open a path forward!",
  "str_voice_1500991_39": "Take the thorns.",
  "str_voice_1500991_4": "It's okay. I'll find a way to undo the curse before its powers destroy me.",
  "str_voice_1500991_40": "Let there be light.",
  "str_voice_1500991_41": "What?... You want me to lead?",
  "str_voice_1500991_42": "Great. We won this time.",
  "str_voice_1500991_43": "I was hardly coping... Sorry...",
  "str_voice_1500991_44": "To me, besides wielding my sword, other activities... Oh, I'm fine with chatting, I guess.",
  "str_voice_1500991_45": "Well... This does not count as my pay, does it?",
  "str_voice_1500991_46": "This is a gift for me?... Are you sure I can take it?",
  "str_voice_1500991_47": "Um... Please let me think about how to thank you...",
  "str_voice_1500991_48": "Thank! What a precious gift, I'm so happy.",
  "str_voice_1500991_49": "Maybe some people had the same symptoms as I do a long time ago. That's probably why the ancient books and this sword have been passed on.",
  "str_voice_1500991_5": "The thorns are there to protect themselves. Is it the same for this thorn-covered magic sword? Why did it come with the curse and why did it... give me powers?",
  "str_voice_1500991_50": "Cute little animals used to come to my room and play with me when I was bedridden. But they never came after I got the magic sword.",
  "str_voice_1500991_51": "I know my parents can't be with me anymore because of the curse... But we're all looking for ways to solve it. Someday, we'll meet again.",
  "str_voice_1500991_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1500991_53": "Greetings.",
  "str_voice_1500991_54": "Um, are you awake?",
  "str_voice_1500991_55": "Do you have a minute?",
  "str_voice_1500991_56": "Am I disturbing your rest?",
  "str_voice_1500991_57": "I wish you all the best this year.",
  "str_voice_1500991_6": "For what do I fight? For what am I persevering? For what did I start my journey? I ask myself these questions again and again. But the answer is simple. I just want to keep living...",
  "str_voice_1500991_7": "Please don't touch the magic sword. I don't want you to possibly get into any trouble. Just stay away from it. I don't want you to get hurt.",
  "str_voice_1500991_8": "I do the best I can to work alone, but it's not bad to form bonds with others like this...",
  "str_voice_1500991_9": "I don't dare to be near you because I cherish you. I hope you can understand... I'm right here though, somewhere not too far from you.",
  "str_voice_1500994_1": "Navigator... Oh, should I address you as \"Young Master\" in this outfit?",
  "str_voice_1500994_10": "No stain on the sleeves... and the hem isn't ripped. This is great.",
  "str_voice_1500994_11": "Areia the Mercenary now watches over Twin Pavilions Bay. This outfit I'm in... should let me be a match for you.",
  "str_voice_1500994_12": "They say silk is breathable. I had no idea what that meant until I got to wear a garment made from it.",
  "str_voice_1500994_13": "The Magic Sword has always protected me, that I know. I just didn't expect this kind of bond.",
  "str_voice_1500994_14": "Given a more suitable outfit and a deeper understanding of the Magic Sword, I'm better equipped to assist you in battle. Thank you in advance for your patience.",
  "str_voice_1500994_16": "... My job for today? It is to serve by your side. Is there anything I can do for you?",
  "str_voice_1500994_17": "Good morning. It's a dream for me to feel the sun's rays on my bare skin.",
  "str_voice_1500994_18": "Your work has finished? Where will you go to rest, then? I will keep watch over you.",
  "str_voice_1500994_19": "Windproof cloaks sold in Twin Pavilions Bay are light and insulated. I've been saving up to buy one for you...",
  "str_voice_1500994_2": "Longzhou hairpins are piercingly sharp, yet a symbol of charm when adorning the hair.",
  "str_voice_1500994_3": "Swords are mere weapons; their purpose is shaped by those who wield them. My magic sword is brandished to protect the town, and to protect you.",
  "str_voice_1500994_35": "The Magic Sword is vibrating.",
  "str_voice_1500994_36": "The sword dances for you.",
  "str_voice_1500994_37": "Focus all energy, Magic Sword!",
  "str_voice_1500994_38": "Help me conquer, Magic sword!",
  "str_voice_1500994_39": "Strike!",
  "str_voice_1500994_40": "Thorn strike!",
  "str_voice_1500994_44": "I practiced conversation skills in Twin Pavilions Bay, but I have no idea whether I've improved...",
  "str_voice_1500994_58": "The Magic Sword protected me, and I'll use it to protect other people.",
  "str_voice_1500994_59": "I never thought flowers on thorns would be as pretty as wisteria.",
  "str_voice_1500994_60": "Longzhou people say big swords usually don't boast sharpness, but the Magic Sword is both sharp and thorned.",
  "str_voice_1500994_61": "That young healer's prescription was effective. Despite not breaking the curse, I'm still very grateful.",
  "str_voice_1500994_62": "I will never forget my forefathers' intentions when they forged the sword...",
  "str_voice_1500994_63": "I can scale walls, brandish a sword, and move with ease in this outfit... and it's very pretty.",
  "str_voice_1500994_64": "Should I learn to sew and tailor a fitting outfit for you?",
  "str_voice_1500994_65": "Hm, does everyone think I'm a cloak fanatic?",
  "str_voice_1500994_66": "It's okay, even if the curse can't be broken... I'll still do my best to survive!",
  "str_voice_1500994_67": "There are many people I want to repay, such as Miss Xuan Ji, Miss Dantang, and you...",
  "str_voice_1500994_68": "Yes. From now on, I'll be the Magic Swordswoman, and your Areia as well.",
  "str_voice_1500994_69": "I've arrived at the location for my new mission. Now, I need to confirm the target.",
  "str_voice_1500994_70": "What is it you want to tell me, Magic Sword?",
  "str_voice_1500994_71": "I will not let down the Magic Sword!",
  "str_voice_1500994_72": "What local specialty should I bring for my friends in Umbraton and on the Colossus?",
  "str_voice_1500994_73": "This outfit is so light! I want to move around in it some more.",
  "str_voice_1500994_74": "Do you feel malice in our surroundings too, Magic Sword?",
  "str_voice_1500994_75": "Hey! Hah!",
  "str_voice_1500994_76": "I sense something!",
  "str_voice_1501001_1": "I stayed here only because I want to. It has nothing to do with you, Snowball.",
  "str_voice_1501001_10": "Have you got nothing to do, Snowball? Wanna swap places? Come sit here.",
  "str_voice_1501001_11": "Can't you perform your duties properly, Snowball? Fine, I'll help you.",
  "str_voice_1501001_12": "So what if they knew about my past? All they can do is sigh.",
  "str_voice_1501001_13": "I hope you won't always ask questions like those blockheads.",
  "str_voice_1501001_14": "Please don't put me with anyone. I like peace and quiet... Though I didn't say you should leave.",
  "str_voice_1501001_15": "Birthday... It's been a long time since I last heard of this word. Well then... Happy birthday, Snowball.",
  "str_voice_1501001_16": "Stop greeting me all the time. Go do what you should do, Snowball.",
  "str_voice_1501001_17": "It's always so quiet in the morning, but it'll become really noisy once those blockheads wake up.",
  "str_voice_1501001_18": "Enjoy the dazzling noon sunlight by yourself, Snowball. I'm going to rest now.",
  "str_voice_1501001_19": "I want to enjoy this peaceful night, Snowball. Don't let any paramecia bother me.",
  "str_voice_1501001_2": "You're different from those paramecia, Snowball. That's probably why you can pilot the Colossus.",
  "str_voice_1501001_20": "Those people look odd, but fortunately they don't bother me.",
  "str_voice_1501001_21": "Don't worry. I won't force them to think with their brains that are the size of a paramecium.",
  "str_voice_1501001_22": "Well, may the Truth bless you.",
  "str_voice_1501001_23": "Pathetic creatures that can't hold a candle even to paramecia.",
  "str_voice_1501001_24": "Lady Victoria is strong, but she is still far from being capable enough to peek into the secret of the Catacomb.",
  "str_voice_1501001_25": "Pact is as stubborn as her inflexible ring. I'm unlike her in this regard.",
  "str_voice_1501001_26": "Tranquil nights. It would be perfect if there is a slight breeze.",
  "str_voice_1501001_27": "There are too many noisy paramecia on this continent.",
  "str_voice_1501001_28": "It's such a big fellow, but it's so quiet when it flies. It is indeed a creation from ancient civilization.",
  "str_voice_1501001_29": "I am Sikare, Keeper of the Crypt. Why do you look shocked? I hope the title didn't frighten you.",
  "str_voice_1501001_3": "Sometimes it serves no purpose to try to talk sense into those blockheads. Just give them orders.",
  "str_voice_1501001_30": "This is my true power.",
  "str_voice_1501001_31": "Faria is awoken.",
  "str_voice_1501001_32": "I have secured the power of the Catacomb.",
  "str_voice_1501001_33": "Maybe... I'll be able to break free from the crypt.",
  "str_voice_1501001_34": "All I need is myself.",
  "str_voice_1501001_35": "Show yourself.",
  "str_voice_1501001_36": "Faria, be prepared.",
  "str_voice_1501001_37": "Faria, open!",
  "str_voice_1501001_38": "Faria, release!",
  "str_voice_1501001_39": "The breath of death.",
  "str_voice_1501001_4": "I'll never need the help of those paramecia no matter how difficult it gets.",
  "str_voice_1501001_40": "Goodbye, paramecia.",
  "str_voice_1501001_41": "I'm not used to operating with others.",
  "str_voice_1501001_42": "Is that the best you can do?",
  "str_voice_1501001_43": "I'll hold them off.",
  "str_voice_1501001_44": "Do you want to see the real catacomb, Snowball?",
  "str_voice_1501001_45": "This doesn't catch my eye, Snowball.",
  "str_voice_1501001_46": "Mmm, this is more like it.",
  "str_voice_1501001_47": "The Dantes family will remember your gift, Snowball.",
  "str_voice_1501001_48": "You... Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1501001_49": "The Dantes family is not a subordinate of the True Order. Instead, they are allies. You must be able to tell the difference.",
  "str_voice_1501001_5": "Can you smell the danger now? You'll have to be careful when you approach me from now on.",
  "str_voice_1501001_50": "Faria... It's the key to the Starry Crypt, and the Grave Keeper is the only one who can control it. You don't need to know much about this. I'll explain to you when I think it's necessary.",
  "str_voice_1501001_51": "Since I was born, my mission has been to guard this catacomb until I die, or... am reborn.",
  "str_voice_1501001_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1501001_53": "Hello, Snowball.",
  "str_voice_1501001_54": "Good morning, Snowball.",
  "str_voice_1501001_55": "Oh, good afternoon...",
  "str_voice_1501001_56": "It's getting late. Good night, Snowball.",
  "str_voice_1501001_57": "Happy New Year.",
  "str_voice_1501001_6": "Are you surprised, Snowball? This is my real power, but I don't care about it at all.",
  "str_voice_1501001_7": "The Dantes family has been responsible for guarding the Starry Crypt since ancient times. I have no choice but to inherit the mission.",
  "str_voice_1501001_8": "My power comes from my family, but what I am experiencing now... will become a valuable strength that belongs only to me.",
  "str_voice_1501001_9": "Many say that I married the Catacomb, but one day I will leave it with my own strength after my mission is completed.",
  "str_voice_1501041_1": "Compared to eternity, the blooming of a flower is only but a moment in time.",
  "str_voice_1501041_10": "You stopped? I may not be able to see, but I can sense it.",
  "str_voice_1501041_11": "You can count on me, but could you please water Eve's flowers for me?",
  "str_voice_1501041_12": "Yes? I was just getting more familiar with this room's layout.",
  "str_voice_1501041_13": "The air in this Colossus is different... Maybe this is what the sky smells like?",
  "str_voice_1501041_14": "Are you there? No wonder it got so lively all of a sudden.",
  "str_voice_1501041_15": "I made this wreath just for you. Happy birthday.",
  "str_voice_1501041_16": "Do you have any plans for today? No? Then why don't we take a walk, and maybe bathe in the sun for a bit?",
  "str_voice_1501041_17": "Good morning? At dawn's first light, the rising sun scatters the darkness of night. Beautiful, huh?",
  "str_voice_1501041_18": "It's cold out tonight. Try not to catch a cold.",
  "str_voice_1501041_19": "You're not planning on staying up all night, are you? Why would you do that to yourself?",
  "str_voice_1501041_2": "Do you enjoy sitting in the sun? It's been ages since I've done it... The sun feels magical on my skin... Although it can startle me sometimes, the warmth can feel nice.",
  "str_voice_1501041_20": "Eve's home is my home, and her family... is my family.",
  "str_voice_1501041_21": "Illumina... I have nothing but sad memories of that place.",
  "str_voice_1501041_22": "\"Live life to the fullest!\" You can't go a single day without someone in the Rediesel Wrench hollering that at the top of their lungs.",
  "str_voice_1501041_23": "I used to dominate the Eclipsites of Red-eye Gorge for a time. Pretty impressive, huh?",
  "str_voice_1501041_24": "I swear I'll always face the sun, no matter how hot it gets.",
  "str_voice_1501041_25": "I can't believe Sinsa is actually Eve's older brother... They look nothing alike!",
  "str_voice_1501041_26": "Eve likes flowers. I like them, too.",
  "str_voice_1501041_27": "The sound of burning flames... never fails to take me back to those painful times.",
  "str_voice_1501041_28": "So this is the Colossus that weathered the storm? It smells pretty cool.",
  "str_voice_1501041_29": "We meet again. Let's set some ground rules for our cooperation: No picking on Eve, no making her unhappy, and no letting her go hungry. Understand?",
  "str_voice_1501041_3": "Don't worry too much about me. My hearing is pretty good, and I've memorized every hallway and—OW! Who put this table here?",
  "str_voice_1501041_30": "I'm becoming stronger...",
  "str_voice_1501041_31": "I have to control this power...",
  "str_voice_1501041_32": "Some flowers only bloom once in their lives.",
  "str_voice_1501041_33": "Eternity in an instant.",
  "str_voice_1501041_34": "Understood.",
  "str_voice_1501041_35": "Flower blooming.",
  "str_voice_1501041_36": "Seize the opportunity!",
  "str_voice_1501041_37": "Now, let's go!",
  "str_voice_1501041_38": "Never forget this moment.",
  "str_voice_1501041_39": "I'm coming to help!",
  "str_voice_1501041_4": "This power isn't worth praising... I'm sure there are some dangers we still don't know about. After all, it's the power of Eclipsites.",
  "str_voice_1501041_40": "It's over.",
  "str_voice_1501041_41": "Can I do it?",
  "str_voice_1501041_42": "An undeniable outcome.",
  "str_voice_1501041_43": "Don't panic, just take deep breaths.",
  "str_voice_1501041_44": "I remember I should make a left here, then...",
  "str_voice_1501041_45": "Thanks for the gift.",
  "str_voice_1501041_46": "You're more considerate than I imagined.",
  "str_voice_1501041_47": "I'll treasure this.",
  "str_voice_1501041_48": "Our minds appear to be in tune with each other.",
  "str_voice_1501041_49": "My mother, and that woman... All they care about was research and experiments, but I never would've met Eve if it wasn't for them. Maybe this is destiny...",
  "str_voice_1501041_5": "That woman... I bet she's conducted even scarier researches than before. Just thinking about it gives me the creeps...",
  "str_voice_1501041_50": "I'll never forget those days in the laboratory. Eve was always there for me... Her kindness and purity made me feel that maybe the outside world wasn't so bad... that maybe I could sit in the sun again.",
  "str_voice_1501041_51": "The past is the past. We don't need to endure that kind of suffering anymore. I just wish these days would never end... And I'll do whatever I must to for that wish come true.",
  "str_voice_1501041_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1501041_53": "Hi, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1501041_54": "The sun's out again...",
  "str_voice_1501041_55": "Remember to eat healthily.",
  "str_voice_1501041_56": "The silence of the night always puts me in a good mood.",
  "str_voice_1501041_57": "Happy New Year! My New Year's resolution is to see Eve smile even more! What about you? Hmm, that's ambitious, but I'm sure you can do it.",
  "str_voice_1501041_6": "There are definitely others like me and Eve out in the world, and once I find them... I'll do everything I can to help them.",
  "str_voice_1501041_7": "Hmm, now we're close enough to share secrets with each other... So why don't you start?",
  "str_voice_1501041_8": "Not even in my dreams did I think I could have such a care-free life like this. Eve, Sinsa, the Rediesel Wrench... They're all my friends, and so are you.",
  "str_voice_1501041_9": "Flowers have a special meaning for Eve and me... They remind us of a time when we had to huddle together for warmth. But we don't worry about being lonely anymore... now that we have you.",
  "str_voice_1501131_1": "There are plenty of musicians in Lumopolis, and they're good at playing all kinds of music, but that doesn't mean they understand music, no?",
  "str_voice_1501131_10": "Hmm... You don't like this song? Would you like to hear \"Home\", \"Return\", or perhaps \"Voyage\" instead?",
  "str_voice_1501131_11": "Well, this seems like a good time for my Holy Avatars to take the stage, no? It's too quiet here... I'll make them play a song to liven up the atmosphere.",
  "str_voice_1501131_12": "The rooms here are exceptional. They're spacious and full of light. The main thing is that the acoustics is excellent. They're perfect for practicing my compositions, no?",
  "str_voice_1501131_13": "The ribbon on my hand? It's supposed to be attached to my baton; I just wrap it around my hand, like this.",
  "str_voice_1501131_14": "Performance depends on talent, and a conductor not only needs to be proficient in music theory but must also have the ability to coordinate their musicians. This is why conductors are so rare.",
  "str_voice_1501131_15": "Ah! I forgot to prepare a gift for you! Let my Holy Avatars present you with a birthday song!",
  "str_voice_1501131_16": "Another carefree day... Let my Holy Avatars play a song for you!",
  "str_voice_1501131_17": "Did you get up early to enjoy the morning sunshine, or perhaps to listen to nature's soothing song?",
  "str_voice_1501131_18": "You must be tired after working so hard all day. You need a rest... Why don't you go to the bridge and play the piano? Relax, Navigator!",
  "str_voice_1501131_19": "Inspiration comes to me late at night, so I usually embark on my compositions in the evening.",
  "str_voice_1501131_2": "The voice from above is most divine, is it not? But only I am the one who can play it. I must share with the world.",
  "str_voice_1501131_20": "The True Order is much better than Lumopolis. At least it admits that music comes in many different forms, no?",
  "str_voice_1501131_21": "Lumopolis possesses elegance and tradition, but it knows nothing about music...",
  "str_voice_1501131_22": "May the Truth bless you, and may music bless you, too.",
  "str_voice_1501131_23": "Poor things... If they don't know how to appreciate music, there's truly no hope for them...",
  "str_voice_1501131_24": "Victoria knows a great deal about many things, no? That's why I decided to follow her in search of the ultimate movement.",
  "str_voice_1501131_25": "If Sikare could free herself from the constraints of such rigid rules, her future would be limitless.",
  "str_voice_1501131_26": "There must be a piece of music on the mainland that can represent the true sound of the divine. I know I will find it someday...",
  "str_voice_1501131_27": "Rules and regulations can only produce mediocrity, such as the so-called musicians of Lumopolis, no?",
  "str_voice_1501131_28": "I hear that a piano is controlling this... It appears that music is all-powerful, no?",
  "str_voice_1501131_29": "I will guide you! Let us revel in the music of the divine together!",
  "str_voice_1501131_3": "The piano on the bridge is not half bad... Were you playing the piano on the Colossus for those seventeen years? I heard that you played a duet with Vice. It seems you have a good sense of music, no?",
  "str_voice_1501131_30": "This movement is getting divine.",
  "str_voice_1501131_31": "Listen! It's the voice of the divine!",
  "str_voice_1501131_32": "Comet, heed my words!",
  "str_voice_1501131_33": "Behold! I am the Divine Conductor!",
  "str_voice_1501131_34": "The voice of the divine will guide us.",
  "str_voice_1501131_35": "Movement... complete.",
  "str_voice_1501131_36": "Holy Avatars! Prepare to perform!",
  "str_voice_1501131_37": "Divine Conductor!",
  "str_voice_1501131_38": "Divine power, play on!",
  "str_voice_1501131_39": "Feel the resonance of the infinite!",
  "str_voice_1501131_4": "The servants I call the \"Holy Avatars\" were bestowed upon me. I can command them to play for you all night long...",
  "str_voice_1501131_40": "Let the divine move you!",
  "str_voice_1501131_41": "Everyone, follow my lead.",
  "str_voice_1501131_42": "Another perfect performance!",
  "str_voice_1501131_43": "Let my Holy Avatars cover our retreat...",
  "str_voice_1501131_44": "Would you like to see how I conduct?",
  "str_voice_1501131_45": "Ah, thank you.",
  "str_voice_1501131_46": "Wow, I really like this!",
  "str_voice_1501131_47": "You got me another gift!",
  "str_voice_1501131_48": "Let me compose a piece of music for you!",
  "str_voice_1501131_49": "An ultimate movement exists in this world. It represents the voice of the heavens, and I will not rest until I have found it.",
  "str_voice_1501131_5": "I've heard that the psychic abilities of the Caelestites are very powerful. So you can feel the fluctuations of my music, no?",
  "str_voice_1501131_50": "On that day, the voice of the divine reverberated through my body, and a meteorite fell from the sky. For a moment, the ultimate movement flickered in my heart, and I began my journey to find it.",
  "str_voice_1501131_51": "Lumopolis has never known what music is. This is the reason I was not selected to join them. So, I stayed in my hometown until I found my own path.",
  "str_voice_1501131_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1501131_53": "Do you have time for a duet?",
  "str_voice_1501131_54": "How about a song to get you out of bed?",
  "str_voice_1501131_55": "There shall be no midday performance. Take a break!",
  "str_voice_1501131_56": "Good night. Let my serenade send you to sleep.",
  "str_voice_1501131_57": "Happy New Year! Are you ready for a festive performance?",
  "str_voice_1501131_6": "I heard the voice of the divine again—it is more beautiful than any other music in the world. It shall guide me to find the ultimate movement, no?",
  "str_voice_1501131_7": "My eyesight is just fine. I wear these glasses to make me feel more like a conductor!",
  "str_voice_1501131_8": "Your psychic abilities are strong... Maybe you'd make a good conductor, too.",
  "str_voice_1501131_9": "See the ribbon on my hand? It's a nice little bow, no? Would you like me to teach you how to tie a beautiful bow like this? I'm really good at it.",
  "str_voice_1501141_1": "Would you be interested in trying on a bow tie? Although it's only a small accessory, it would suit what you're wearing right now.",
  "str_voice_1501141_10": "If there are no urgent matters to attend to at present, let's think about what we need to accomplish and make a simple plan. For example, how are we going to go about improving your ability...",
  "str_voice_1501141_11": "Umm... You want me to stay here? If I can't walk around as I please, I'm certain to grow restless...",
  "str_voice_1501141_12": "I hear there is a pub in the Rediesel Desert that sells liquor with a unique taste. Would you like to have a drink with me when you have time?",
  "str_voice_1501141_13": "You've been watching me, haven't you? Don't get carried away... I have a legion of admirers looking out for me.",
  "str_voice_1501141_14": "People are always complaining that there are no bounties in Umbraton... Hah! That's just because I've completed them all!",
  "str_voice_1501141_15": "Happy birthday! Will you be having a birthday party? Don't worry, I'll make all the arrangements!",
  "str_voice_1501141_16": "What a joyous day! How about you come for a ride with me? If you don't know how, I'll teach you. Riding is a basic requirement for all nobles.",
  "str_voice_1501141_17": "Getting up early is a commendable habit. It's a testament to your discipline, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1501141_18": "Dinner and a glass of gin... It's not for you, but for me, Navigator. This is what they call a \"nightcap\"...",
  "str_voice_1501141_19": "Ah... Fatigue has caught up with me, I need to rest. Aren't you sleepy?",
  "str_voice_1501141_2": "Are you familiar with a bounty hunter's trade? In fact, it's almost the same as a mercenary's lot, but with a higher degree of freedom. You just take down your target and receive your payment!",
  "str_voice_1501141_20": "Although the True Order doesn't have many members, we possess powerful secret skills, and can even revive the dead...",
  "str_voice_1501141_21": "Umbraton truly is a mixture of the good and the bad. If that were not the case, there'd be no place for her there...",
  "str_voice_1501141_22": "May the Truth trap... Oh no, bless you.",
  "str_voice_1501141_23": "Eclipsites? In my eyes, they're just rewards on legs.",
  "str_voice_1501141_24": "Victoria must be from a powerful lineage, otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to master such powerful Luminatics...",
  "str_voice_1501141_25": "Although she was not born to a family of renown, Sikare is a real noble, especially in her sense of responsibility.",
  "str_voice_1501141_26": "If there's anything in this world I'm willing to set aside my noble status for, it's a bottle of good gin.",
  "str_voice_1501141_27": "Whenever someone interferes with my affairs, I always get the urge to wrap my whip around their neck and tighten it a little more...",
  "str_voice_1501141_28": "Despite its size, it sure can fly! I wonder how it would fare in a race against Anna!",
  "str_voice_1501141_29": "Genevieve, bounty hunter extraordinaire, at your service! What can I do for you, Navigator? As long as the price is right, I'm all ears.",
  "str_voice_1501141_3": "These little Fireflies fluttering around here are so adorable that I can't help but want to use them for target practice. Don't worry! I won't break them.",
  "str_voice_1501141_30": "Whiplash, loosen up a bit, won't you?",
  "str_voice_1501141_31": "As expected, my power has surged once more!",
  "str_voice_1501141_32": "Anna, to the battlefield!",
  "str_voice_1501141_33": "Whiplash, set ablaze!",
  "str_voice_1501141_34": "Entrap the enemy!",
  "str_voice_1501141_35": "Fire of conquest! Prepare thyself!",
  "str_voice_1501141_36": "Ready for action!",
  "str_voice_1501141_37": "Burn!",
  "str_voice_1501141_38": "Surrender!",
  "str_voice_1501141_39": "Taste my flames!",
  "str_voice_1501141_4": "Everyone says I'm so charming, but really, it's all thanks to the gin.",

  "str_voice_1501471_9": "- Our honored guest is here! Momo, prepare your finest dishes!\n- Got it! You won't be disappointed!",
  "str_voice_1501491_1": "The secret to logistics? There's no secret... If there was one, then maybe the endless graveyard shifts? Huh? Doesn't sound like the Rediesel Wrench? Hahaha... Yeah, you're right.",
  "str_voice_1501491_10": "Hey, got time to chat? Do you want to hear more about the Eclipsites or learn how to survive in the desert? Don't leave me alone here! Lonely... I'm Mr. Lonely...",
  "str_voice_1501491_11": "You're asking an old guy like me to just stand here? Young people nowadays are so strange... Never mind. I'll look after you. If anything happens just talk to me and I'll take care of it.",
  "str_voice_1501491_12": "Fighting? I'm still good at it, I guess, but my back... Man, my prime is behind me.",
  "str_voice_1501491_13": "Want a candy? I have loads in my pockets. I recommend the red scorpion flavor!",
  "str_voice_1501491_14": "Huff... Hm? Haha! Nothing. I just had another nightmare last night. There's nothing to it.",
  "str_voice_1501491_15": "Today's your birthday? That's huge! We gotta throw a big party!",
  "str_voice_1501491_16": "Today's gonna be a busy day again... I just want to slack off... Don't push yourself too hard.",
  "str_voice_1501491_17": "Well whaddaya know! It's rare to see a young person up this early, at least at our place...",
  "str_voice_1501491_18": "How's your day? You still gotta eat and sleep even if you've got something troubling you.",
  "str_voice_1501491_19": "It's time for good kids to go to sleep. You can't sleep? Want a bedtime story?",
  "str_voice_1501491_2": "I made the Sweeties using leftover parts. I don't really know how they work, I guess I just got lucky... You think the name's cute? Well, Zeta came up with it.",
  "str_voice_1501491_20": "I'd do anything for the Rediesel Wrench.",
  "str_voice_1501491_21": "Illumina...? I'm not really familiar with it, but I do know all their supply routes.",
  "str_voice_1501491_22": "Live life to the fullest!",
  "str_voice_1501491_23": "Why I know the Eclipsites so well? Because... No... It's nothing.",
  "str_voice_1501491_24": "Sure, Azure can take care of herself. But it'd be nice if she wrote a letter once in a while and not just intelligence reports.",
  "str_voice_1501491_25": "That Sinsa guy is good leader material. Always charging forward and never looking back.",
  "str_voice_1501491_26": "Making stuffed toys is therapeutic. It's true! It's just a little embarrassing to talk to people about...",
  "str_voice_1501491_27": "Something I hate? Once you reach my age, you'll see that there's nothing much to hate anymore.",
  "str_voice_1501491_28": "Not bad! You're doing a great job with the logistics work at the Colossus.",
  "str_voice_1501491_29": "Hey! I'm Roy from the Rediesel Wrench. I apologize for all the trouble my little ones have caused you. Hahah! Good to see you!",
  "str_voice_1501491_3": "The Umbraton caravans got smarter, so now we've got to switch up the tactics. Huh? You're interested in planning ambushes? Do you know how to read a topographic map then? I'll teach you.",
  "str_voice_1501491_30": "Well, well, that feels great!",
  "str_voice_1501491_31": "But you shouldn't expect much from an old man like me...",
  "str_voice_1501491_32": "Whew... It makes me feel young again, if only for a bit.",
  "str_voice_1501491_33": "More responsibilities...?",
  "str_voice_1501491_34": "Guess I'll have to put in some work.",
  "str_voice_1501491_35": "Ring me up anytime.",
  "str_voice_1501491_36": "Heya. What do you need?",
  "str_voice_1501491_37": "Hmmm... Let's see...",
  "str_voice_1501491_38": "Time to replenish some glucose.",
  "str_voice_1501491_39": "Take that!",
  "str_voice_1501491_4": "Though I do want to make you a stuffed toy, the Colossus is a little tricky. How about a watermelon worm Eclipsite?",
  "str_voice_1501491_40": "Ooh, that's so scary⁠—NOT!",
  "str_voice_1501491_41": "My turn? Really? Fine...",
  "str_voice_1501491_42": "There's still some strength left in these old bones!",
  "str_voice_1501491_43": "Hey kid, are you alright?",
  "str_voice_1501491_44": "How about you let me modify your Colossus and give it some new capabilities?",
  "str_voice_1501491_45": "Fine, fine. Don't be such a stranger the next time.",
  "str_voice_1501491_46": "Oh? That's not cheap. Are you sure you want to give it to me?",
  "str_voice_1501491_47": "You really should save it for someone you care about, you know...?",
  "str_voice_1501491_48": "I'll have to repay you for this. What do you want? You can ask for anything!",
  "str_voice_1501491_49": "Those kids are a hard-to-please bunch, and they can be pretty darn mischievous, but they're good people. I'm overprotective of them? Ugh... Probably a little... But just a little.",
  "str_voice_1501491_5": "Close combat skills? Sure, but you gotta listen to me, okay? Throw sand at your opponent's eyes, and then sucker punch'em! Works every time! Cheating? Winning is all that matters, isn't it?",
  "str_voice_1501491_50": "Well, Sinsa really grew up to become a good leader... Hey, you wanna read some of the poems he wrote when he was small? They're adorable!",
  "str_voice_1501491_51": "Why I joined the Rediesel Wrench? Well, some fool once said to me, \"let's create a big and lively family together,\" so I joined like the fool that I was.",
  "str_voice_1501491_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1501491_53": "How have you been lately?",
  "str_voice_1501491_54": "Morning, young one!",
  "str_voice_1501491_55": "Remember to eat your lunch!",
  "str_voice_1501491_56": "You need a lot of rest if you're going to grow tall and strong.",
  "str_voice_1501491_57": "Happy New Year, Caelestite!",
  "str_voice_1501491_6": "If only your people were here during the war, then things might've turned out differently... You don't understand what I'm saying? Is this the \"generation gap\" people are talking about?",
  "str_voice_1501491_7": "Young man, won't you reconsider joining the Rediesel Wrench? How unfortunate. Our doors are open to you always, regardless.",
  "str_voice_1501491_8": "I'm tied down by my own past. I'll let you be the heroes and save the world. It already takes everything I've got to hold onto what I have now.",
  "str_voice_1501491_9": "Well... Isn't this what growing old is all about? Regretting the past... I can't forget, but creating new memories with you isn't a bad idea.",
  "str_voice_1501521_1": "What are you looking at? Stop it, or I'll poke you with my vines! Wait, that doesn't scare you? I'll have to try something different next time...",
  "str_voice_1501521_10": "I never slack off even when I have free time. All I need is you to remember that I'm here.",
  "str_voice_1501521_11": "Is this a new task for me? If I do it, then will everyone like me?",
  "str_voice_1501521_12": "Why did the passerby just side-eye me? I bet they hate me...",
  "str_voice_1501521_13": "Mr. Beau, stop! He just loves to run all over the place, it worries me.",
  "str_voice_1501521_14": "That girl there seems to be smiling at me... What do I do? How should I react?",
  "str_voice_1501521_15": "So many people wished you a happy birthday... I'm so jealous...",
  "str_voice_1501521_16": "My Beau loves to sleep during the day. What about yours? Oh... You don't have any children? That's a pity.",
  "str_voice_1501521_17": "Mr. Beau wakes up early. As a mother, I must get up earlier. No time to chat. I need to prepare his breakfast.",
  "str_voice_1501521_18": "Remember to brush your teeth and wash your face before bed! Who taught me this? That doesn't matter.",
  "str_voice_1501521_19": "Why do you enjoy walking around at night so much just like my Beau?",
  "str_voice_1501521_2": "My stitches? Ahahah. They're all different. Like 'em? You can get some stitches next time.",
  "str_voice_1501521_20": "The True Order is Mr. Beau's and my home. Truth is where we dwell always.",
  "str_voice_1501521_21": "I heard Lumopolis has a hard time accepting Truth. How strange!",
  "str_voice_1501521_22": "May the Truth bless you. Ahahah.",
  "str_voice_1501521_23": "Eclipsites attack me whenever they see me. I bet they hate me... But at least I hated them first.",
  "str_voice_1501521_24": "Lenore... She's a puppet with no emotions. You shouldn't waste your feelings on her.",
  "str_voice_1501521_25": "I wish I could be popular as Miss Genevieve... *cough* You didn't hear anything!",
  "str_voice_1501521_26": "Do you have someone you like? I can help sew you together. Ahahah.",
  "str_voice_1501521_27": "Aah! Beau's hair is tangled again. Mommy failed you, it's all my fault!",
  "str_voice_1501521_28": "Does the Colossus like me? I'll only like it if it likes me.",
  "str_voice_1501521_29": "Ahahah. To think I thought you were all that. But you can't escape from my palm either. Huh? What? Oh, you came here out of your own volition?",
  "str_voice_1501521_3": "There, there my sweet little Beau... Ah! Please don't misunderstand. I'm talking to my precious. Can't you see this big fluffy ball?",
  "str_voice_1501521_30": "I'm so happy.",
  "str_voice_1501521_31": "Getting closer... Getting even closer!",
  "str_voice_1501521_32": "This feeling... Is this Truth?",
  "str_voice_1501521_33": "The vine is blooming.",
  "str_voice_1501521_34": "*coughs* I suppose we could.",
  "str_voice_1501521_35": "The vine has come back to life.",
  "str_voice_1501521_36": "Binding, or whipping?",
  "str_voice_1501521_37": "Bad, bad! Get ready for your punishment!",
  "str_voice_1501521_38": "A big flower for you.",
  "str_voice_1501521_39": "So annoying!",
  "str_voice_1501521_4": "The hair my baby Beau sheds is a valuable item. It can be made into the strongest thread. Where else do you think I get my sewing thread?",
  "str_voice_1501521_40": "Bon voyage!",
  "str_voice_1501521_41": "I... I'm not scared.",
  "str_voice_1501521_42": "How did I do earlier? Fabulous?",
  "str_voice_1501521_43": "No, it wasn't my fault...",
  "str_voice_1501521_44": "Ah... This place looks fun.",
  "str_voice_1501521_45": "Is this an assignment?",
  "str_voice_1501521_46": "A gift for me?!",
  "str_voice_1501521_47": "Holy cra...b! Are these crabs?",
  "str_voice_1501521_48": "I-I'll sew it into my pocket.",
  "str_voice_1501521_49": "Beau's mama is May. May's mama? I don't really remember what she looks like.",
  "str_voice_1501521_5": "How would you rank my abilities in the True Order? Wait! I'm not ready... Tell me another time.",
  "str_voice_1501521_50": "When I saw that poor little thing, I suddenly realized... I might not be anyone's precious baby but I can have my own!",
  "str_voice_1501521_51": "I no longer need Mama's approval. The True Order's acknowledgement is genuine and sacred, beyond doubt. It's what I've always wanted.",
  "str_voice_1501521_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1501521_53": "A—ha—hah!",
  "str_voice_1501521_54": "Yes, it's about dawn.",
  "str_voice_1501521_55": "Half of a day is half a day.",
  "str_voice_1501521_56": "Oh, it's getting dark.",
  "str_voice_1501521_57": "Sew and patch. Another year is here. Happy New Year.",
  "str_voice_1501521_6": "Got it? Praise makes obedient children. Ahem... Now it's your turn. You're asking me what you should say? Hmm... you still don't get it.",
  "str_voice_1501521_7": "Navigator, you haven't talked to me for 68 seconds. I'm right next to you but you aren't talking to me... Are you annoyed with me?",
  "str_voice_1501521_8": "Hmm... I'm okay. Just pondering over a serious problem. Should Mr. Beau call you uncle or grandpa?",
  "str_voice_1501521_9": "Shush... I have a top secret to share with you. I'm only telling you! Inside this bag are lots of cat's whiskers I've collected. They're my good luck charms!",
  "str_voice_1501571_1": "Well uh... As you can see, I'm a maid. I can... do laundry, and cook, and-and... If you'd like, I can tell you bedtime stories from the Far East.",
  "str_voice_1501571_10": "-Hey you! Are you deaf?! How long are you going to keep Sanae waiting?\n-Ah... Sister, don't speak to Mr. Navigator that way! Um, s-sorry! I don't mind waiting... Really.",
  "str_voice_1501571_11": "-Eh...? P... pleased to be at your service!\n-Ahem, let's get the salary settled first.",
  "str_voice_1501571_12": "Um... the flying birds in the Colossus... are they called Fireflies? I wonder what they would taste like... Huh? I can't eat them? Oh... sorry! I won't take Mr. Navigator's food without permission.",
  "str_voice_1501571_13": "Actually... being a maid isn't my first job. I've sold newspapers, been a painter, and been a baggage carrier at the docks... but I always got fired really fast.",
  "str_voice_1501571_14": "-Phew... When will I pay off the debt...\n-PlayerName, perhaps it's time to give me a pay raise?",
  "str_voice_1501571_15": "-Well... Is it your birthday today? Happy Birthday!\n-Your birthday gift will have to wait until I get paid.",
  "str_voice_1501571_16": "Ahhh... Good day. Why... why are you looking at me like that? Um... Am I not working hard enough?",
  "str_voice_1501571_17": "Uh... er... dear Mr. Navigator, it's time to get up. Breakfast is... ready.",
  "str_voice_1501571_18": "Y-You must be very tired after working all day! Shall I warm a glass of milk for you?",
  "str_voice_1501571_19": "-Oh... Mr. Navigator, is there anything I can do for you?\n-Why are you here again? It's time to go home!",
  "str_voice_1501571_2": "-Is this PlayerName person reliable?\n-I feel like... Ah! Mr. Navigator? When did you arrive? Um, this is my sister Manae...",
  "str_voice_1501571_20": "-Cloud Island... is truly a beautiful place.\n-It's hard to comment on anywhere else.",
  "str_voice_1501571_21": "-Thank you, Umbraton, for accepting me as I am...\n-Hmph, not everyone here is so great.",
  "str_voice_1501571_22": "-Work... make money... pay off debt...\n-Have a good meal.",
  "str_voice_1501571_23": "-Eclipsites... are so terrifying, and they eat people... so scary!\n-I'm here. Fear not!",
  "str_voice_1501571_24": "Lady Bethel is such a kind person! She's been helping me with my job hunt.",
  "str_voice_1501571_25": "Manae is always by my side, helping me when I'm in trouble... If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have made it this far.",
  "str_voice_1501571_26": "Eh... things I like? Ah, well... I like... I like to... eat. Does that count?",
  "str_voice_1501571_27": "-Liars, scumbags, get out of here!\n-... Shh, Mr. Navigator isn't that kind of person... I think.",
  "str_voice_1501571_28": "-The Colossus... can it fly to Cloud Island really quickly?\n-Now is not the time to go back yet.",
  "str_voice_1501571_29": "Ouch! That hurt... Eh? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to knock you over! I-I'm... Sanae. Do you need me to carry you to the clinic?",
  "str_voice_1501571_3": "Manae really cares about me, she always protects me. It's all my fault for being so useless... But I'll work harder! Please don't fire me!",
  "str_voice_1501571_30": "It'll definitely work... this time...",
  "str_voice_1501571_31": "My power... is steaming like a bowl of hot rice.",

  "str_voice_1501571_35": "Waaah, this should be good enough...",
  "str_voice_1501571_36": "Oh, um, I...",
  "str_voice_1501571_37": "Please, Manae!",
  "str_voice_1501571_38": "Hey, get out of my way!",
  "str_voice_1501571_39": "Yeaargh!",
  "str_voice_1501571_4": "-Before coming to Astra to work... I never knew I had to worry about Eclipsites.\n-Who's going to compensate me for my mental health?",

  "str_voice_1501571_43": "Oh no... I'll get fired...",
  "str_voice_1501571_44": "-Are there any jobs available here?\n-Paid ones.",

  "str_voice_1501571_46": "-Thank you...\n-How generous of you.",
  "str_voice_1501571_47": "-You're so kind to me...\n-Keep your intentions pure.",
  "str_voice_1501571_48": "-I love you! You are my favorite!\n-Don't be silly. She meant the gift.",
  "str_voice_1501571_49": "When I was at my lowest, I met a pink-haired girl. Without her, I would never have been able to get on a ship for Astra...",
  "str_voice_1501571_5": "-Is it just my imagination... or am I tripping less often lately?\n-Hehe, you've grown up it seems.",
  "str_voice_1501571_50": "-When Mother and Father were away... Uncle Hansuke took me in.\n-That man was such a bastard! He deserved to get put away in prison.",

  "str_voice_1501601_18": "Are you on a night stroll? That's a nice idea.\nMind if I join?",
  "str_voice_1501601_19": "Still up? What a weirdo.\nThough the same goes for me.",
  "str_voice_1501601_2": "Is this the Colossus?\nIt's a unique experience to overlook the land from the sky.",
  "str_voice_1501601_20": "I want to explore the mysteries of this world too, so let's go!",
  "str_voice_1501601_21": "Taila, cat ears, dragon horns...\nThe creator of this world\nsure has taste.",
  "str_voice_1501601_22": "Come, let me show you the most aesthetic performance you've ever seen.",
  "str_voice_1501601_23": "Eclipsite figures...\nThere's no artistic value in them whatsoever.",
  "str_voice_1501601_24": "Joker is a trustworthy leader.",

  "str_voice_1501601_29": "This is Fox of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.\nYou need me, right?",
  "str_voice_1501601_3": "There's no traffic expenses to worry about in this world... Nice.",
  "str_voice_1501601_30": "The application of blade and brush share some similarities.",
  "str_voice_1501601_31": "I've gotten more powerful, it feels like.",
  "str_voice_1501601_32": "It's going well. Keep it up.",
  "str_voice_1501601_33": "Push them back, Goemon!",
  "str_voice_1501601_34": "Time for me to shine.",

  "str_voice_1501601_46": "A gift for me?\nOh, how lovely!",
  "str_voice_1501601_47": "Are you sure? It's a very nice gift... I shall appreciate it.",
  "str_voice_1501601_48": "Terrific, absolutely terrific!\nYou really know what I like!",
  "str_voice_1501601_49": "As long as I can draw and paint, I don't care where I am.",

  "str_voice_1501601_7": "You calling yourself the Last Caelestite would be equivalent to me calling myself the Future Star of Nihonga.",
  "str_voice_1501601_8": "The Colossus is so spacious, I even want to lend a room from you as my studio.",
  "str_voice_1501601_9": "This world has so many things I've never seen before, inspiration is just pouring in!",

  "str_voice_1501611_12": "There are two stomachs: one for dessert and one for entrees.\nThat remains a fact no matter which world you're in.",
  "str_voice_1501611_13": "What I see here might serve as inspiration for my performances.",
  "str_voice_1501611_14": "Don't forget to stay hydrated when training.",
  "str_voice_1501611_15": "Happy birthday!",
  "str_voice_1501611_16": "Have a sip of tea and take a break.",
  "str_voice_1501611_17": "Good morning! Want to exercise with me?",
  "str_voice_1501611_18": "You've had a long day. Please rest well.",
  "str_voice_1501611_19": "It's bad to stay up late.\nI've got to get to sleep too.",
  "str_voice_1501611_2": "Vice makes odd dishes for us. I do mind how they taste, but I worry more about whether they can fill me up.",
  "str_voice_1501611_20": "I appreciate the effort!",
  "str_voice_1501611_21": "I'm dead serious in a battle and go all out!",
  "str_voice_1501611_22": "Go, go!",
  "str_voice_1501611_23": "Eclipsites...\nThey look rabid...",
  "str_voice_1501611_24": "I shall strive to be an asset to everyone!",
  "str_voice_1501611_25": "Mona can transform into a car! Is that common in this world?",
  "str_voice_1501611_26": "My likes?\nTasty food, of course! But I have to control myself before big compeitions...",
  "str_voice_1501611_27": "Dislikes?\nProbably falling into a slump.",
  "str_voice_1501611_28": "You can communicate with the Colossus?\nThat sounds somewhat unbelievable.",
  "str_voice_1501611_29": "My code name is Violet.\nI'll strive to better myself for everyone's sake.",
  "str_voice_1501611_3": "Say, do you know what rhythmic gymnastics is?",
  "str_voice_1501611_30": "I feel more powerful!",
  "str_voice_1501611_31": "I shall meet your expectations!",
  "str_voice_1501611_32": "I'll give it my all!",
  "str_voice_1501611_33": "Dance, Cendrillon!",
  "str_voice_1501611_34": "Let's do this!",
  "str_voice_1501611_35": "I've got this!",
  "str_voice_1501611_36": "Just like a butterfly!",
  "str_voice_1501611_37": "Grab victory by the hand!",
  "str_voice_1501611_38": "Dance, Persona!",
  "str_voice_1501611_39": "Concentrate!",
  "str_voice_1501611_4": "I hope you can tell me more about this world.",
  "str_voice_1501611_40": "Time to reflect!",
  "str_voice_1501611_41": "Ready!",
  "str_voice_1501611_42": "Spectacular ending!",
  "str_voice_1501611_43": "I cannot fail...",
  "str_voice_1501611_44": "Can we have celebrations on the Colossus?",
  "str_voice_1501611_45": "I'll take it!",
  "str_voice_1501611_46": "A gift for me? I'm so happy!",
  "str_voice_1501611_47": "Thanks!",
  "str_voice_1501611_48": "Can I really accept such a nice gift?",
  "str_voice_1501611_49": "I'll do anything to fulfill that dream!",
  "str_voice_1501611_5": "Everybody here also has their own duties and chores, I presume.",
  "str_voice_1501611_50": "I myself am the only one who can make the decision!",
  "str_voice_1501611_51": "I'll march onward with Cendrillon... Together, as one!",
  "str_voice_1501611_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1501611_57": "Happy New Year!\nKeep your spirits up for this year too!",
  "str_voice_1501611_58": "Perfect score!",
  "str_voice_1501611_6": "You must stretch properly before a fight. Would you like me to show you how?",
  "str_voice_1501611_7": "I'm very glad that I meet others' expectations, but I do feel the pressure too.",
  "str_voice_1501611_8": "So this is called the Colossus... It's astonishing how many things are inside!",
  "str_voice_1501611_9": "What am I doing...?\nIf I must say, zoning out!",
  "str_voice_1501621_1": "I'm not a cat! I'm Mona!",
  "str_voice_1501621_10": "I'm gonna take a nap if you keep brushing me off.",
  "str_voice_1501621_11": "Oh, is it my turn now?",
  "str_voice_1501621_12": "I promise I'll do really well this time, so have my reward ready.\nBig fat tuna sashimi will do.",
  "str_voice_1501621_13": "I get excited when I realize I'm flying in the sky right now.",
  "str_voice_1501621_14": "It's nice to be able to experience a different culture and broaden my horizons. It's made me more charming, too.",
  "str_voice_1501621_15": "Happy birthday! I look forward to continuing being in your care!",
  "str_voice_1501621_16": "Meow! I'm doing just as well as ever!",
  "str_voice_1501621_17": "How did you sleep? Well then, let's work hard today, too!",
  "str_voice_1501621_18": "The day sure went by fast. Is there anything still left to do?",
  "str_voice_1501621_19": "Let's get some sleep first!",
  "str_voice_1501621_2": "I think this place is amazing.",
  "str_voice_1501621_20": "The Phantom Thieves will always complete a job with grace, no matter when.",
  "str_voice_1501621_21": "Yep, right up my alley!",
  "str_voice_1501621_22": "Let the battle commence!",
  "str_voice_1501621_23": "Eclipsites... A thorough investigation will be necessary.",
  "str_voice_1501621_24": "I trained the Phantom Thieves myself, there's no job they can't do!",
  "str_voice_1501621_25": "The Phantom Thieves are cool? Well obviously.\nI handpicked all of them, after all.",
  "str_voice_1501621_26": "Likes?\nAssuming you're talking about people, how should I put this...? There are a few...",
  "str_voice_1501621_27": "Dislikes? How about people who mock others for working hard?",
  "str_voice_1501621_28": "How does one as huge as the Colossus fly?",
  "str_voice_1501621_29": "It should be your honor to meet me!",
  "str_voice_1501621_3": "I'm not quite familiar with this world yet, so I'll leave the navigating to you.",
  "str_voice_1501621_30": "I see my charm has amplified even more!",
  "str_voice_1501621_31": "This is how powerful I am!",
  "str_voice_1501621_32": "Leave it to me!",
  "str_voice_1501621_33": "Charge, Zorro!",
  "str_voice_1501621_34": "My turn!",
  "str_voice_1501621_35": "I'm ready!",
  "str_voice_1501621_36": "It's too late for regrets!",
  "str_voice_1501621_37": "Come out, my Persona!",
  "str_voice_1501621_38": "Witness my determination!",
  "str_voice_1501621_39": "Wake up!",
  "str_voice_1501621_4": "Keeping our identities anonymous is how the phantom thieves do things.",
  "str_voice_1501621_40": "Goodbye forever!",
  "str_voice_1501621_41": "I shall give my orders!",
  "str_voice_1501621_42": "Bravo, everyone!",
  "str_voice_1501621_43": "Is this the end...",
  "str_voice_1501621_44": "Hey, can the Colossus transform like I do?",
  "str_voice_1501621_45": "Oh, thanks.",
  "str_voice_1501621_46": "For me? Thank you!",
  "str_voice_1501621_47": "Really? Thank you. I'm so happy!",
  "str_voice_1501621_48": "I can have this? Yay!",
  "str_voice_1501621_49": "When all this is over, I'd like to throw a victory party.",
  "str_voice_1501621_5": "I look forward to working with you!",
  "str_voice_1501621_50": "My memory's hazy, but I'll let my actions speak for themselves! That's why I'm the ace!",
  "str_voice_1501621_51": "Don't know when I started being surrounded by people all the time. That's something I couldn't imagine when I was by myself.",
  "str_voice_1501621_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1501621_57": "Happy New Year! My resolution is to train you hard in the new year, so be prepared!",
  "str_voice_1501621_58": "Cleanup done!",
  "str_voice_1501621_6": "All right, then, let's go!",
  "str_voice_1501621_7": "As a Phantom Thief, I must retain the \"Help the weak, don't cower to those in power\" mentality.",
  "str_voice_1501621_8": "You need to train harder if you want to be mighty like me!",
  "str_voice_1501621_9": "Meow, shiny trinkets!\nWhat? It was just a dream?",
  "str_voice_1501651_1": "The drive is the foundation of dynamic mecha, and it must account for energy materials, conversion ratio, structure, and transmission. Oh, it's just all so complicated.",
  "str_voice_1501651_10": "How about sitting in the mecha and taking a nap? Nobody else is here. Um, C-Ce... I'm not slacking off!",
  "str_voice_1501651_11": "You can leave the engineering problems to me, but I can only act as an assistant in other areas. I can't even give advice. Is this really okay?",
  "str_voice_1501651_12": "I heard that you've been to many places, have you encountered anything new and fascinating? Such as the green ores from Northland or sandworm blood from the Rediesel Desert?",
  "str_voice_1501651_13": "Scientists are the most important. They're the soul of an organization, much like the engine of a mech unit!",
  "str_voice_1501651_14": "Who invented long-distance running and swimming? These things should be obliterated from existence, like errors in design drafts!",
  "str_voice_1501651_15": "I believe birthdays involve gifts. What do you want? How about a dynamic mecha model?",
  "str_voice_1501651_16": "Navigator, have you made a schedule for today? Otherwise, things might get out of hand.",
  "str_voice_1501651_17": "You got up early. Do you want to tune the Colossus?",
  "str_voice_1501651_18": "Sometimes a break is necessary, such as lying in a hammock for a while.",
  "str_voice_1501651_19": "The middle of the night is the ideal time for making calculations and sketching designs! Of course, it would be even better with inspiration.",
  "str_voice_1501651_2": "I wonder if there are Caelestite scientists because I'm not sure how to maintain this incredible Colossus. C-Ce... Did I say something I shouldn't have?",
  "str_voice_1501651_20": "Illumina has assembled all of Astra's top scientists, and I am lucky to have their guidance.",
  "str_voice_1501651_21": "Some of the Rediesel Wrench artisans are puzzling. They lack any concrete knowledge of science, but they can fix things based simply off experience.",
  "str_voice_1501651_22": "Splendor Illumina! I must complete that dynamic mecha!",
  "str_voice_1501651_23": "The Eclipsites' body structures resemble some type of sophisticated machinery, I wonder who created them...",
  "str_voice_1501651_24": "Without Tech Officer Gronru, I'd still be stuck drafting designs, unable to make heads or tails of this dynamic mecha.",
  "str_voice_1501651_25": "Chief Charon is a genius when it comes to conducting and controlling trains, but in everyday life... Ahem, well, it's fine once you get used to it.",
  "str_voice_1501651_26": "Even if I had ten times the IQ, I still wouldn't be able to invent something as comfy as a hammock! If I didn't have to work on the mecha unit, I'd lie in it for 20 hours a day if I could.",
  "str_voice_1501651_27": "Those who mock others in public should be put inside a ladle furnace.",
  "str_voice_1501651_28": "Its structure, systems, and components are far beyond current technological capabilities. I wonder about the geniuses behind such a design...",
  "str_voice_1501651_29": "I may be in charge of tunnel excavation, but I'm actually an engineer! This dynamic mecha is my creation, but it's still an unfinished prototype. Don't touch it! Oh, by the way, my name is Ciel.",
  "str_voice_1501651_3": "Many of the Caelestite's things are mysterious. I tried for a whole day and night to draw the front view of a Firefly, but I failed...",
  "str_voice_1501651_30": "My technological powers have grown stronger.",
  "str_voice_1501651_31": "System updated.",
  "str_voice_1501651_32": "Framework patched.",
  "str_voice_1501651_33": "I'm feeling full of power and energy.",
  "str_voice_1501651_34": "Do you need help excavating a tunnel?",
  "str_voice_1501651_35": "Styx, get ready.",
  "str_voice_1501651_36": "The solar arrows are on standby.",
  "str_voice_1501651_37": "Solar arrows, unleash!",
  "str_voice_1501651_38": "Solar arrows, shower down!",
  "str_voice_1501651_39": "No dead ends! Fire!",
  "str_voice_1501651_4": "Drafting designs is a form of art! Vice is correct. And it's superior to drawing because it relies only on precision.",
  "str_voice_1501651_40": "Full load! Fire!",
  "str_voice_1501651_41": "Let me be the team's engine!",
  "str_voice_1501651_42": "As easy as tightening a screw!",
  "str_voice_1501651_43": "I've dug an escape tunnel...",
  "str_voice_1501651_44": "The structure of this Colossus is so unique. I must measure and study it in detail.",
  "str_voice_1501651_45": "I'll put it in my room.",
  "str_voice_1501651_46": "Wow! This? I'll take it!",
  "str_voice_1501651_47": "Thank you. How can I return the favor?",
  "str_voice_1501651_48": "Great! How about I make a dynamic mecha suit for you as well?",
  "str_voice_1501651_49": "The dynamic mecha on the legs doesn't match the current set; it was the result of a failed project.",
  "str_voice_1501651_5": "Dynamic mecha are useful not only in combat, but also in exploration, excavation, and construction. They will be critical machines in the Illumina Federation's future.",
  "str_voice_1501651_50": "My parents are ordinary workers, but they encouraged me to become an engineer. As it turns out, they made the right choice.",
  "str_voice_1501651_51": "If I didn't have such a proclivity for playing around, I probably would've completed the perfect dynamic mecha suit by now.",
  "str_voice_1501651_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1501651_53": "You're here, right?",
  "str_voice_1501651_54": "Morning's the best time to wind up your gears!",
  "str_voice_1501651_55": "Even machines need to take a nap after lunch.",
  "str_voice_1501651_56": "Work can be put on a momentary pause.",
  "str_voice_1501651_57": "Yet another new year... I should hurry up with the dynamic mecha design.",
  "str_voice_1501651_6": "Navigator, I've come to a new conclusion regarding my blueprint design! My previous calculations were incorrect, but this time everything appears just fine and dandy, so the perfect dynamic mecha suit should soon be...",
  "str_voice_1501651_7": "Do you want to sketch designs? I have a compass and ruler, both of which are family heirlooms. I've never let anyone borrow them... Not even Vice.",
  "str_voice_1501651_8": "Navigator, shouldn't the Colossus undergo some major repairs? Or perhaps an update or two? Don't worry, I'll give you plenty of engineering assistance.",
  "str_voice_1501651_9": "C-Ce... This dynamic mecha suit is unlikely to last much longer. Can you repair it using Caelestite technology?",
  "str_voice_1501681_1": "Greetings, dear audience. Let me hear your voices! Oh? How come I hear nothing? Anyone fancy themselves a cool shower? The Azure Blaster in my hand may be able to help.",
  "str_voice_1501681_10": "No applause? Well, even I'd feel kind of lonely if you don't cooperate.",
  "str_voice_1501681_11": "No more simple warm up and stage announcements? A-Am I finally allowed to deliver a real, complete performance!? Wow... You're so nice to me!!",
  "str_voice_1501681_12": "Things get really hectic in the circus when it rains. We have to put away all the props and then deal with loudspeakers that have gotten wet... Speaking of which, I'm quite good at repairing those things!",
  "str_voice_1501681_13": "Everyone just says I'm popular to make me happy! I'd never jump ship. I wanna stay with the circus to learn more from the marine engineer!",
  "str_voice_1501681_14": "I just repaired a water bucket. How's that? Does it look nice? Hee hee. I think so too! But it's still leaking everywhere...",
  "str_voice_1501681_15": "Happy birthday!! I'll keep you company today no matter what you want to do!",
  "str_voice_1501681_16": "Hi! Would you like to catch fish with me today? With a net? No! Catching fish with your bare hands is way more fun!",
  "str_voice_1501681_17": "Morning! I think I just saw a pretty awesome ocean-going ship! Hm? Oh, that was a little Courier?",
  "str_voice_1501681_18": "There's no performance today. What should I do? Schedule out my evening? There's no need. We'll just go with the flow.",
  "str_voice_1501681_19": "Why are you still awake? Were you waiting for me to ask you to sleep? Alright, go to sleep then!",
  "str_voice_1501681_2": "Geez. Are you frowning? Come frolick in water with me if you feel down! Come on. Imagine... that this is the vast sea and we're bobbing up and down as we float over waves...",
  "str_voice_1501681_20": "The Emerald is the best! Followed by the ship I'll make in the future! Oh, I forgot about Soroz...",
  "str_voice_1501681_21": "Illuminans always seem to carry interesting gadgets. I'd love to go there one day!",
  "str_voice_1501681_22": "I'll always protect you!",
  "str_voice_1501681_23": "How many more enemies like this do I need to defeat?",
  "str_voice_1501681_24": "Ringmaster Jeno may seem cold and indifferent, but if you talk to him a bit more... Hee hee hee.",
  "str_voice_1501681_25": "I will become an excellent marine engineer like my master one day... Right?",

  "str_voice_1501681_28": "S-Soroz the Giant Ship!! Sigh... Why couldn't I have been born a Caelestite? Then I'd be able to talk to it...",
  "str_voice_1501681_29": "Hey! How goes it? I'm Rainbow, the sole appointed guardian of the Emerald! A new member of the circus? That's just my part-time job!",
  "str_voice_1501681_3": "I've had vocal lessons! The kind to make your voice clearer and sweeter. Hee hee, I did it to ensure that all visitors who attend our performances can hear my words clearly.",

  "str_voice_1501681_31": "Water pressure going up!",

  "str_voice_1501681_4": "I can't control myself! I wanna blast the whole world with water and give it all the refreshing coolness I can!",
  "str_voice_1501681_40": "Pressure blast!",
  "str_voice_1501681_41": "Ahh! Got it!",

  "str_voice_1501681_49": "I practically grew up in the water. I used to follow my parents out to sea to catch fish when I was young and ran about holding this water gun my dad made me. Ha ha ha.",
  "str_voice_1501681_5": "Whew! I feel like I've already built plenty of ships! Not just giant ships like the Emerald, but also ironclad ships, fishing vessels, seafaring ships... Hehe, I'm just talking about models, of course.",
  "str_voice_1501681_50": "Plank No. 1 and Fishing Rod No. 2 were my companions when I lived out at sea alone. I don't know what I would've done without them during the period right after losing my parents.",

  "str_voice_1501681_55": "Good afternoon! It's so hot today!",
  "str_voice_1501681_56": "I have a performance tonight!",
  "str_voice_1501681_57": "Happy New Year! I'll continue to deliver performances while working hard towards my goal of becoming a marine engineer this year!",
  "str_voice_1501681_6": "I'm Rainbow, chief guardian of the Emerald. I'm always ready to be on the move! You can count on me for diving, fish scouting, and daily maintenance of the Emerald! Please give your command!",

  "str_voice_1501681_9": "Is our relationship what I think it is? Y-You must talk like this to everyone, right?",
  "str_voice_1501711_1": "To be honest, I feel at ease living in Euphoria because there's no need to pay any mind to anything except survival.",
  "str_voice_1501711_10": "This kind of peace can make a person lazy, and laziness leads to complacency, which makes one weak. Rest assured, that'll never happen to me.",

  "str_voice_1501711_12": "Losing my right leg hasn't been all bad, you know? At least now, every step I take is completely thought out.",
  "str_voice_1501711_13": "Pollux? I don't need to keep a constant watch over her. Our hearts are connected, so we know what's happening to one another better than anyone else.",
  "str_voice_1501711_14": "I feel like I can do anything whenever I'm with you. Is this what it feels like to be trusted?",
  "str_voice_1501711_15": "Happy birthday. I got something for you. Er, I wouldn't get too excited about it, though.",
  "str_voice_1501711_16": "Have you eaten yet? I have to keep my blood sugar high before battle, or else it could mean trouble.",
  "str_voice_1501711_17": "I've gotten so used to cloudy skies. Will I finally have a chance to see the sun, too?",
  "str_voice_1501711_18": "I'm not bothering you, am I? Sorry, I'm still breaking in this new prosthetic leg.",
  "str_voice_1501711_19": "Don't worry, I'm still here. I'll remain in your view until the morning comes.",
  "str_voice_1501711_2": "Oh, you don't need to be wary of me. I only pull something like that with Nekoyashiki. Besides, my aim is flawless.",
  "str_voice_1501711_20": "With just two people, Raven's Blood managed to carve out their own turf in Euphoria. Pretty impressive, huh?",
  "str_voice_1501711_21": "That Corax guy from Umbraton seems pretty dependable. I guess there might be some merit to that place, after all.",
  "str_voice_1501711_22": "Think twice before provoking the wrath of Raven's Blood.",
  "str_voice_1501711_23": "Eh, these things are not much different from the targets at an amusement park's shooting booth.",
  "str_voice_1501711_24": "We stopped needing words to describe our relationship a long time ago. All that needs saying is that I'll always stand by her side.",
  "str_voice_1501711_25": "He may not admit it, but it's clear to me that he's done a lot for us. Just don't tell him I said so!",
  "str_voice_1501711_26": "If you really trust me this much, then... I don't need any payment from you.",
  "str_voice_1501711_27": "Cumbersome tasks... I do them when asked, but not because I want to.",
  "str_voice_1501711_28": "For something as big as this Colossus to fly through the sky so freely... I can't say I'm not jealous.",
  "str_voice_1501711_29": "I'm no professional, but you won't be disappointed with my skills. First things first though: You better pay me for my skills' worth.",
  "str_voice_1501711_3": "Fighting is for keeping the people and places you love from being taken from you.",
  "str_voice_1501711_30": "Mm, this feels great.",
  "str_voice_1501711_31": "Told you my skills were the real deal.",
  "str_voice_1501711_32": "Let's talk about a raise, huh?",
  "str_voice_1501711_33": "Victory is assured.",
  "str_voice_1501711_34": "You... want me to work in a team?",
  "str_voice_1501711_35": "Best position secured.",
  "str_voice_1501711_36": "Awaiting your orders.",
  "str_voice_1501711_37": "This blade's not just for show.",
  "str_voice_1501711_38": "I hate moving targets.",
  "str_voice_1501711_39": "A perfect shot.",
  "str_voice_1501711_4": "Drawing your gun too slowly is equivalent to handing your life over to the enemy. Trust me, I'll never let that happen.",
  "str_voice_1501711_40": "Knock 'em all down!",
  "str_voice_1501711_41": "Let's improvise and adapt.",
  "str_voice_1501711_42": "Just as I expected.",
  "str_voice_1501711_43": "Lady Luck's on vacation...",
  "str_voice_1501711_44": "Looks like Lady Luck has her eyes on me today.",
  "str_voice_1501711_45": "Is this my bonus? Thanks.",
  "str_voice_1501711_46": "The kids will love this. Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1501711_47": "Did Lady Luck tell you this was my favorite?",
  "str_voice_1501711_48": "This makes me anticipate your next gift very much. No pressure, of course.",
  "str_voice_1501711_49": "Pollux has been more to me than a friend or family member for a long time. I've never had any desire to be a hero, but I would do anything to protect her... even become a villain.",
  "str_voice_1501711_5": "This work has really improved my skills as a mercenary, so thanks for that. Looks like Lady Luck hasn't given up on me yet.",
  "str_voice_1501711_50": "At first, I didn't realize just how lucky I was. But that might not have been such a bad thing. Once you start relying on this kind of good fortune, you find out quickly that it's always accompanied by misfortune in equal measure.",
  "str_voice_1501711_51": "They say it's easy for people to get addicted to the bitterness of hardship, and I'm no different. A life of strife suits me just fine. Oh, but as for cigarettes, Pollux and I swore off that stuff long ago.",
  "str_voice_1501711_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1501711_53": "You there?",
  "str_voice_1501711_54": "Remember not to skip breakfast.",
  "str_voice_1501711_55": "The noon sun is too bright.",
  "str_voice_1501711_56": "Another peaceful day. Good night.",
  "str_voice_1501711_57": "Happy New Year. Looks like we made it safely through another year.",
  "str_voice_1501711_6": "No matter what kind of life I lead in the future, I'll never forget the feeling of battle—the feeling of being alive.",
  "str_voice_1501711_7": "I have full confidence in my luck, since I always get to see you around.",
  "str_voice_1501711_8": "You can... sense my trust in you? Fantastic.",
  "str_voice_1501711_9": "A chocolate bar... for me? You DO remember that I swore off that stuff, right? Thanks, anyway!",
  "str_voice_1501761_1": "If only I could be like Mr. John and lead an expert medical team that helps people all across Astra. There are still so many people suffering in the world that need treatment!",
  "str_voice_1501761_10": "Off to get some rest? Great, then I'll go study some of my medical textbooks. My time is very precious to me, so I have to make every second count!",
  "str_voice_1501761_11": "Does someone need medical attention here?! What's that? You just need me to stand here? I guess... But how is this supposed to improve my skills as a doctor?",
  "str_voice_1501761_12": "Make sure to attend routine medical check-ups! The sooner you discover a health problem, the easier it is to treat!",
  "str_voice_1501761_13": "What on earth made Lady Raphael believe she could repair those damaged Fireflies with her Holy Water Shell...? Sorry, I'll go clean them up right away.",
  "str_voice_1501761_14": "Our next battle will go even smoother, since I'm always improving myself!",
  "str_voice_1501761_15": "Happy birthday! Please accept this pack of medical supplies; you never know when you'll need to administer first-aid!",
  "str_voice_1501761_16": "Always be aware of your body's state of wellness. It's the only one you've got, after all!",
  "str_voice_1501761_17": "Good morning! If you have any missions to do today, please bring me along. I know I can be of great use to the team!",
  "str_voice_1501761_18": "Good evening! You were busy all day too, huh? I've had my nose buried in my medical texts since the morning!",
  "str_voice_1501761_19": "It's getting late. You should get some rest soon. Me? I'm not tired at all! Besides, there's still time for me to practice my Luminatics!",
  "str_voice_1501761_2": "Combing Lady Raphael's hair always takes up so much time... Don't look at me like that! I never said I didn't enjoy it!",
  "str_voice_1501761_20": "Lumopolis is my hometown, as well as the source of all my medical expertise. It's a place that has always been supportive of me and my goals.",
  "str_voice_1501761_21": "The folks in Umbraton are something else. Every time I go there, the streets are filled with the bruised and bloody thanks to all the fighting!",
  "str_voice_1501761_22": "White Night up high!",
  "str_voice_1501761_23": "The best way to treat Eclipsites... is without mercy!",
  "str_voice_1501761_24": "Lady Raphael can seem a bit reckless sometimes, but I assure you that she's an excellent doctor!",
  "str_voice_1501761_25": "Lady Carleen must have gone through a lot to become as strong as she is now. She's a real fighter, isn't she?",
  "str_voice_1501761_26": "Feeding birds, watering plants, cleaning the room... These are just a few hobbies that Lady Raphael suggested I get into!",
  "str_voice_1501761_27": "I can't stand a boring, complacent life. It wears down one's ambitions and robs them of their motivation to improve themselves.",
  "str_voice_1501761_28": "The Colossus appears to be a living creature... Which means it can get sick or injured, just like the rest of us. When that happens, how do you go about treating it?",
  "str_voice_1501761_29": "I'm Beretta, the field medic, and I was ordered to provide support. Are you in charge of this Colossus? Is anyone injured? Take me to them, and I'll treat them right away!",
  "str_voice_1501761_3": "Even if a patient's chances of survival are slim, I refuse to give up on them! Just like those doctors who refused to give up on me.",
  "str_voice_1501761_30": "Any progress is fantastic news!",
  "str_voice_1501761_31": "Great, time to work even harder!",
  "str_voice_1501761_32": "Just leave everything to me!",
  "str_voice_1501761_33": "I'll be sure to reciprocate your faith in me.",
  "str_voice_1501761_34": "I'll do my best!",
  "str_voice_1501761_35": "Preparation complete!",
  "str_voice_1501761_36": "Medical equipment is sterilized and ready to use!",
  "str_voice_1501761_37": "Shine, Borealis Plume!",
  "str_voice_1501761_38": "All my hard work was for this moment!",
  "str_voice_1501761_39": "It's just a little poke, don't move!",
  "str_voice_1501761_4": "I want to rescue all of my patients from the pain of their illnesses. But to realize that goal, I have to keep working as hard as possible.",
  "str_voice_1501761_40": "This is a necessary part of your treatment!",
  "str_voice_1501761_41": "Alright, leave it to me!",
  "str_voice_1501761_42": "Yes! Victory!",
  "str_voice_1501761_43": "I'm not afraid of failure or anything... but it still hurts.",
  "str_voice_1501761_44": "I hope my combat skills and medical expertise can keep improving like this every day!",
  "str_voice_1501761_45": "Can I use this to improve my medical skills...?",
  "str_voice_1501761_46": "I love it! Thanks so much!",
  "str_voice_1501761_47": "This is definitely getting put to good use!",
  "str_voice_1501761_48": "You really know what I like, Navigator! Thanks a bunch!",
  "str_voice_1501761_49": "As a field medic, my job is not only to support my allies, but also to reduce any other combat-related risks as much as possible. In order to perform my duties to the best of my ability, I have to work nonstop and keep improving myself!",
  "str_voice_1501761_5": "Physical and Luminatics training are important for health, but you can't afford to neglect training your mind.",
  "str_voice_1501761_50": "I was seriously ill in the past, but a medical team led by Mr. John saved my life. The cross-shaped scar on my forehead isn't just a souvenir from that surgery; it's evidence of the skill and kindness of the doctors who rescued me.",
  "str_voice_1501761_51": "Even though I'm frequently dispatched to any place that needs my help, I voluntarily chose to take care of Lady Raphael. She's an extremely gifted doctor, and I know I can learn a lot just by being at her side.",
  "str_voice_1501761_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1501761_53": "Hey there!",
  "str_voice_1501761_54": "A new day should always start with morning exercises!",
  "str_voice_1501761_55": "Good afternoon! Did you have a nice, healthy lunch?",
  "str_voice_1501761_56": "Still awake, huh?",
  "str_voice_1501761_57": "Happy New Year! I took half a day off to ring in the new year! Why just half a day? So I could use the other half to catch up on all my training for the day, of course!",
  "str_voice_1501761_6": "I've worked so hard all this time in anticipation of a chance like this, to realize my full potential! Thank you for believing in me; I won't let you down!",
  "str_voice_1501761_7": "Now that we're friends, I also have a responsibility to ensure that you're always in good health! If you're ever feeling under the weather, don't hesitate to tell me, okay?",
  "str_voice_1501761_8": "\"Balance work and rest,\" you say? Sigh... Even though I constantly tell others the same, I sometimes have difficulty following my own advice. Thanks for the reminder. I'll try to make more time for rest.",
  "str_voice_1501761_9": "So I got plenty of rest, just like you suggested... and now my work efficiency is through the roof! This works way better than pulling all-nighters, so thanks for the tip!",
  "str_voice_1501801_1": "Gathering info is very important. My hatted sparrow Blanche is responsible for Lumopolis, my gray pigeon Cinder is responsible for Lower Lumopolis, and my rat Shadow is responsible for Umbraton.",
  "str_voice_1501801_10": "I will write down everything you do within my sight. Are you afraid? Ahahaha—Nope, I wasn't laughing.",
  "str_voice_1501801_11": "Alright, this is a rare opportunity! No one to bother me, and my editor's not breathing down my neck about deadlines... It's time to finish all my work from last week!",
  "str_voice_1501801_12": "A first-class reporter never wavers for a second, even in the middle of a war zone.",
  "str_voice_1501801_13": "Are you curious about my bag? There are all kinds of precious leads and resources in it—priceless treasures a journalist should be proud of. Huh? You're just curious about the way it looks!?",
  "str_voice_1501801_14": "Listen, when you're chasing a lead and your cover's about to be blown, just do what I do—lower the brim of your hat, put on some sunglasses, and button up your coat.",
  "str_voice_1501801_15": "Happy birthday! You must be really happy today, right? What gifts have you received, and from whom?",
  "str_voice_1501801_16": "Was that interviewee telling the truth? Have I checked all the facts? Oh! Hi, I'm working hard, as always!",
  "str_voice_1501801_17": "My birds go out to eat bread crumbs in the street every morning. But why do they always choose this street? This needs investigating...",
  "str_voice_1501801_18": "Good evening. I'm preparing for tomorrow's shoot. Film: check, lens cover: check, flashbulb: check...",
  "str_voice_1501801_19": "I don't think you'd ever struggle with something like failing to pass a probationary period, would you? Well, you should get some rest, anyway.",
  "str_voice_1501801_2": "You think my gear looks heavy? Ah, thank you, but I can take care of it myself. If you want to be an independent reporter, these are all indispensable allies in the field.",
  "str_voice_1501801_20": "Umbraton has something to satisfy all appetites, whether it's social issues you're into or other matters of Aurorian interest.",
  "str_voice_1501801_21": "Lumopolis... I don't know if they even have reporters there.",
  "str_voice_1501801_22": "Blanche, Cinder, and Shadow are watching you!",
  "str_voice_1501801_23": "They don't seem particularly newsworthy.",
  "str_voice_1501801_24": "Vic is someone I really want to interview... One day I shall!",
  "str_voice_1501801_25": "Lilica is just like me! We're both striving to pursue our dreams.",
  "str_voice_1501801_26": "Is it true that Vice and Carleen had inclinations towards different things back when they were in school? Hmph. Fine, I'll stop asking.",
  "str_voice_1501801_27": "I really don't understand what those leaders are thinking... They seem to live in a completely alternate world separate from reality, and they feed the younger generation nothing but lies!",
  "str_voice_1501801_28": "Can Soroz only communicate with you? Oh... Could you do me a favor? You see, I want you to help interpret for us so I can interview it. How'd you know I was gonna ask?",
  "str_voice_1501801_29": "I'm Brandy, an intern reporter from The Daily Scoop. You're PlayerName? Great, I finally get to meet you! You're the biggest treasure trove of news headlines in all of Astra!",
  "str_voice_1501801_3": "I know what you meant just now—you don't like it here, do you? You have a lot of ideas yet to be realized, right? Huh? Are you denying it? Really? I don't believe you.",
  "str_voice_1501801_30": "I can write even faster now!",

  "str_voice_1501801_39": "Camera at the ready!",
  "str_voice_1501801_4": "Wow, I feel like my bag's gotten lighter all of a sudden! This should make things a lot easier... Thank you, PlayerName.",
  "str_voice_1501801_40": "ACTION!",
  "str_voice_1501801_41": "I've got this.",
  "str_voice_1501801_42": "Haha, I knew it!",

  "str_voice_1501801_50": "War made me realize that there's more to life than gossip. Even I don't know how I would truly define news... Can tragedies that repeat themselves every day really be called so?",
  "str_voice_1501801_51": "My parents want me to learn a trade, but I think interviewing and writing are skills I'll be honing all my life. Hmm... It really would be better if I could become a full-time employee at my current job, though.",

  "str_voice_1501931_26": "I like square-shaped things—they can be stacked so neatly, and this sensation is incredibly soothing!",
  "str_voice_1501931_27": "Criminals are the most disgusting beings in the world, and that's why I wish to act in the name of justice.",

  "str_voice_1501931_56": "Today's work is finally over!",

  "str_voice_1501931_9": "I have great love and respect for my parents, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to live the life they arranged for me. At least for now, I have yet to regret my choice.",
  "str_voice_1502001_1": "All living things carry a wealth of information about themselves. With sufficient intelligence, one can analyze a creature's behavioral patterns and motivations and even make predictions to a certain extent.",
  "str_voice_1502001_10": "Aren't you resting yet, PlayerName? Well then, let me use this free time to organize the intelligence I just collected.",
  "str_voice_1502001_11": "You seek my assistance... I don't have much experience, but if you could provide me with some detailed information regarding this task, I'll definitely try my best.",
  "str_voice_1502001_12": "This is my pet fish, Bubble, which I found in the swamp near the Dark Zone. You can touch it if you want. Rest assured, it's just an ordinary creature and isn't at all dangerous.",
  "str_voice_1502001_13": "Please don't tamper with my notebook. It's not only a tool for recording intelligence, but also a weapon.",
  "str_voice_1502001_14": "Every action leaves a trace. No matter how you try to cover it up, intelligence doesn't disappear into thin air. A bit of careful observation, and it all comes to light.",

  "str_voice_1502001_16": "Welcome back. The intelligence has been organized and the work schedule has been arranged. Please take a look.",
  "str_voice_1502001_17": "Good morning. It seems that you are someone who cannot live without work.",
  "str_voice_1502001_18": "Good evening. It's almost break time, so there's no need to force yourself to keep working, and there's no reason why you shouldn't relax now and then.",
  "str_voice_1502001_19": "It's so late... Haven't you gone to bed yet?",
  "str_voice_1502001_2": "Huh... Hmm? Did you call me? No, I wasn't sleeping, I was just observing you and the others on this Colossus.",
  "str_voice_1502001_20": "The Illumina Federation is a place that exists for the happiness of all. At least that's what I believe.",
  "str_voice_1502001_21": "Northland is also close to the Dark Zone, but it has mountains and the Beacon protecting it. Such peace and comfort are truly enviable.",
  "str_voice_1502001_22": "Splendor Illumina.",
  "str_voice_1502001_23": "No matter where you may find yourself, Eclipsites are creatures that bring trouble and danger. Please be careful.",
  "str_voice_1502001_24": "The Grand Marshal is a reliable leader. This is the conclusion I have drawn after careful observation.",
  "str_voice_1502001_25": "I occasionally find myself compelled to complain to Commander Barton. I wish he would calm down a little more.",
  "str_voice_1502001_26": "I like raising fish—is that surprising to you? See, this is what happens when you lack intel.",
  "str_voice_1502001_27": "Blind faith is not a good thing. It can affect a commander's decisions.",
  "str_voice_1502001_28": "Intelligence on Colossi in Illumina is scarce... Will you allow me to take a look around?",
  "str_voice_1502001_29": "A Caelestite, flying a Colossus... you're indeed the one. Anatoli, Intelligence Officer of the Illumina Federation, happy to assist you. Please give your orders.",
  "str_voice_1502001_3": "Caelestites possess the psychic ability that Aurorians do not. The ability is not only useful in combat, but also seems to provide significant advantages in gathering intelligence.",
  "str_voice_1502001_30": "Accumulating combat experience is also a way of gathering intelligence.",
  "str_voice_1502001_31": "Intelligence accuracy upgraded.",
  "str_voice_1502001_32": "A new combat plan has been drawn up.",
  "str_voice_1502001_33": "The plan is ready for execution.",
  "str_voice_1502001_34": "Understood.",
  "str_voice_1502001_35": "New tactics planned successfully.",
  "str_voice_1502001_36": "Ready when you are.",
  "str_voice_1502001_37": "Disrupt the enemy's formation.",
  "str_voice_1502001_38": "Latent glow, lurking in the shadows.",
  "str_voice_1502001_39": "Weak point located.",
  "str_voice_1502001_4": "Don't let existing knowledge mislead you—as an intelligence officer, I rarely participate in combat, but that doesn't mean I'm not good at it.",
  "str_voice_1502001_40": "Now's our chance.",
  "str_voice_1502001_41": "As you command.",
  "str_voice_1502001_42": "An inevitable victory.",
  "str_voice_1502001_43": "Our intelligence is flawed... Retreat for now.",
  "str_voice_1502001_44": "Don't worry about me, I'm just observing the others and gathering intelligence.",
  "str_voice_1502001_45": "Thanks for the gift.",
  "str_voice_1502001_46": "Have you... specifically studied my preferences?",
  "str_voice_1502001_47": "When you choose gifts for others, the items you pick also reflect your own taste and preferences.",
  "str_voice_1502001_48": "Thank you, I really like this gift.",
  "str_voice_1502001_49": "No one is born an intelligence officer. I started as a scout, accumulating experience and honing myself until I eventually became who I am today.",
  "str_voice_1502001_5": "An intelligence officer should aim to avoid unnecessary battles whenever possible, but if it is your command, I won't refuse.",
  "str_voice_1502001_50": "Raising a pet fish is a time-consuming task that requires regular feeding, cleaning green algae from the tank, and paying constant attention to the health of the fish... However, Bubble has always been very healthy, perhaps because it lived in the Eternal Night before.",
  "str_voice_1502001_51": "Trusting someone means you're willing to entrust your safety and even your life to another person. It doesn't matter whether you're an ordinary foot soldier or an intelligence officer.",
  "str_voice_1502001_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1502001_53": "Hello, PlayerName.",

  "str_voice_1502001_56": "It's getting dark...",
  "str_voice_1502001_57": "Happy New Year, PlayerName. In the new year, please allow me to collect intelligence for you and provide assistance on the Colossus.",
  "str_voice_1502001_6": "I presume you are aware of my abilities and limitations... So, please give me any orders you see fit, and I will bring you the intelligence that will lead us to victory.",
  "str_voice_1502001_7": "Hearsay cannot be used as intelligence. Information needs to be verified... For example, I only began to understand what kind of person you were after getting to know you.",
  "str_voice_1502001_8": "On the battlefield, neither weapons nor intel are more important than trust. In the past, as a scout, I acted alone and didn't understand the meaning of trust, but now, things are different.",
  "str_voice_1502001_9": "Do you want to see my notebook? Um... You can only look at the parts that do not involve Illumina's confidential information, and you cannot disclose the content of my notes to outsiders. You're not allowed to doodle on it, either.",
  "str_voice_1502031_1": "Based on your responses to the divination, I'm sure you're someone who'd laugh when happy, sleep when tired, and whose stomach growls when hungry! What? You mean everybody's like that?",
  "str_voice_1502031_10": "Your reading was unsuccessful last time, so I've decided to give you a free reading this time. What, you don't want it? But it'll work this time for sure!",
  "str_voice_1502031_11": "Hi, I'm here to hang out! I'll tell you a story if you're in a bad mood!",
  "str_voice_1502031_12": "I just had a super-yummy fruit salad in the Cafe. Red strawberries, orange tangerines, yellow pineapple... It was like a painter's palette!",
  "str_voice_1502031_13": "Did you lose a pen? Let me do divination... Uh, it should be in the cabinet to the southwest! What, still can't find it?",
  "str_voice_1502031_14": "What were those colorful things we saw in the market last time again? Oh, right, balloons. They were so pretty.",
  "str_voice_1502031_15": "Wow, it's your birthday! Let's throw a super huge party!",
  "str_voice_1502031_16": "Anything interesting happened to you today? Be sure to let me know!",
  "str_voice_1502031_17": "Good morning! Got important tasks for the day? Let me do a reading for you!",
  "str_voice_1502031_18": "Hey, it's dark out. Let's go check out the scenery at night.",
  "str_voice_1502031_19": "My divination book pointed out that spirits were more active in the evening, so I decided to stay up all night!",
  "str_voice_1502031_2": "The color scheme is kind of plain on the Colossus. How about we paint some colorful patterns? Why not? It's not graffiti, I promise!",
  "str_voice_1502031_20": "Northland might be a little cold, but it's dreamy, like a fairy tale.",
  "str_voice_1502031_21": "Lumopolis is pretty, but it feels stuffy too, like a boring textbook.",
  "str_voice_1502031_22": "For the North.",
  "str_voice_1502031_23": "Come on, we've got to do a reading on how to avoid Eclipsites altogether.",
  "str_voice_1502031_24": "Miss Jeriah is super cool, tolerant, and powerful. What can I do to be like her?",
  "str_voice_1502031_25": "Queen Bethlehem is so impressive and beautiful. I can't look away every time I see her.",
  "str_voice_1502031_26": "I've made up several new exciting tales. Wanna hear?",
  "str_voice_1502031_27": "Why would people ghost me? That's annoying. I'd never ghost anyone unless I got the time wrong... heehee.",
  "str_voice_1502031_28": "If only the Colossus was bigger to hold everybody, we'd have real parties!",
  "str_voice_1502031_29": "The crystal ball glows as the enigmatic Jakine, the Divination Master, makes her entrance. What will become of the encounter? Stay tuned!",
  "str_voice_1502031_3": "Hey, whacha doing? What's that, my loud voice freaked you out? How come? Were you doing something in secret? Heehee, I won't tell!",
  "str_voice_1502031_30": "Hiyah!",
  "str_voice_1502031_31": "I'm great!",

  "str_voice_1502031_38": "Got it covered!",
  "str_voice_1502031_39": "Prophecy fulfilled.",
  "str_voice_1502031_4": "You look tired, did you have a rough night? How about I tell you a story? \"The Mysterious Cave That Swallows People Whole\" should perk you up in a jiffy!",
  "str_voice_1502031_40": "Sense the future.",
  "str_voice_1502031_41": "I got this!",
  "str_voice_1502031_42": "Successful divination!",
  "str_voice_1502031_43": "The divination failed...",
  "str_voice_1502031_44": "The divination is more accurate the closer I am to the sky, right?",
  "str_voice_1502031_45": "Ooh! Thanks!",
  "str_voice_1502031_46": "Wow, this gift is awesome!",
  "str_voice_1502031_47": "All right, another present!",
  "str_voice_1502031_48": "Awesome! I love it!",
  "str_voice_1502031_49": "My mom was a master of divination too, and she's awesome sauce! This, uh, divination book... She left me with this.",
  "str_voice_1502031_5": "To be as tolerant as Jeriah, as powerful as Bethlehem, as smart as Mother—that's a piece of cake!",
  "str_voice_1502031_50": "Miss Jeriah is my teacher. See, doesn't Whisper look like a dead ringer for Miss Jeriah's Sacred Python? It doesn't...?",
  "str_voice_1502031_51": "Places I like to go? Before, it was Lake Mirror, Northland Pine, and World's Spine... They're not crowded, but I can explore the secrets of Luminatics there.",
  "str_voice_1502031_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1502031_53": "Hi!",
  "str_voice_1502031_54": "Good morning!",

  "str_voice_1502031_56": "Come on, time to sleep.",
  "str_voice_1502031_57": "It's the liveliest, happiest time of the year again. Let's dance and laugh with joy!",
  "str_voice_1502031_6": "What game are you playing? Is it hard? I wanna try. It should be no problem with the two of us!",
  "str_voice_1502031_7": "The market is gonna be very packed this weekend with lots of stuff. I really wanna go! Let's go when you're free!",
  "str_voice_1502031_8": "Somebody invited me to a get-together yesterday, but I didn't go because you weren't gonna be there. While I like the idea of partying, it's not fun without you.",
  "str_voice_1502031_9": "I've been very busy making a dreamcatcher lately. Supposedly, it can catch sweet dreams. I used a lot of threads of different colors too! I'll give it to you when I'm done!",

  "str_voice_1502131_54": "Good morning. Would you like to know the time?",
  "str_voice_1502131_55": "Good afternoon. I have updated some of your recipes.",
  "str_voice_1502131_56": "Good night. Now preparing a lullaby.",
  "str_voice_1502131_57": "The calendar in my database has long expired, but I'm willing to adapt to a new one, and to learn more about this world with you.",
  "str_voice_1502131_6": "The duration of my mission far exceeds the understanding of ordinary Aurorians, and likewise, the body that has served this mission has witnessed many Aurorian lifetimes. And in the future... it shall continue to do so.",
  "str_voice_1502131_7": "You seem very interested in my external appearance. In truth, this is only my default build; I can select from many other builds depending on my environment and circumstances.",
  "str_voice_1502131_8": "When I decided to join you aboard the Colossus, I had my reservations. More specifically, I was unsure whether or not other Aurorians would accept my external appearance.",
  "str_voice_1502131_9": "Thank you for helping me clean my outer surface. In exchange, allow me to clean yours, as well... Is something the matter?",
  "str_voice_1502151_1": "Rebec—Oh, it's you. What is it? If you're going to ask for help with collecting debts... Huh, that's not why you're here? So what exactly do you want?",
  "str_voice_1502151_10": "She's avoiding me again... What could I be doing wrong? Am I not putting enough heart into this?\nOr maybe I just have to catch her off-guard...",
  "str_voice_1502151_11": "Alright, point me to the sad loser who owes you money!\nWhat? Nobody owes you anything? Why didn't you say so earlier?!",
  "str_voice_1502151_12": "I'm itching for a fight.\nOh hey, you came at just the right time!\nDon't worry, I just want to practice my extortion techniques, nothing dangerous or—Hey, get back here!",
  "str_voice_1502151_13": "Why haven't I given up on being a debt collector?\nGood question! Obviously, it's because I want Rebecca to live a good life! She's already been through so much... As her older sister, this is the least I can do.",
  "str_voice_1502151_14": "You'll pay me to work as your bodyguard or secretary, right? Hey, don't look at me like that! I'm not trying to take advantage of you or anything, but I still gotta feed Rebecca you know! I'll even accept lower pay... Come on, it's a good deal!",
  "str_voice_1502151_15": "... I've long forgotten what I'm supposed to do for birthdays, but just let me know if you want anything!",
  "str_voice_1502151_16": "Yahoo! How's your work coming along? Mine's going just fine, as I expected!",
  "str_voice_1502151_17": "You're up super early! Since we're here, why don't you come with me to see Rebecca?",
  "str_voice_1502151_18": "Wow, you didn't skip dinner, did you? Here, have some of mine.",
  "str_voice_1502151_19": "Heheh, some jobs can only be done at this hour. Trust me, I know all about it!",
  "str_voice_1502151_2": "First of all, I'm not the type to value money more than anything else. Second, you need to pay my full deposit if you want to hire me for a job. But for you, I'll drop my rate by 20 percent.",
  "str_voice_1502151_20": "There needs to be a little chaos in the world, that's how someone like me gets work—Hey, that makes me sound like a villain.",
  "str_voice_1502151_21": "They say Lumopolis is the safest place in the world. I'm thinking of finding Rebecca a place to live over there.",
  "str_voice_1502151_22": "Rebecca's number one in the world! No contest!",
  "str_voice_1502151_23": "If repaying debts is a natural part of our world, then so is killing Eclipsites.",
  "str_voice_1502151_24": "Even though Sheol likes to act as if she knows everything, I feel like one of these days she's gonna lose big time.",
  "str_voice_1502151_25": "Looks like Rebecca is still having a hard time letting herself go. Seriously, there's no need to be so shy!",
  "str_voice_1502151_26": "Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca! Heeheehee...",
  "str_voice_1502151_27": "The only thing in the world I couldn't possibly bear is being disliked by Rebecca.",
  "str_voice_1502151_28": "Think I could borrow the Colossus for a bit? Collecting debts would be a lot easier with this big guy around!",
  "str_voice_1502151_29": "Hey! The name's Isa, and I'm a professional debt collector as well as Rebecca's medical assistant. I can help you handle any debts swiftly and easily. As long as you're the creditor, of course.",
  "str_voice_1502151_3": "My story before I reunited with Rebecca? You're a real busybody, aren't you? I don't care to remember any of that stuff.",
  "str_voice_1502151_30": "Ohhh, I feel great!",
  "str_voice_1502151_31": "I can take on more work now.",
  "str_voice_1502151_32": "To a full and happy life!",
  "str_voice_1502151_33": "I won't be mistaken as the younger sister anymore!",
  "str_voice_1502151_34": "Time for work.",
  "str_voice_1502151_35": "Ready for a lesson?",
  "str_voice_1502151_36": "Where to begin?",
  "str_voice_1502151_37": "Let's start from here!",
  "str_voice_1502151_38": "Wanna try this out?",
  "str_voice_1502151_39": "What's your answer?",
  "str_voice_1502151_4": "I don't mind work, because work brings money. You can't tell Rebecca about the work I'm taking under the table! I'm begging you!",
  "str_voice_1502151_40": "Just cooperate!",
  "str_voice_1502151_41": "Hi, now pay up.",
  "str_voice_1502151_42": "Another debt collected!",
  "str_voice_1502151_43": "Oof! I forgot the interest!",
  "str_voice_1502151_44": "Break time! Nothing like a picture of Rebecca to keep me going!\n... Aaaah—!!",
  "str_voice_1502151_45": "So, who owes you money?",
  "str_voice_1502151_46": "For me? Thanks!",
  "str_voice_1502151_47": "Wow... I won't say no to that!",
  "str_voice_1502151_48": "Ohhh! You really get me, you know!",
  "str_voice_1502151_49": "Rebecca and I are living proof that people can truly be influenced by their surroundings. Even so, I think the deepest parts of our souls will always be the same no matter what.\nWhat do you think?",
  "str_voice_1502151_5": "If you're having trouble with something, feel free to come find me. I may not be able to help, but at least I can listen to your complaints.",
  "str_voice_1502151_50": "I'm not really fit to be an older sister. I know that better than anyone, but I really don't want to admit it.\nIt's unacceptable! How could I possibly lose to that person?",
  "str_voice_1502151_51": "Thanks to you, I didn't make the same mistakes as before. Thank you for never giving up, and for saving Rebecca.\n... Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1502151_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1502151_53": "Hello!",
  "str_voice_1502151_54": "You awake yet?",
  "str_voice_1502151_55": "A little laziness never hurt!",
  "str_voice_1502151_56": "I'm still up. What about you?",
  "str_voice_1502151_57": "Happy New Year! Forget all about work today and just have fun! I made some tea and rice cakes, so let's go hang out with Rebecca!",
  "str_voice_1502151_6": "No one messes with Rebecca as long as I'm around! She needs peace and quiet to recover right now, so if you have anything to say to her, you'll have to go through me first!",
  "str_voice_1502151_7": "You want to know about Rebecca's childhood? Ha, good luck getting anything out of me! But if you happen to know some of her secrets... I might be interested in a little trade.",
  "str_voice_1502151_8": "I want to become a worthy older sister—not to make up for anything, but just because.\nOne day, I want to hear Rebecca call me her sister again and mean it.",
  "str_voice_1502151_9": "Anyway, if you happen to ACCIDENTALLY snap a picture of Rebecca, I'll pay you a fortune for it! Catch my drift? Oh, and one more thing: don't you dare tell her about any of this!",
  "str_voice_1502201_1": "Uwaah! W-W-Where did you come from?! P-P-Please stand at least twenty meters away when I'm busy with my work, and don't forget to cough, clear your throat, or stomp around when you show up!",
  "str_voice_1502201_10": "There's no way you're asleep right now, right? Didn't you already sleep once yesterday?",
  "str_voice_1502201_11": "It's so bright here, I think I'm gonna melt away... Huh? You need me to watch the door for you? S-Sure! I'll pick out any \"phonies\" who show up pretending to be good people... or at least I'll try.",
  "str_voice_1502201_12": "Wow, are you serious? The Academy of Arts wants to add me to their list of registered appraisers, and they need me to offer my expert opinion in court?! N-N-No way, I can't do it unless... unless you go with me! I'm sorry, is that asking too much from you?",
  "str_voice_1502201_13": "You want to help me move some antiques around? Thanks! Oh, is that one too heavy for you? Don't worry, I'll take care of it! Y-You need to eat a little more sugar to get stronger.",
  "str_voice_1502201_14": "*sniffling* I only ate thirty-seven snacks today. I'm so hungry that my head's starting to spin. I don't think I can hold on much longer...",
  "str_voice_1502201_15": "Happy birthday! Y-You don't have to invite me to your birthday party, but I wouldn't mind if you delivered a slice of cake to my room... W-Would that be okay?",
  "str_voice_1502201_16": "Hiya! I tend to lose my nerve when there are lots of people walking around, but you never seem bothered by it. What's your secret?",
  "str_voice_1502201_17": "Good evening... Huh? It's morning already? Eheheh, time really flies when I'm working next to you, since I feel so at ease.",
  "str_voice_1502201_18": "It's already night? Don't worry, I can still keep working... Wanna stay up with me too?",
  "str_voice_1502201_19": "I'm still not tired, but you should definitely go to sleep soon. What's that? I won't get taller if I don't get enough sleep? Oh, so that's why I'm so...",
  "str_voice_1502201_2": "Um, could I try a bite of this cake first? Just a little bite... Wow! This plate's pattern is just like what I read in those books about Caelestites! Where'd I put my magnifying glass?!",
  "str_voice_1502201_20": "Umbraton's history is really complicated. There are so many stories layered on top of each other, just like an ancient dig site... I-It's actually kind of my thing.",
  "str_voice_1502201_21": "I bet lots of counterfeit items make their way into Lumopolis! And that's because... the appraisers there aren't very skilled, and their customers only pretend to care about art.",
  "str_voice_1502201_22": "The shadow is watching you... and as an appraiser, so am I!",
  "str_voice_1502201_23": "Eclipsites aren't real living creatures, but replicas of some sort... Uwaah, n-no, I don't really have any proof to back up my opinion. C-Call it intuition, I guess...",
  "str_voice_1502201_24": "Hey! Come and meet my newest friend, all the way from Longzhou! Just look at this jewel-like paint... Huh? \"Just a sandalwood chair\"? Of course it is, so what?",
  "str_voice_1502201_25": "Allura's the best collector in all of Umbraton. She has impeccable taste and a perfect eye for quality, so there's no way anything in her collection is fake!",
  "str_voice_1502201_26": "The Museum has a new treasure on display?! Awesome! When can we go see it? Tomorrow? Or maybe... Let's go see it today!",
  "str_voice_1502201_27": "I-I-I talked to three different people today, so I don't have any more energy to socialize!",
  "str_voice_1502201_28": "Colossi are the epitome of Caelestite civilization! Its form, its color, and its patterns... You just have to let me stay here and study it!",
  "str_voice_1502201_29": "N-N-Nice to meet you. My name is Vergil, and I like antiques. Well, goodbye... Wait, those clothes are from Eraveil! You must be the Caelestite that came out of the ground a while ago!",
  "str_voice_1502201_3": "\"Appraising antiques is a mentally strenuous task. As a result, the appraiser must consume even more food than the people producing counterfeit items!\" That's straight from a book titled \"Introduction to Appraisal.\" Huh? How'd you know I was the one who wrote it?",
  "str_voice_1502201_30": "Uncover the full truth!",
  "str_voice_1502201_31": "I can see more clearly now.",
  "str_voice_1502201_32": "Ancient wisdom is always with me.",
  "str_voice_1502201_33": "No falsehoods can deceive me!",
  "str_voice_1502201_34": "Ahh! So many people!",
  "str_voice_1502201_35": "Sugar levels replenished!",
  "str_voice_1502201_36": "L-Let me take a closer look.",
  "str_voice_1502201_37": "No forgeries will ever get past me...!",
  "str_voice_1502201_38": "I've detected at least seven flaws.",
  "str_voice_1502201_39": "Show your true colors!",
  "str_voice_1502201_4": "Wow! Has my Lumina gotten that much stronger? That was close, good thing I didn't damage any of my ancient paintings!",
  "str_voice_1502201_40": "Nothing escapes my sight.",
  "str_voice_1502201_41": "Should I really be leading this many people?",
  "str_voice_1502201_42": "Nothing but defective goods here.",
  "str_voice_1502201_43": "My power... wasn't the real deal?",
  "str_voice_1502201_44": "You mean... I can study the Colossus whenever I want?! A-Am I dreaming?!",
  "str_voice_1502201_45": "A gift? I thought you wanted me to appraise something...",
  "str_voice_1502201_46": "Wow... This is going with my most prized antiques!",
  "str_voice_1502201_47": "Thanks! Guess antiques aren't the only nice things in the world!",
  "str_voice_1502201_48": "Wow! You really know what I like now!",
  "str_voice_1502201_49": "I-I'm really not some \"genius appraiser\" or anything. Back when I didn't understand these things, I just spent most of my days looking at old paintings and antiques. After a while, I naturally learned how to tell them apart.",
  "str_voice_1502201_5": "Power... I feel so much power welling up inside me! I bet I could even walk into a room full of people now! Wait... Never mind, I'm probably just imagining things.",
  "str_voice_1502201_50": "Why am I working at such a young age? Well, to tell you the truth, it's because I can't bear to lose my antique \"friends\"...",
  "str_voice_1502201_51": "Some of the people making forgeries are even better at painting than the original artists. Their bold themes, the wonderful blending of colors, and the complex emotions they evoke... Oh! S-S-Sorry, I started rambling again.",
  "str_voice_1502201_52": "A-Alchemy Stars...!",
  "str_voice_1502201_53": "PlayerName!",
  "str_voice_1502201_54": "Uwaah, morning again...",
  "str_voice_1502201_55": "Good afternoon! T-That's all.",
  "str_voice_1502201_56": "Good evening!",
  "str_voice_1502201_57": "Oh, is it a new year already? Happy New Year! Wait... New Year's celebrations usually have lots of people, don't they? B-But if you're there, I think I can handle it! Let's go...!",
  "str_voice_1502201_6": "You think I've gotten stronger too, don't you PlayerName? I knew eating all that sugar wouldn't hurt me! Here, I'll even give you a third of my snacks... Or maybe just a fourth? You don't mind, do you?",
  "str_voice_1502201_7": "A sugarpine frame with an adjustable latch, crafted in the ancient Gannon style. It's perfect... Huh? Ahhh! I-I-It's nothing, I was just looking for a nice frame to go with your portrait! What's that? You've never had a portrait done before? I-I can introduce you to a good artist, if you want!",
  "str_voice_1502201_8": "You always come to play with me, PlayerName... What? I-I-I could never find you annoying! I'm always happy to see you, and you're welcome to play with me anytime... N-Not that you have to or anything! It's fine if you don't have time for me...",
  "str_voice_1502201_9": "I was always so scared of strangers before I met you... Sometimes I like to think that if I had a big brother, he would be just like you...",
  "str_voice_1502241_1": "If you run into any troublesome fiendlings on your travels around Longzhou, just let me know, and I'll take care of them for you.",
  "str_voice_1502241_10": "Sorry, did Ah Ding and the others disturb you? I'll just tell those little creatures to keep quiet.",
  "str_voice_1502241_11": "Is there anything I can help you with...? You just wanted to pet the fiendlings? Go ahead, they don't bite... They're just a little hot to the touch.",
  "str_voice_1502241_12": "So, you don't have anything like the fiendlings on your continent, just some strange beasts that can use energy spells and Aurorians with animal heads who can't really use energy spells all that well... If I ever get the chance, I'd love to see them.",
  "str_voice_1502241_13": "Storybooks often speak of fiendlings training to \"transcend the apex.\" There's actually some truth to this—\"transcending the apex\" refers to a fiendling learning to control its abilities without destroying itself in the process.",
  "str_voice_1502241_14": "I once read that education knows no class, and my master also taught me that all living beings are equal. I agree with this principle—whether it's a high-ranking official or a little fiendling, the virtuous should be rewarded, and the wicked should be punished.",
  "str_voice_1502241_15": "Here's a little birthday gift I prepared for you! These other gifts? Ah Ding and the others gathered them up for you. Just remember not to eat them raw.",
  "str_voice_1502241_16": "Just look at that perfect sky, with the sun shining so brightly! Any mischievous fiendling hoping to cause trouble would be very unlikely to strike at a time like this.",
  "str_voice_1502241_17": "Morning! Moving some supplies, are you? I can help out. Ah Ding and the others can also carry a bit too.",
  "str_voice_1502241_18": "You're more likely to run into wicked spirits after sunset than during the daytime.",
  "str_voice_1502241_19": "Fiendlings that have yet to ascend to Aurorian form usually act according to instinct, thus the dead of night is when many of them are most active.",
  "str_voice_1502241_2": "You need to make sure you keep an eye out for con artists looking for an easy mark. You know the ones I mean—the kind that talk about fate, yin and yang, good luck and all that, but who don't do a thing for you... Who am I talking about? Well, no one in particular.",
  "str_voice_1502241_20": "Longzhou is a land of towering peaks and vast oceans, and is home to more fiendlings than you could count in a single lifetime.",
  "str_voice_1502241_21": "I've heard that species with fiendling-like features are not an uncommon sight on your continent... Is this really the case?",
  "str_voice_1502241_22": "Eliminating demons and exorcising wicked spirits. This is where my talent lies.",
  "str_voice_1502241_23": "Fiendlings are even more sensitive to the auras of wicked spirits than Aurorians. They have to be, otherwise they might end up wicked spirit fodder.",
  "str_voice_1502241_24": "Once Ah Ding finally masters his Iron Head-Butt, I'll need to start considering what to teach him next...",
  "str_voice_1502241_25": "You can tell right away that a fiendling as cultured as Liqing must have been taught by a master of considerable talent.",
  "str_voice_1502241_26": "Would you like some water chestnuts, friend?",
  "str_voice_1502241_27": "A rich man once insisted that I help his cat transcend the apex. I told him his cat was just a cat, not a fiendling, but he didn't listen.",
  "str_voice_1502241_28": "I have traveled far and wide and seen many strange things, but I've never seen anything like this before.",
  "str_voice_1502241_29": "Luo Song, at your service—a wandering priest from the mountains, and a trained fiendling whisperer. This here is Ah Ding, and these are his fellow fiendling companions.",
  "str_voice_1502241_3": "You'll hear the most outlandish stories about fiendlings out in rural Longzhou. I reckon most of them are nonsense, though. Most fiendlings have better things to do than some of the shenanigans people accuse them of.",
  "str_voice_1502241_30": "Strengthening your body should always be your top priority.",
  "str_voice_1502241_31": "If the robe fits...",
  "str_voice_1502241_32": "It never hurts to pack a few extra talismans.",
  "str_voice_1502241_33": "You can never have too many holy talismans.",
  "str_voice_1502241_34": "Now, who's been causing trouble here?",
  "str_voice_1502241_35": "Now's my chance!",
  "str_voice_1502241_36": "Ah Ding, it's our time to shine.",
  "str_voice_1502241_37": "The heavens wait for no one! Wicked thing, be cleansed!",
  "str_voice_1502241_38": "Iron Head-Butt, ready to strike!",
  "str_voice_1502241_39": "Searing Head-Butt!",
  "str_voice_1502241_4": "This is Ah Ding, the little guy I usually throw out into battle. I have to throw him out, of course... How else is he gonna get to practice his headbutting?",
  "str_voice_1502241_40": "Ah Ding! Strike now!",
  "str_voice_1502241_41": "Shh. Observation is the key to victory.",
  "str_voice_1502241_42": "Nicely done! And there's still time for tea.",
  "str_voice_1502241_43": "Run! I'll hold them off.",
  "str_voice_1502241_44": "Ah Ding, you should know better than to poke your nose around someone else's home.",
  "str_voice_1502241_45": "Thank you very much. There's a chance this might come in handy.",
  "str_voice_1502241_46": "This may be of use... plus, Ah Ding really likes it.",
  "str_voice_1502241_47": "I'll gladly accept it, and I'll be sure to pay you back someday soon.",
  "str_voice_1502241_48": "Wow... Where did you find this beauty? We can't wait to hear all about it!",
  "str_voice_1502241_49": "I grew up in a temple. When I was a child, my parents assumed fiendling possession was the cause of my stunted stature, but that wasn't the case.",
  "str_voice_1502241_5": "Me? A trainer? I guess that's what you call it overseas. Sure, I like being a fiendling trainer. It's certainly easier than teaching Aurorians.",
  "str_voice_1502241_50": "The senior disciples up on the mountain didn't really teach me all that much. When given the choice between mastering paper talismans and honing my martial arts, I naturally chose martial arts.",
  "str_voice_1502241_51": "After descending the mountain, I made a living subduing fiendlings for whoever asked. It was around this time I met Ah Ding and taught him not to step on crops with those hot little paws of his, as well as a few other survival tips.",
  "str_voice_1502241_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1502241_53": "Here I am!",
  "str_voice_1502241_54": "Morning. Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_voice_1502241_55": "Thank you for putting up with Ah Ding.",
  "str_voice_1502241_56": "Until next time. Come find me whenever you're free.",
  "str_voice_1502241_57": "Happy New Year! No matter where you're from, or whether you're an Aurorian or not, doesn't it feel great to get together like this?",
  "str_voice_1502241_6": "A fiendling like Ah Ding needs to train for a long time to ascend to Aurorian form. How long? It's gonna be at least a few hundred years.",
  "str_voice_1502241_7": "Even if you don't have a knack for Luminatics, don't let that get you down. You're fit, healthy, fast on your feet, and quick with your hands. Keep up your training and you're sure to make something of yourself someday!",
  "str_voice_1502241_8": "I'm not really talented, but the martial arts techniques I've developed over the years are powerful!",

  "str_voice_1502281_1": "\"The Last Caelestite\"... What a cool title! Ah, if only it had been my idea...",
  "str_voice_1502281_10": "Booooring... I wanna go racing... No, maybe this is all part of a heroine's truest trial... I can't run away now.",
  "str_voice_1502281_11": "Huh? You want me to stay here and wait like a good little girl? Get real! I wanna race! You insist...? You're clingy, but whatever, I'll stay with you for a little bit, just a little bit though, okay?",
  "str_voice_1502281_12": "Hmm, toffee rice was one epic failure... That combination's just too bizarre... Maybe I should try fruity candy next time.",
  "str_voice_1502281_13": "Let me see... How about some caramel candy? No, no—how about milk candy instead!?",
  "str_voice_1502281_14": "You wanna know how eating so much candy hasn't rotted my teeth? Hahaha, that's 'cause I'm Rediesel Wrench's Sweet Reaper! I'd never overlook my oral hygiene!",
  "str_voice_1502281_15": "Happy Birthday! So where's the cake? The one with all the cream and strawberries!",
  "str_voice_1502281_16": "Today, just like yesterday, I'm gonna give it my all for the fate of the world!",
  "str_voice_1502281_17": "Good morning... Yaaaawn... I'm so sleepy. You don't have a problem if I catch another forty winks, right?",
  "str_voice_1502281_18": "The sun... has set, and now, those guys should start stirring, right? Huh? Who are those guys? Well... that doesn't matter—this is my battle, don't interfere!",
  "str_voice_1502281_19": "Good evening! You wanna know why I'm not sleeping? Because I'm all grown up, and I can decide if I ever want to go to sleep early again!",
  "str_voice_1502281_2": "Claudius, Ethelred, Patroclus... Hmm, I really do have such a fantastic taste for names. Oh? Isn't it normal to name the bombs?",
  "str_voice_1502281_20": "I grew up at the Rediesel Wrench so I get along with everyone just fine, except for that woman... Hmph! Right... every heroine needs a nemesis.",
  "str_voice_1502281_21": "Lumopolis? Ah... Of course I know it! I defeated an evil dragon there and saved a beautiful princess!",
  "str_voice_1502281_22": "Live life to the fullest! There's always time for candy!",
  "str_voice_1502281_23": "Don't worry, I'll protect everyone! After all, I took down three Eclipsites when I was only nine.",
  "str_voice_1502281_24": "Azure... She's clearly a minion of some evil overlord... Sooner or later, I'll unveil her true face!",
  "str_voice_1502281_25": "The kids at the Rediesel Wrench are all my underlings.",
  "str_voice_1502281_26": "Guarding the world's candy is my prime mission! Oh, zero-calorie candies and licorice are NOT included.",
  "str_voice_1502281_27": "Something I don't like...? Failure, I guess...? But it's all part and parcel of a heroine's trial!",
  "str_voice_1502281_28": "I'm so jealous... So, this is the Last Caelestite's ancient superweapon...",
  "str_voice_1502281_29": "Ah, guided by the hand of fate, we finally meet, legendary savior—thanks for everything. Here, have some candy!",
  "str_voice_1502281_3": "\"Life is all about speed and sweetness. That makes racing while eating candy the true essence of life.\" Pretty cool line, huh?",
  "str_voice_1502281_30": "Hmm, this feels quite nice.",

  "str_voice_1502281_37": "Take a bite of peach!",
  "str_voice_1502281_38": "Super sweet!",

  "str_voice_1502281_46": "You knew I needed this?",
  "str_voice_1502281_47": "We're all squad allies now—there's no need to be so formal!",
  "str_voice_1502281_48": "You too have been guided by fate, Caelestite.",
  "str_voice_1502281_49": "For as long as I can remember, Roy has taken care of me. To me, he's like a village chief to the warrior!",
  "str_voice_1502281_5": "Becoming a hero, is basically about friendship, hard work, victory, and, of course, the most important aspect—sugar. I think I fit all these perfectly.",

  "str_voice_1502281_56": "Huff... Sleepy.",
  "str_voice_1502281_57": "Happy New Year! Do you have any New Year's resolutions? I'll tell the master of fate all about them!",
  "str_voice_1502281_6": "\"At this moment, my right hand ignites. Ablaze, it roars, calling out for me to...\" What's the next bit? Oh no, how could I forget such a cool line!?",
  "str_voice_1502281_7": "You're not that bad. Put in a little more effort, and I might consider letting you join my warrior squad!",
  "str_voice_1502281_8": "I acknowledge your power, Last Caelestite. From today on, you're an official member of my squad, and as part of your initiation rite, you need to share that lollipop with me!",
  "str_voice_1502281_9": "Once all this is over, have you thought about what you'll do next? If you haven't planned anything yet, how about joining up with me... Oh no, I'd better not jinx myself!",
  "str_voice_1502321_1": "My mentor once asked what I'd been repenting for all these years. I replied: \"Everything—Being born. Existing. Talking. Thinking...\" This is the first time anyone has listened to me for a long time without leaving.",
  "str_voice_1502321_10": "Oh... I was so entranced by this outfit that I forgot you were there, sorry. So, please begin your confession. I shall listen carefully.",
  "str_voice_1502321_11": "I knew the day would come when I'd tell you of my sinful past. Well, I'll look you in the eye. I'm ready...",
  "str_voice_1502321_12": "Oh... These are the wounds those good disciples bandaged for me. They didn't spurn me, but were thankful for my service... Yep! I'll gratefully adapt to it!",
  "str_voice_1502321_13": "I am innocent in the eyes of The Truth! Ah... Despite my best efforts you can still hear me blaming myself, can't you?",
  "str_voice_1502321_14": "What should I confess? Your wasted time? Your wasted money? Your... Sorry. I shouldn't have said so much...",
  "str_voice_1502321_15": "Bless you. I hope to confess with you every year... no, every day!",
  "str_voice_1502321_16": "Could you help check if the wound on my back is healed? I accidentally went a little too deep last time...",
  "str_voice_1502321_17": "It's early... you're a more devout disciple of the Truth than I am.",
  "str_voice_1502321_18": "Right now? Of course. Displaying one's wounds to those who seek the Truth is what saints should do.",
  "str_voice_1502321_19": "Does sleep evade you due to the sins in your heart too? Fortunately, I have much to confess to you...",
  "str_voice_1502321_2": "I dare not hope for redemption... but when the Rare Blood condensed and took shape, and disciples praised my holiness, I did briefly think about being \"saved.\"",
  "str_voice_1502321_20": "They did not pity or reject me, but instead anticipated seeing the Lord of Truth descend upon me.",
  "str_voice_1502321_21": "Anyway, I don't belong there anymore. It's not how a saint should behave. These are my last words to them...",
  "str_voice_1502321_22": "May the Truth bless you!",
  "str_voice_1502321_23": "Do Eclipsites sometimes feel pain too?",
  "str_voice_1502321_24": "It's only because Lady Victoria accepted and guided me that I was qualified to become a saint of the lord.",
  "str_voice_1502321_25": "He reads me... seeking the root of sin in my words of confession... my teacher of the Truth, my mentor for life!",
  "str_voice_1502321_26": "As I lay dying, I heard the voice of the lord... even if it was just an illusion, I will seek it again.",
  "str_voice_1502321_27": "I've only recently realized that I hate myself. Ah... thank you. I'll be able to accept myself one day.",
  "str_voice_1502321_28": "Pardon me, but is the confessional not ready yet?",
  "str_voice_1502321_29": "Many people have seen the change in me, but you're the first to ask what I've experienced... This holy garment is a testament to the Lord of Truth's embrace.",
  "str_voice_1502321_3": "\"Where you lose, here you gain. Where you atone, here you're blessed.\" In other words... I'm not doing anything disgusting and boring, and I'm not a forsaken monster...",

  "str_voice_1502321_31": "What am I missing...?",
  "str_voice_1502321_32": "I'll always be grateful...",
  "str_voice_1502321_33": "Lord said I am innocent!",
  "str_voice_1502321_34": "I must not get my clothes dirty...",
  "str_voice_1502321_35": "The Sacred Blood is about to condense and take shape...",
  "str_voice_1502321_36": "This is not my power...",
  "str_voice_1502321_37": "I will answer for the sinners!",
  "str_voice_1502321_38": "I will listen to the victims' confessions!",
  "str_voice_1502321_39": "Painless...!",
  "str_voice_1502321_4": "The pain I see is not real, as when the wound heals I am still caught in the mood of loss. But don't worry about me, I am occasionally happy now.",
  "str_voice_1502321_40": "There are many more...!",
  "str_voice_1502321_41": "I will suffer for you...",
  "str_voice_1502321_42": "The lord washed away my sins once more.",
  "str_voice_1502321_43": "I'm not worthy to be called a saint...",
  "str_voice_1502321_44": "I am no longer filthy... right?",
  "str_voice_1502321_45": "I'll receive it on the lord's behalf...",
  "str_voice_1502321_46": "Could I really take it for myself...?",
  "str_voice_1502321_47": "You deserve it more than me.",
  "str_voice_1502321_48": "I should give myself some credit...",
  "str_voice_1502321_49": "That experience made me realize that it was shallow to only consider my own pain. Tainted blood will not vanish because I confess, I must do something with it...",
  "str_voice_1502321_5": "Do you mean the \"Nails of Piety\"? Oh... It's definitely different. Sharper, more elegant, and I can confess on more occasions. How about... Huh? You mean together?",
  "str_voice_1502321_50": "I can sometimes feel glad to be alive, but only occasionally... But when I think of my brother holding the heir's sword with that blank expression, I just...",
  "str_voice_1502321_51": "All I knew was that the True Order was a place for oddballs and outcasts... But I later discovered that it's just these weirdos who bring reason to the outside world.",
  "str_voice_1502321_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1502321_53": "If possible...",
  "str_voice_1502321_54": "A new day of confession begins.",
  "str_voice_1502321_55": "I have something else to say.",
  "str_voice_1502321_56": "Are you fed up with me...?",
  "str_voice_1502321_57": "Thank you for not tiring of me over the past year.",
  "str_voice_1502321_6": "Just as I was about to bleed out, I became briefly hypothermic... I told myself I was finally sinking into the slumber I had longed for, but my mentor enveloped me in his holiness...",
  "str_voice_1502321_7": "Disciples there say that the Lord of Truth is the god who sows night and makes all pain disappear during the day. I'm trying to think of it like this, like a kind of confession...",
  "str_voice_1502321_8": "After joining the True Order, I quickly found a reason for my hurt and guilt. But the root of confession is disgust... and the root of disgust... you don't want to know...",
  "str_voice_1502321_9": "Rare Blood is cold and stinging, but Sacred Blood is like the blazing fire of rebirth. It burns me, guides me, lets me save others as I save myself.",
  "str_voice_1502351_1": "So this is your Colossus! Everything from its shape to its structure is absolutely stunning... I won't get lost inside it, will I?",
  "str_voice_1502351_10": "... Why aren't you saying anything? I knew it. You think I'm boring, don't you? ...No? Are you sure? Okay...",
  "str_voice_1502351_11": "I understand. For as long as we're here, I vow to protect you as a dutiful knight in your service.",
  "str_voice_1502351_12": "I used to think Blue Puni were such troublesome monsters, but after seeing the Eclipsites of your world, they seem perfectly docile to me now.",
  "str_voice_1502351_13": "One of your Aurorian friends offered me membership to what appeared to be some sort of reading club. He seemed very friendly and knowledgeable, but I could barely understand anything he said.",
  "str_voice_1502351_14": "If it weren't for Klaudia, I'm sure I'd be making plenty of embarrassing purchasing mistakes in your world...",
  "str_voice_1502351_15": "Happy birthday! What do you think of your gift? Klaudia came up with the idea, and Ryza put most of it together. Hopefully, my contribution doesn't take away from its overall quality.",
  "str_voice_1502351_16": "Thank you for inviting me to a meal. Astra's cuisine is as diverse as it is delicious.",
  "str_voice_1502351_17": "Good morning. You're also a very punctual person, huh?",
  "str_voice_1502351_18": "It's getting late. Unless you plan on keeping watch tonight, maybe we should return to the Colossus?",
  "str_voice_1502351_19": "Hmm... Ah, Navigator! You're back late! Let me help you with these supplies.",
  "str_voice_1502351_2": "It's settled. I plan to study etiquette from the knights of Lumopolis, as well as leadership from the officers of the Illumina Federation.",
  "str_voice_1502351_20": "Nothing would make me happier than simply contributing in my own way.",
  "str_voice_1502351_21": "Lumopolis' architecture is splendid, but Lady Carleen makes a good point: to truly understand a domain, one must look beyond its appearance.",
  "str_voice_1502351_22": "If you try to stop me, I won't hold back!",
  "str_voice_1502351_23": "They're strange creatures, which only makes me wonder: will Ryza try to use them as materials in her alchemy?",
  "str_voice_1502351_24": "This world is full of all kinds of new materials! With a little research, Ryza could probably fashion some extraordinary explosives out of them.",
  "str_voice_1502351_25": "There's an Aurorian on the Colossus who carries a long instrument wherever she goes. It's always fun to watch her and Klaudia stare at each other without saying a word!",
  "str_voice_1502351_26": "In the past, I would've said something along the lines of \"bringing honor to my father and our family.\" But right now, I want to come up with something else.",
  "str_voice_1502351_27": "Eek, I hate bugs! I know they can't hurt me, but just hearing their wings flutter makes my hair stand on end.",
  "str_voice_1502351_28": "It's a magnificent creation with both practical and aesthetic value.",
  "str_voice_1502351_29": "A pleasure to meet you. My name is Patricia Abelheim, but you can call me Patty. While my family may not be the most prominent, I do hail from nobility and possess some skill with the blade. I trust my talents can be of use to you.",
  "str_voice_1502351_3": "Um, I'm not entirely sure what kinds of games Aurorian children enjoy. Would it be okay if I joined them?",
  "str_voice_1502351_30": "Hmm, I've gotten stronger.",
  "str_voice_1502351_31": "I will become even stronger.",
  "str_voice_1502351_32": "This must be the pace of adventure.",
  "str_voice_1502351_33": "I'll cherish all the experience I've gained here.",
  "str_voice_1502351_34": "More experience to gain.",
  "str_voice_1502351_35": "I've got this.",
  "str_voice_1502351_36": "There's no escape!",
  "str_voice_1502351_37": "Disappear in despair!",
  "str_voice_1502351_38": "Take this! Flawless Desire!",
  "str_voice_1502351_39": "Take that!",
  "str_voice_1502351_4": "My father was once a superb knight. To uphold his honor and the honor of my family, I must continue training.",
  "str_voice_1502351_40": "Try and stop me!",
  "str_voice_1502351_41": "Hm... It's my honor!",
  "str_voice_1502351_42": "There's no time to rest on my laurels.",
  "str_voice_1502351_43": "... We must retreat for now.",
  "str_voice_1502351_44": "These decorations are nothing like those in my hometown, but I appreciate their beauty all the same.",
  "str_voice_1502351_45": "I will remember your generosity. Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1502351_46": "Wow, is this...?",
  "str_voice_1502351_47": "I'd like to do more for you as well.",
  "str_voice_1502351_48": "I will never forget this moment!",
  "str_voice_1502351_49": "I am the descendant of a noble bloodline. Though I am the youngest daughter in my family, I understand the significance of my social standing, as well as my status as the daughter of a lord.",
  "str_voice_1502351_5": "Ah, so you noticed that I've also been observing Lady Carleen? It's because I want to learn her dignified demeanor, and bring myself closer to my ideal self.",
  "str_voice_1502351_50": "I must behave according to the standards of nobility, and do everything in my power to lessen my father's burden... Even if it brings me sadness and loneliness.",
  "str_voice_1502351_51": "Ryza taught me how the common folk live, and helped me understand the meaning of adventure.",
  "str_voice_1502351_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1502351_53": "Pardon me—",
  "str_voice_1502351_54": "It's so early.",
  "str_voice_1502351_55": "Well done!",
  "str_voice_1502351_56": "It's gotten so late!",
  "str_voice_1502351_57": "May you realize all of your goals this year, and find new ones to pursue... Happy New Year!",
  "str_voice_1502351_6": "I've participated in several unconventional battles since we arrived in your world. Hopefully, these experiences will guide my sword to serve you and your Colossus well.",
  "str_voice_1502351_7": "Ah, sorry for letting you see such an embarrassing side of me. I'll be sure to keep my composure next time.",
  "str_voice_1502351_8": "You think my sword skills have greatly improved? Thank you! It seems my recent training hasn't been entirely in vain.",
  "str_voice_1502351_9": "You impress me, Navigator. Whenever I don't know what to do, you're always there to help me. I'll be sure to return the favor next time.",
  "str_voice_1600011_1": "Is it urgent? You don't look like you're here for anything official... If that's the case, please allow me to excuse myself first.",
  "str_voice_1600011_10": "On a relaxing day, even the sky is bluer than usual!",
  "str_voice_1600011_11": "From the look on your face, I don't feel like I can say no to you.",
  "str_voice_1600011_12": "Keep your distance and watch what you say and do. If you do that, my sister will be slightly more accepting of you.",
  "str_voice_1600011_13": "Don't tell me you need me to praise you?... Let me think about it.",
  "str_voice_1600011_14": "I feel a little uneasy... like a small stone falling into a lake.",
  "str_voice_1600011_15": "There's nothing special about today. We just act the same as usual and enjoy the peace and quiet.",
  "str_voice_1600011_16": "Hmm? Have you any business related to me?",
  "str_voice_1600011_17": "Ah! I see, your strength ...you're an early riser.",
  "str_voice_1600011_18": "I heard the sound of you returning, so it doesn't need to be made such a big deal out of. That's all.",
  "str_voice_1600011_19": "It's quite obvious that you've disturbed me... So, rest earlier.",
  "str_voice_1600011_2": "Is what you're talking about right now really that important? You're... too close to me...",
  "str_voice_1600011_20": "Northland is the only place where we can survive, especially for my sister...",
  "str_voice_1600011_21": "Following the instructions of Her Majesty the Queen, I will watch over Lumopolis carefully with my mirror.",
  "str_voice_1600011_22": "For the North.",
  "str_voice_1600011_23": "There's no need to comment on them. Those ordinary yet harmful substances have no chance of breaching the Northland.",
  "str_voice_1600011_24": "She is the Northland itself and shelters everything pure. This is also why I admire her.",
  "str_voice_1600011_25": "Although she is a little noisy, the Queen has said that it's a good thing since she livens up the Northland palace.",
  "str_voice_1600011_26": "White flowers, leisure time, fresh clean smells...and my sister.",
  "str_voice_1600011_27": "I dislike anything that isn't clean, the mentioning of such things disgusts me.",
  "str_voice_1600011_28": "It's hard to find such a pure white color. I can tell that you cherish it.",
  "str_voice_1600011_29": "Don't behave rudely, and don't complain that Nikinis didn't remind you. Geez, everything outside the Northland is so barbaric.",
  "str_voice_1600011_3": "Self-discipline is a great virtue. What I mean is, can you try not to touch the mirror or the petals?",
  "str_voice_1600011_30": "I'm waiting for more flowers to bloom.",
  "str_voice_1600011_31": "What's clearer? The past or the future?",
  "str_voice_1600011_32": "The fate of two worlds shall be connected!",
  "str_voice_1600011_33": "I've finally crossed the far dimension.",
  "str_voice_1600011_34": "Get it over with.",
  "str_voice_1600011_35": "The Northland flowers are blooming.",
  "str_voice_1600011_36": "I don't need you to remind me.",
  "str_voice_1600011_37": "Wither and bloom—",
  "str_voice_1600011_38": "These are the spring blossoms of heaven—",
  "str_voice_1600011_39": "May there be peace and quiet.",
  "str_voice_1600011_4": "Once upon a time, the White Narcissus always stared at Lake Mirror... Well, where was the other flower? What flower was it?",

  "str_voice_1600024_17": "Good morning. I didn't wake you, did I? ...Forgive me.",
  "str_voice_1600024_18": "I'm having dry rations for dinner tonight... Oh, this isn't me rejecting your offer! But if you've already made plans, then it would be rude of me to decline.",

  "str_voice_1600024_71": "It pains me to say it, but I once had a very heavy Cloud Mountain accent...",
  "str_voice_1600041_1": "Oi, just between the two of us, tell me who is more popular, me or the big guy? Huh? That's impossible! Is everyone blind? Penguins are obviously cuter, right?",
  "str_voice_1600041_10": "Hey! Why are you spacing out? Shall we skip work together and chill out somewhere?",
  "str_voice_1600041_11": "Let's find a place to nap. This guy's tummy is really comfortable. Just follow my lead... Zzz...",
  "str_voice_1600041_12": "D-Don't poke my tummy!",
  "str_voice_1600041_13": "Oh... I just jumped a little, and now there's a crack on the floor.",
  "str_voice_1600041_14": "We're not fat, we're well-fed! Yeah, well-fed! Because mercenary make a lot of money!",
  "str_voice_1600041_15": "Come on, let's hold a birthday party! Dance! Dance!",
  "str_voice_1600041_16": "Yo! Let's have some fun together!",
  "str_voice_1600041_17": "What's for breakfast? Is there ice cream?",
  "str_voice_1600041_18": "You're late today. Where's the food?",
  "str_voice_1600041_19": "Burp! I want to have another supper.",
  "str_voice_1600041_2": "Is anyone there—! Help!! Oh, it's you! Bring me a can of meat now. Feed Kuma quickly or else he'll gobble me up as a backup food supply in his hunger!",
  "str_voice_1600041_20": "I can walk around without anyone telling me what to do here. It's very nice.",
  "str_voice_1600041_21": "My brothers in Rediesel Wrench really know how to have fun! I'm going to hang out with them too when we become normal one day!",
  "str_voice_1600041_22": "Polar!",
  "str_voice_1600041_23": "I can't eat. That's annoying.",
  "str_voice_1600041_24": "I just don't get that Kafka lass! I asked her to give us some food, but she kicked us out instead! Women!",
  "str_voice_1600041_25": "Korgon's shark tooth powder is really yummy! There just isn't very much of it...",
  "str_voice_1600041_26": "When I get to lie down on a block of ice after work, it feels like... heaven.",
  "str_voice_1600041_27": "It's so hot! I'm melting!",
  "str_voice_1600041_28": "It's a strange place with all sorts of people, and the air conditioning makes it really comfortable.",
  "str_voice_1600041_29": "Yohoho! The strongest partners on the continent are here! Leave the fighting to us, just prepare enough food for us!",
  "str_voice_1600041_3": "Hmph, things won't end well if you underestimate us. We're slightly well-known mercenaries on this continent. Ahem, especially before that accidental blast...",
  "str_voice_1600041_30": "I grew taller!",
  "str_voice_1600041_31": "I've become stronger and my feathers are glossier!",
  "str_voice_1600041_32": "Feels great!",
  "str_voice_1600041_33": "Hehe, now we're invincible, partner!",
  "str_voice_1600041_34": "Don't drag us down!",

  "str_voice_1600041_39": "I bet you didn't expect a sneak attack!",
  "str_voice_1600041_4": "Why can't we build a swimming pool on the Colossus! Kuma keeps growing, and he's starting to get too big to crawl into the cooler and cool down...",
  "str_voice_1600041_40": "Blast off!",
  "str_voice_1600041_41": "We'll fight first!",
  "str_voice_1600041_42": "There's no fight we can't win!",

  "str_voice_1600041_46": "Kuma! Look at what I've got!",
  "str_voice_1600041_47": "This is valuable. Is there work for us to do?",
  "str_voice_1600041_48": "Yay! You can have one of my treasured can food.",
  "str_voice_1600041_49": "-The north! The north! You haven't been there, right? It's completely different there! I wish I can show you the scenery there, right, Kuma?\n- Yeah.",
  "str_voice_1600041_5": "- It's so hot!\n- Ah! I get it now! Either way, get up first! Get up, you white dolt! Geez, even I'm feeling hot now...",
  "str_voice_1600041_50": "The past doesn't matter as long as my partner and I can eat as much as we like. I wish this my journey with Kuma will never end. Urgh, even I'm embarrassed by what I said... Hey, n-no laughing!",
  "str_voice_1600041_51": "- Do you want to see what I used to look like? My feathers weren't this color and I used to make weird clucking sounds.\n- That sounded terrible.",
  "str_voice_1600041_52": "- Alchemy?\n- Stars!!",
  "str_voice_1600041_53": "Yo! I'm looking for you!",
  "str_voice_1600041_54": "Morning! Today's a good day!",
  "str_voice_1600041_55": "You're here too?",
  "str_voice_1600041_56": "Stop sleeping! Come and help me!",
  "str_voice_1600041_57": "- New Year?\n- It's gonna be a good year! Happy New Year!",
  "str_voice_1600041_6": "- I'm so bored! Will you play a game of baseball using grenades with me? It's SUPER exciting!\n- Okay, I'll play.\n- What are you doing? Get away from me! Wait—!!!",
  "str_voice_1600041_7": "Oh? Are you interested in our dance? You've got surprisingly good taste! If you're sincere about becoming my student, maybe I might just teach you. Hehe!",
  "str_voice_1600041_8": "This tastes quite good. Here, have some.",
  "str_voice_1600041_9": "Tsk, I-I don't know what to do about you. Maybe I'll give you permission to stroke my full and smooth feathers... Don't stroke it in the wrong direction though!",
  "str_voice_1600051_1": "Why not have some tea with our new friends and enjoy the last fun moments of our lives together?",
  "str_voice_1600051_10": "\"Whenever the stars and moon are dim, black spiders rise from the graves to devour the denizens who have lost their way...\" What kind of fool wrote something as ludicrous as this!",
  "str_voice_1600051_11": "Me, you want me to stay here? You do know I'm rumored to be a thing of nightmares from the graves, right?",
  "str_voice_1600051_12": "You just touched me, didn't you? If it were Mia, she'd probably cry.",
  "str_voice_1600051_13": "I want black tea... and snacks... tea... and snacks...",
  "str_voice_1600051_14": "If I smile like this, I'd be like Baba Yaga, right? Hm... Well, she has my face anyway.",
  "str_voice_1600051_15": "Sorry for appearing out of the blue! She said I should probably be the one doing this... you know, celebrate your birthday.",

  "str_voice_1600051_17": "Don't you know NOT to disturb me this early!?",
  "str_voice_1600051_18": "Wait. Are you... expecting a welcome from me? Then... Wel-come!",
  "str_voice_1600051_19": "Time for a pleasant horror experience. Shall we go check out some... black spiders?",
  "str_voice_1600051_2": "How about I tie strings on your soul and let's dance away at our afternoon tea session! Come on!",
  "str_voice_1600051_20": "You seriously think that I'd belong there? That white castle? You must be out of your mind...",
  "str_voice_1600051_21": "These machines... Those researchers must be having the time of their lives. I'm grateful, of course.",

  "str_voice_1600051_25": "Although she possesses this body most of the time, she does let me use it whenever I nag.",
  "str_voice_1600051_26": "What is it? You want to please us? Where're our black tea and snacks?",
  "str_voice_1600051_27": "What do you think of me? Annoying? What? I thought you really wanted to talk about it?",
  "str_voice_1600051_28": "I'm smelling a scent that makes me unhappy coming from somewhere in here...",
  "str_voice_1600051_29": "Come. Closer. Your noble hostess is inviting you to join this tea party. She and I are having a very good time at this tea party—",
  "str_voice_1600051_3": "Oh, these mechanical claws? No worries. They don't hurt one bit—at least, no one ever complained!",
  "str_voice_1600051_30": "You are very interested in me, are you not?",
  "str_voice_1600051_31": "Yes, my dear sister. We are no longer who we were...",
  "str_voice_1600051_32": "Bow down before me! For I feast on your souls!",
  "str_voice_1600051_33": "I will await you in the love nest of punishment, Carleen!",

  "str_voice_1600051_41": "A playland in Hell, that belongs to just me!",

  "str_voice_1600051_5": "The honorable nobleman's house had a backyard; the forgotten backyard had an old grave; deep in the damp old grave slept a woman; and in the smile of the woman... Oh, what did you see?",
  "str_voice_1600051_50": "When did it happen? Back when Father still loved me, Mother was still with me, my sister was still a cry-baby... and the war had yet begun.",
  "str_voice_1600051_51": "He meant to bury the secrets of Lumopolis along with me... But one day, they shall make a comeback... Just you wait, my dear father...",

  "str_voice_1600051_9": "Is it fear or excitement on your face... when you stare into my eyes? Oh, you want me to guess? How mischievous.",
  "str_voice_1600061_1": "It is harder to make decisions when there's a crowd. Minds are a lot clearer when we are alone.",
  "str_voice_1600061_10": "If I may, you still have a quest to complete, and yet so unmotivated you are... Argh, nobody is appraising you anyway.",
  "str_voice_1600061_11": "Such a beautiful place it is. I hope your commanding would complement the beauty of this place.",

  "str_voice_1600061_18": "Most of the work has been done. We need to compile a report.",
  "str_voice_1600061_19": "Take some rest. There must be a lot of matters waiting for you to deal with tomorrow.",
  "str_voice_1600061_2": "Standing in the middle of the Hall of Justice and the Elder Council, we must first know our position before we can take the right action.",

  "str_voice_1600061_26": "What do I like? Simple. The art of war, watching competitions... and milk treats.",
  "str_voice_1600061_27": "I don't like people who have no sense of time. Please bear that in mind.",
  "str_voice_1600061_28": "This Colossus is very complete. It may be able to carry my... No, nothing.",

  "str_voice_1600061_49": "I've been trying to get to know him... I mean my father, the ruler of Lumopolis. Sorry, but I'm just not used to calling him by that yet, due to some unforgotten past...",
  "str_voice_1600061_5": "The confidence Lumopolis' people have in it is still fresh. Surely it would not want to put it to the test with power, especially during this era of chaos. I'm sure this is what Mother thinks as well.",
  "str_voice_1600061_50": "Old wound heals slow. No longer is anyone keen on digging the city's past. Too much has happened during the last decade. Some tragedies befell upon my family but no one is willing to tell me the truth...",
  "str_voice_1600061_51": "There was a sense of chilliness this restful night. Now I can only relive the past looking at the portraits of my family. Ridiculous? No, it's just sad. What secrets lie in the core of this city?...",

  "str_voice_1600061_57": "Happy New Year.",
  "str_voice_1600061_6": "Black Spider? It's just boring hearsay used to numb the pain in the reality. If it exists, the Guardians would have captured it long ago.",
  "str_voice_1600061_7": "Trust is usually the breeding ground for betrayal. However, you seem to be different from the others out there, your Excellency. I am rarely wrong about people.",
  "str_voice_1600061_8": "The more cracks there are on the ice, the weaker it gets, and so it is with Lumopolis... You must have been able to tell fairly early.",
  "str_voice_1600061_9": "Mutual recognition and respect are the hardest to come by. I am determined to push the legacy to the peak and hope that you would witness it.",
  "str_voice_1600064_10": "Still looking at me? I might have to freeze you into an ice cube...",
  "str_voice_1600064_11": "The scenery is gorgeous and the wind is refreshing... This reminds me of Northland, cold but relaxing, not like Lumopolis.",

  "str_voice_1600064_17": "You are up early... Please keep it up. This is great.",
  "str_voice_1600064_18": "The night view of the Colossus is quite good. I'll give you a tour of Lumopolis at night one day.",
  "str_voice_1600064_19": "Still up? What might you be thinking of? In case you don't know... I'm a good listener.",
  "str_voice_1600064_35": "The fog has condensed.",
  "str_voice_1600064_36": "Waiting to be released.",

  "str_voice_1600064_58": "Even the best of friends fight and argue. So do lovers. Right?",
  "str_voice_1600064_59": "You need to relax a little from time to time. Being nervous all the time will break down your mind.",
  "str_voice_1600064_60": "Sometimes it's helpful to come out of your regular way of thinking to try new things and see things from a different angle.",
  "str_voice_1600064_61": "I wonder how girls dress up in other parts of the world.",
  "str_voice_1600064_62": "I heard Umbraton is very open and modern. But openness without restrictions might lead to depravity.",
  "str_voice_1600064_63": "When on patrol, we need to be dignified and friendly. The most important thing is to provide a sense of safety.",

  "str_voice_1600064_72": "Have you had lunch yet?",

  "str_voice_1600101_1": "What is it? Upset again? Look! A bunny has come to comfort you. Feeling better now?",
  "str_voice_1600101_10": "Remove that pile of firewood. All sources of fire are prohibited here! Huh? I don't care! It's. Just. Prohibited!",
  "str_voice_1600101_11": "Hi! Are you here for a bedtime story? We've got \"Little Snowman and Twelve Stars\", \"The Elf's Cottage\", \"The Dragon's Child!\" and many others! Which one is your cup of tea?",
  "str_voice_1600101_12": "Would you like to see some magic? Look, what's here in my pocket... Ta-da! Candy!",
  "str_voice_1600101_13": "What kind of elf do you want to be? I can portray you the way you like in the story!",
  "str_voice_1600101_14": "Pick an item from my pocket and give it to someone you cherish!",
  "str_voice_1600101_15": "Happy birthday! Do you want snowman, candies, fairy tale books, or saplings?",
  "str_voice_1600101_16": "Welcome back! You must be tired. Have some candies to fuel up!",
  "str_voice_1600101_17": "Whoa—Good morning. I think I dreamed of a candy ship yesterday... You?",
  "str_voice_1600101_18": "Let's go to a warm place where we could sit, have candies, and read stories.",
  "str_voice_1600101_19": "Huh? What is it? You can't sleep? Would you like a bedtime story?",
  "str_voice_1600101_2": "I've been taking care of a little world that has always been neglected. Perhaps one day the strength of that world would become the key to saving us.",
  "str_voice_1600101_20": "The Northland, like the forests in fairy tales, has all kinds of mythical beings living in them.",
  "str_voice_1600101_21": "Hmm... I've never been to any other places, but I know about the underground cottage in the story!",
  "str_voice_1600101_22": "It's created by the end of winter.",
  "str_voice_1600101_23": "They've also appeared in the story, the black seawater that makes its way here bit by bit!",
  "str_voice_1600101_24": "Little Noah is so cute! Even fairy tales feature her. I read you that, didn't I?",
  "str_voice_1600101_25": "My sister always staring quietly into the mirror, like the White Narcissus in the story.",
  "str_voice_1600101_26": "Fairy tales, candy, candy wrappers, homemade gingerbread house... I like a lot of things!",
  "str_voice_1600101_27": "Hmm... I don't like things I can't describe. Neither can I record them, nor can I talk about them.",
  "str_voice_1600101_28": "The colossi are more akin to the giant dragons in fairy tales. They're unlike any of the dragons I've ever met!",
  "str_voice_1600101_29": "You look like you've been through a lot. Would you mind if I make you the protagonist of my story? It may become a bestseller in the Northland!",
  "str_voice_1600101_3": "You're neither careful nor responsible... Do you think you'd as an adult by just growing tall and growing a beard? You're wrong!",
  "str_voice_1600101_30": "My pocket is almost full!",
  "str_voice_1600101_31": "It's happening! It's happening! The big parade is about to begin!",
  "str_voice_1600101_32": "Come and join this amazing journey!",
  "str_voice_1600101_33": "Everyone's wishes are written in fairy tales!",
  "str_voice_1600101_34": "Materials for a new story!",
  "str_voice_1600101_35": "Elves! For the glory of Her Majesty the Queen!",
  "str_voice_1600101_36": "Let's wreak some havoc!!",
  "str_voice_1600101_37": "To the realm of fairy tales!",
  "str_voice_1600101_38": "It is again the beginning of a wonderful dream!",
  "str_voice_1600101_39": "We must cherish books!",
  "str_voice_1600101_4": "The Pocket World has grown increasingly restless, causing harm to people around it whenever there's a distraction! The Queen told me that I must put in more effort and learn to control this power!",
  "str_voice_1600101_40": "Vandalism is forbidden!",
  "str_voice_1600101_41": "Gather round, elf squad!",
  "str_voice_1600101_42": "Awesome!! I can write about it in my story!",
  "str_voice_1600101_43": "Urgh! This is not fun...",
  "str_voice_1600101_44": "Let me teach you some magic? Let's first make a box appear, then put some candies in it.",
  "str_voice_1600101_45": "Have you forgotten? I'm a creator!",
  "str_voice_1600101_46": "This is something I can't create! Thank you so much!",
  "str_voice_1600101_47": "Why don't I also conjure something up for you in return?",
  "str_voice_1600101_48": "Wow! I'm so happy! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!",
  "str_voice_1600101_49": "Nanny Lita is the only family I have left. She often tells me stories from my childhood. They were so dangerous. I was so close to losing my life!",
  "str_voice_1600101_5": "My candy box is going to turn into my enemy's coffin soon. My power is so scary! Oh, dear...",
  "str_voice_1600101_50": "Mom and dad are always on faraway journeys. I heard they've gone somewhere far. Yeah, they're going to climb over the frozen snowy mountain. I wonder if they're going to meet any ice elves.",
  "str_voice_1600101_51": "Chapters that shouldn't appear in fairy tales should be deleted... The fairy tales always end nicely, so should our story. All's gonna end well!",

  "str_voice_1600101_53": "Hello there!",
  "str_voice_1600101_54": "Oh... Good morning.",
  "str_voice_1600101_55": "I have some candies to share with you.",
  "str_voice_1600101_56": "Well, I can't sleep...",
  "str_voice_1600101_57": "Happy New Year!",
  "str_voice_1600101_6": "There will be more fairy tales in this world, which will be more full of life from everyone's dreams! Just like this newly created one carrying our journey!",
  "str_voice_1600101_7": "Elves work for Her Majesty the Queen, and it is my duty to record the stories of the Northland. Wanna have a peek?",
  "str_voice_1600101_8": "I am building a candy cottage. What flavor do you think the window should be? This is a custom of the Northland.",
  "str_voice_1600101_9": "Are you asking for my opinion?! I thought you only think of me as a child... I'm so moved!",
  "str_voice_1600111_1": "What do I fight for? I feed on the resentment of blood and fire, but I'm afraid that's not the answer you want.",
  "str_voice_1600111_10": "Danger strikes when we let down our guard. A giant dragon keeps one eye open even when it sleeps.",
  "str_voice_1600111_11": "You've got quite a big appetite. I hope the same goes for your courage.",
  "str_voice_1600111_12": "Whatever it is, make it short. I got public affairs to tend to and don't have much time.",
  "str_voice_1600111_13": "Have you forgotten how to greet others? Stop shaking and stand still!",
  "str_voice_1600111_14": "Do you want to improve yourself? Very good, I will design a training plan for you. Come to my room at 6 in the morning tomorrow!",
  "str_voice_1600111_15": "I should say something to those who never give up in a fight. So come over here and sit with me, my compatriot.",
  "str_voice_1600111_16": "You're here, just in time. Let's do something together. We'll leave once we plan and decide when to attack.",
  "str_voice_1600111_17": "Very good, you should cherish your training time. There's no time to lose, let's start right now.",
  "str_voice_1600111_18": "Keep your spirits up! This isn't the time to relax yet!",
  "str_voice_1600111_19": "You'll need enough rest to become stronger. Go sleep while I stand guard here.",
  "str_voice_1600111_2": "My Azure Flame Sword feasts on the fear of my enemies, but that is not the case for my wings and dragon scales as evil can never touch them.",
  "str_voice_1600111_20": "When I was lost, Illumina showed me new beliefs that saved me from being devoured by my hatred.",
  "str_voice_1600111_21": "My clan owes that floating city nothing. All that remains is disappointment and ineffable hatred.",

  "str_voice_1600111_24": "She is brave and strong, she insists on her will while never being swayed by it. I am nowhere near her level.",
  "str_voice_1600111_25": "I couldn't see \"will\" on her. I wonder what that lazy cat is thinking about?",
  "str_voice_1600111_26": "Other than training... This is the emblem of my clan. It gives me strength.",
  "str_voice_1600111_27": "I don't really care about tails. What I really detest is a corrupt system and brutal rule.",
  "str_voice_1600111_28": "Do you stare at this Colossus sometimes? Just like how I often stare at my clan emblem.",
  "str_voice_1600111_29": "Have you never seen an Aurorian as beautiful as me? Fine, I won't blame you as there are indeed few of us, even in the past. Sharona, at your service.",
  "str_voice_1600111_3": "A dragon's wrath has many similarities to the fighting skills that Hiiro has mastered—they are eternal, deadly, and absolutely ruthless. However, it's still far from matching the Grand Marshal...",

  "str_voice_1600111_31": "The lost bloodline of our clan is boiling!",

  "str_voice_1600231_10": "It's kind of a weird tone... Not that it brings up bad feelings or anything. Rather, it's reassuring. It won't send people to the hospital again, will it? Here we go.",

  "str_voice_1600231_27": "- A long long time ago, there was a cafe...\n- Yelp!\n- Huh? I'm not even telling a ghost story!",
  "str_voice_1600231_28": "It's so big... It can actually fit quite a few Holiday Cafes and... so many people...",
  "str_voice_1600231_29": "Uh, I seem to be lost! No, it's not like that. I'm Connolly. This is Anton and its... relatives... I assume?",

  "str_voice_1600231_30": "I obviously had no intention to become stronger...",

  "str_voice_1600231_48": "Here... here's your c-coffee. To return your favor.",
  "str_voice_1600231_49": "Its name is Anton. Its name is also Anton... I was also confused at first, but if you listen carefully, you'll notice that they sound slightly different.",

  "str_voice_1600231_50": "My parents. I wish I could see them again and tell them I can properly talk to Anton now. This clarinet that I've received as a gift has also been preserved carefully...",
  "str_voice_1600231_51": "Grandma. I wish grandma could be here as well... Huh? That person? I can do without him. I-I can't look him in the eye! And it's not because I'm a wuss. Anton can't either! None of us can!",

  "str_voice_1600231_57": "Happy New Year...",
  "str_voice_1600231_6": "- Connolly.\n- Poor, fragile Connolly. Don't be afraid. Do you hear us?\n- Listen to our voices. We'll keep you company.\n- Such... tender darkness. I'm no longer alone...",
  "str_voice_1600231_7": "You... you asked me... who... I was talking to just now? But... they... they're right here...",
  "str_voice_1600231_8": "Well... Anton likes it very much, too... Looks like you're trustworthy...",
  "str_voice_1600231_9": "I always think... that if I'm with you, I won't ever feel scared again no matter where I go. So... could... could you come closer?",
  "str_voice_1600234_1": "Hi, remember me? I'm Connolly, nice to see you again... Hey, I managed to get it out!",
  "str_voice_1600234_10": "Good morning, would you like coffee? There's black tea too.",
  "str_voice_1600234_11": "It's past the time, but if you like, I'll be glad to make afternoon tea for you...",
  "str_voice_1600234_12": "Look at the bottomless deep blue of the night sky. It's like the bottom of the ocean. Without you, I'm sure I couldn't have faced it alone...",
  "str_voice_1600234_13": "Excuse me, but I'm ready to play...",
  "str_voice_1600234_14": "Ready, Anton?",
  "str_voice_1600234_15": "Hopefully this won't bother anybody.",

  "str_voice_1600234_24": "My clarinet...! Oh, thank goodness I didn't lose it.",
  "str_voice_1600234_25": "Ahem, p-please allow me to perform a solo.",
  "str_voice_1600234_26": "This outfit is great for dancing? But can I dance...?",
  "str_voice_1600234_27": "Oh my, being a tea party host is far more exhausting than being a cafe server...",
  "str_voice_1600234_28": "I want to run away, but it's hard to even hide in this costume!",
  "str_voice_1600234_29": "Even it was only a dream, the lessons I learned from it are not an illusion, right?",

  "str_voice_1600234_30": "Thank you for coming to Anton's and my tea party.",
  "str_voice_1600234_31": "Oh, why me...?",
  "str_voice_1600234_32": "It's ridiculous for me to be queen!",
  "str_voice_1600234_33": "I need to hide, take refuge in the familiar darkness...",
  "str_voice_1600234_34": "Music has power... and I want them to hear my anger!",
  "str_voice_1600234_35": "No one's watching me, no one's watching me...",
  "str_voice_1600234_36": "Huff, huff...",
  "str_voice_1600234_37": "Huh?",
  "str_voice_1600234_4": "*Humming*",
  "str_voice_1600234_5": "T-Thanks for coming. I have snacks and coffee for you, if you don't mind...",
  "str_voice_1600234_6": "I got a new tune in my mind after waking up from a dream... Can I play it for you when I'm ready?",
  "str_voice_1600234_7": "I dreamed that Anton used to be even more powerful before... But I feel content with the present since their company is precious enough for me.",
  "str_voice_1600234_8": "What was Anton and I talking about? Well, about me and you... Wait, I shouldn't have told you that...",
  "str_voice_1600234_9": "Sorry, but I'd like to practice a new tune. Will it disturb you? What?! No, you don't have to take time out just to listen to it!",
  "str_voice_1600251_1": "Humph... The loneliness of the soul and true art are things that few can understand. All artists are lonely, and I don't work well with others...",
  "str_voice_1600251_10": "\"Those who have reached the end of their destiny! Struggle! Shout! Your face, frantic with fear, shall be my...\" Hmm, this part is a little awkward.",
  "str_voice_1600251_11": "Part the curtain of the dark night dreamily, and I shall steer you toward the light. Can I stand here forever?",
  "str_voice_1600251_12": "All I need is Other End. My other friends... I can do without.",
  "str_voice_1600251_13": "People will always leave me for different reasons, getting off when they reach the stop of their destination...",
  "str_voice_1600251_14": "Other End seems to like you a lot. In that case, I'll reserve a spot for you on stage!",
  "str_voice_1600251_15": "It is the grand opening of my show, and you are the protagonist! Don't be shy, now dance! Haha!",
  "str_voice_1600251_16": "The Wraith Train, at your service.",
  "str_voice_1600251_17": "Really? You're up so early just to prepare such an elaborate stage specially for me ?",
  "str_voice_1600251_18": "We've stepped onto the next stage! Come! Join us!",
  "str_voice_1600251_19": "You're just in time as the Wraith Train is about to depart. Get on if you want to reach the other side!",
  "str_voice_1600251_2": "Argh, I'm so busy. Wanna watch a musical? Invited a lot of people? Really? In that case, I'll make an exception and perform again—",
  "str_voice_1600251_20": "Our destiny is tied with Illumina. We've been here twice, and it's now the place we call home for all of eternity.",
  "str_voice_1600251_21": "Pursuit is nothing but the manifestation of one's self-consciousness. Something that is imposed is not necessarily the truth.",
  "str_voice_1600251_22": "Splendor—Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1600251_23": "We, who have returned from hell, shall face our fears head-on.",
  "str_voice_1600251_24": "I dare not comment on her, as I did lose... But if it's about how to operate a train...",
  "str_voice_1600251_25": "To see through everything and embark on a lonely road without hesitation—that is what a born leader is like.",
  "str_voice_1600251_26": "A lonely stage, a free life, and a rock n' roll train journey. These are the things I love!",
  "str_voice_1600251_27": "There's no room for tasteless lunatics in an artist's life.",
  "str_voice_1600251_28": "Just like me and Other End, this Colossus is your partner, right?",
  "str_voice_1600251_29": "I am the ferryman of evil spirits and the underworld. I am not a skeleton of hell nor an apostle of Bright. I am Charon, and I travel fearlessly in a blood-stained world.",
  "str_voice_1600251_3": "Someone complained about the noises we're making? Who's complaining that my old buddy is noisy? Surely it must be a plebian with poor taste...",
  "str_voice_1600251_30": "Speed up!",
  "str_voice_1600251_31": "We are arriving at the River Styx.",
  "str_voice_1600251_32": "The train to hell has departed!",
  "str_voice_1600251_33": "This is the train of the dead! Haha!",
  "str_voice_1600251_34": "I never thought I'd have the chance...",
  "str_voice_1600251_35": "Listen to the ear-piercing whistle!",
  "str_voice_1600251_36": "Full speed ahead!",
  "str_voice_1600251_37": "Hellbound! On its way!",
  "str_voice_1600251_38": "The dead! Shall give way!",
  "str_voice_1600251_39": "Power test!",
  "str_voice_1600251_4": "Look, I just have to shout \"Feel the terror of the train from hell!\" and my old buddy will rush out. Do you want to see it?",
  "str_voice_1600251_40": "Hellfire Signal!",
  "str_voice_1600251_41": "Spotlights on me! The protagonist takes the stage!",
  "str_voice_1600251_42": "We come from hell. Losing is not possible.",
  "str_voice_1600251_43": "Run! Grab my hand!",
  "str_voice_1600251_44": "Do you want to see the next act of the play? Come on, tell me you want to!",
  "str_voice_1600251_45": "I think the last time I got a gift was in the last century...",
  "str_voice_1600251_46": "Ohhh! Is this a gift from a kindred soul?!",
  "str_voice_1600251_47": "Gift-giving is such a touching scene!",
  "str_voice_1600251_48": "How wonderful! This is a gift from my dear friend!",
  "str_voice_1600251_49": "So what if you're misunderstood and alienated by old friends? Days spent on enjoying wine without worrying about others are much better!",
  "str_voice_1600251_5": "Peace will continue to elude me forever. It is an endless curse and a carnival of the lonely...",
  "str_voice_1600251_50": "I'll never forget my mother's face behind the window... I can watch her forever without noticing time passing...",
  "str_voice_1600251_51": "My family used to spoil me, but they didn't understand back then that Other End was also family to me. The decision made at that difficult time was fate conspiring against us...",
  "str_voice_1600251_52": "Alchemy—Stars!",
  "str_voice_1600251_53": "Greetings my friends!",
  "str_voice_1600251_54": "What a gorgeous morning!",
  "str_voice_1600251_55": "Please pay attention!",
  "str_voice_1600251_56": "It's show time now!",
  "str_voice_1600251_57": "This... This is the sound of the New Year!",
  "str_voice_1600251_6": "Focus! This is my grandest performance! Charon, Other End, and countless souls who thirst for a show full of life have returned from hell!",
  "str_voice_1600251_7": "Please wait for a moment... Here are your tea and snacks. Dear audience, please return to your seats!",
  "str_voice_1600251_8": "You fled alone so quickly and so far. Why didn't you take me with you? You know I'll always be on your side no matter what you are or what you do...",
  "str_voice_1600251_9": "The days that I spent with the Grand Marshal were the happiest days of my life, and I felt like I had been redeemed... Now that I've met you, the script of destiny is complete!",
  "str_voice_1600254_10": "What's with the silence? Were you so floored by my acting skills that you forgot to clap?",
  "str_voice_1600254_11": "Want me to perform a play just for you? Dim the lights. Uh, wait... leave two spotlights—one on me and another one, of course, on my one and only spectator.",
  "str_voice_1600254_16": "The good and the sinister can be equally artistic. Which do you prefer today?",
  "str_voice_1600254_17": "Costume, makeup, presentation? Perfect! Lights? We don't need lights when we have the most wonderful natural morning sun!",
  "str_voice_1600254_18": "Good evening my friend! Please note, the cameraman is still recording.",
  "str_voice_1600254_19": "Come on then! Let yourself fall into this silent, thick night, and you'll surely get the inspiration you need.",
  "str_voice_1600254_35": "Camera, ready.",
  "str_voice_1600254_36": "Lights on me!",
  "str_voice_1600254_37": "Let us roar and liven up the place!",
  "str_voice_1600254_38": "Here comes the climax!",
  "str_voice_1600254_39": "The perfect acting range is mine to command.",
  "str_voice_1600254_40": "No, this is your script!",
  "str_voice_1600254_44": "Hmm? You must want one of my signed posters, right?",
  "str_voice_1600254_58": "I only wear this gorgeous, custom-tailored evening wear for the most formal, prestigious occasions when I'm being an actor. Of course, there are exceptions, like right now.",
  "str_voice_1600254_59": "Which of my projects shall we watch today? Actually, the choice is hard so... let's watch them all!",
  "str_voice_1600254_60": "You have quite a few stories to tell... PlayerName, let's turn your life story into a play! We can ride the Other End and perform it all around the world!",
  "str_voice_1600254_61": "\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about...\" What's survival to an artist except to avoid the terrible indignity of popular indifference?",
  "str_voice_1600254_62": "A talented artist can make something marvelous out of the most ordinary script. Don't believe me? Very well, I'll show you.",
  "str_voice_1600254_63": "PlayerName, viewer who understands me like no other, it's great that you are here! Now let's review the filmography of the performing arts genius, Charon the Acheron Ferryman!",
  "str_voice_1600254_64": "Good morning, my dearest friend and supporter!",
  "str_voice_1600254_65": "Sleeping in on a drowsy morning always brings the most bizarre dreams.",
  "str_voice_1600254_66": "The morning is just as beautiful on a day full of work as on a day full of rest!",
  "str_voice_1600254_67": "Act 1, Scene 1!",
  "str_voice_1600254_68": "Good evening, friend.",
  "str_voice_1600254_69": "I do so love to rewatch my films in the evening.",
  "str_voice_1600254_70": "Why does inspiration elude me so...?",
  "str_voice_1600254_71": "\"Goodnight, my darling youth.\"",
  "str_voice_1600254_72": "Hey! You shouldn't be the one to say goodnight to me!",
  "str_voice_1600254_73": "My most flattering camera angle? All 360 degrees.",
  "str_voice_1600254_74": "Look what we have here. A perfect me, and a nearly perfect you.",
  "str_voice_1600254_75": "There is such a thing as being too charismatic, perhaps.",
  "str_voice_1600254_76": "I would like, if it were possible, not to have the curtain close on my involvement in your life.",
  "str_voice_1600254_77": "An extraordinary world does not require understanding from those who are mediocre.",
  "str_voice_1600261_1": "Born in a burning coffin, wandered the barren land. Look at those broken limbs, there is no fairness, no meaning.",
  "str_voice_1600261_10": "I am in an incorporeal state again. No, maybe this is the normal state of life. Just like how some aunties like to live in a humble cage, maybe I am doomed to curl up here and talk to myself.",
  "str_voice_1600261_11": "I... I'm not opposed to being here. Your gaze is unlike that of other people as it doesn't give me that stinging hypocritical sensation.",
  "str_voice_1600261_12": "It would be great if I could stay in the barrel forever... I won't hear any wailing or screaming there.",
  "str_voice_1600261_13": "Another boring job... I hope no one will come supervise...",
  "str_voice_1600261_14": "Is someone speaking... or am I hearing things again?",
  "str_voice_1600261_15": "So, today is your day of rebirth... Will it hurt? It'll be great if it doesn't hurt.",
  "str_voice_1600261_16": "You're here again. You're always on-time, unlike death who makes sudden visits.",
  "str_voice_1600261_17": "Is a new day ahead of me again? What is the purpose of experiencing all this...",
  "str_voice_1600261_18": "The flame prison has calmed down slightly for now... There will probably be more harsher sounds to come.",
  "str_voice_1600261_19": "At this hour... Those who should sleep are asleep, and those who should be awake are awake... My chest hurts.",
  "str_voice_1600261_2": "I've seen it burn down civilizations—yes, the very thing underneath your feet. Perhaps you do have the talent to cleanse sins...",
  "str_voice_1600261_20": "It is a land that was reborn in flames... It is white, just like how it is in my memories.",
  "str_voice_1600261_21": "Before everything ended, I remember seeing a person in long clothes... I didn't manage to say thank you in time...",
  "str_voice_1600261_22": "White Night... up high.",
  "str_voice_1600261_23": "That which comes from hell... should return to hell.",
  "str_voice_1600261_24": "I burned my aunt's dress, and branches by mistake... It must have troubled her plenty... I'm sorry...",
  "str_voice_1600261_25": "It was a crack of thunder and lighting... But the look in her eyes... told me that everything was fine.",
  "str_voice_1600261_26": "I like it... but I don't understand... It'll be great if I can just space out and not think about anything.",
  "str_voice_1600261_27": "I don't understand... What's the meaning of existence? What is... the meaning?",
  "str_voice_1600261_28": "The energy inside the Colossus and the purgatory flames here are... very similar.",
  "str_voice_1600261_29": "I'm Uriel. I'm just burning my life aimlessly. You can try to give my body a purpose, but don't get your hopes up.",
  "str_voice_1600261_3": "Don't comfort me because I'm not sad. Don't give me your superficial care like those others. Please, don't. Just leave me alone.",
  "str_voice_1600261_30": "Still making these pointless efforts.",
  "str_voice_1600261_31": "T-the pain... It's going out of control...",
  "str_voice_1600261_32": "Is this power or a curse!?",
  "str_voice_1600261_33": "Don't look at me like that! This is hell!!",
  "str_voice_1600261_34": "Everyone, stay away from me.",
  "str_voice_1600261_35": "The purgatory capacity is at its limit—",
  "str_voice_1600261_36": "My chest is going to burst...",
  "str_voice_1600261_37": "You shall see the doom again...",
  "str_voice_1600261_38": "Usher you into the new hell...",
  "str_voice_1600261_39": "Be purified—",
  "str_voice_1600261_4": "My skin and face have recovered and healed. I am a lifeform that goes against the flow. However, my once shattered body will have cracks for all of eternity...",
  "str_voice_1600261_40": "To the void...",
  "str_voice_1600261_41": "I'm afraid not even ashes will remain...",
  "str_voice_1600261_42": "I envy these liberated souls.",
  "str_voice_1600261_43": "Is it possible that there is a bigger hell that contains hell?",
  "str_voice_1600261_44": "Aren't you afraid of the power of the purgatory? How fascinating...",
  "str_voice_1600261_45": "... Why did you give me this?",
  "str_voice_1600261_46": "Oh? This seems interesting.",
  "str_voice_1600261_47": "Sorry, this... I'm not sure if I like it.",
  "str_voice_1600261_48": "Oh, I guess... I kind of like this. Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1600261_49": "I was born in a burning coffin and wandered on this land of nothingness. Now I live in a cage called White Night.",
  "str_voice_1600261_5": "The apocalypse assaulted me, like a bamboo thorn rammed under my nails. Even now, it is still pressing against my chest, except it is pushing outwards from the inside...",
  "str_voice_1600261_50": "Maybe we all died the day the war broke out, and everything we see now is a bubble before our souls are destroyed. That would be too boring.",
  "str_voice_1600261_51": "I never look back because I have already died once, twice—no, countless times. I have become one with purgatory, never straying too far from hell.",
  "str_voice_1600261_52": "Alchemy... Stars.",
  "str_voice_1600261_53": "Hey...",
  "str_voice_1600261_54": "Hey... Are you there?",
  "str_voice_1600261_55": "Do... Do you have time?",
  "str_voice_1600261_56": "It's late, but are you still here...?",
  "str_voice_1600261_57": "The New Year... isn't a happy one.",
  "str_voice_1600261_6": "Papa, mama... Although my body is ravaged with wounds and pain, I now have a reason to continue fighting... Please continue to enwrap me until the day we are reunited...",
  "str_voice_1600261_7": "Do you want to hear an old story? A story of how I died and entered purgatory?",
  "str_voice_1600261_8": "My chest is a well. It is a flame prison that burns forever, inflicting a bone-piercing pain. Do you know what is locked inside? Do you want to tear it open and take a peek?",
  "str_voice_1600261_9": "Come closer and lie against my chest. Do you hear it? That's the sound of the flames of the past... Now, step back before you also descend into purgatory.",
  "str_voice_1600264_1": "My outfit will burst into flame when the potion wears off. Will you follow the last trail of the blaze to me?",
  "str_voice_1600264_10": "Don't go! Otherwise, when you come back, there might be only ashes left...",
  "str_voice_1600264_11": "There's no purpose to existing, but you let me stay here and made it meaningful... *hiccup*",
  "str_voice_1600264_12": "Do you prefer a pitiful flicker or a blaze that consumes all...? Hold on! If your answer isn't right, the potion won't work anymore.",
  "str_voice_1600264_13": "Doomsday? I don't care about those things... Everything will end eventually, so we should all be a little more unrestrained.",
  "str_voice_1600264_14": "If you can bear a scorching heart and burning passion, I don't mind giving it to you. No, I haven't had too much of the potion...",
  "str_voice_1600264_16": "Welcome to another day of emptiness! Let's make it meaningful, shall we?",
  "str_voice_1600264_17": "Are you going to snooze some more, or should I light up your dreams?",
  "str_voice_1600264_18": "Supper time? Rather than the food, I'm more interested in the person holding the plate before me.",
  "str_voice_1600264_19": "Drat, I took the potion and I'm a new person, but why does my chest still hurt? (Sobs) Oh, help me...",
  "str_voice_1600264_2": "You want to take the potion too? Nope. I like you as you are now.",
  "str_voice_1600264_3": "You want to be in the Limbo with me? Take my hand then, and let our hopes burn bright!",
  "str_voice_1600264_35": "The gate to Limbo has been opened!",
  "str_voice_1600264_36": "Hold my hand tightly—",
  "str_voice_1600264_37": "We will go to the end of hell together.",
  "str_voice_1600264_38": "Let's journey to the end of the world together.",
  "str_voice_1600264_39": "Vulcan!",
  "str_voice_1600264_40": "Limbo is burning!",
  "str_voice_1600264_44": "Can I wait for the end of time with you here?",
  "str_voice_1600264_58": "Good morning! I'm doing my best to get my spirits up.",
  "str_voice_1600264_59": "Did you see the sunrise this morning?",
  "str_voice_1600264_60": "Can you come over to me?",
  "str_voice_1600264_61": "(Yawns) Mmm...",
  "str_voice_1600264_62": "Good night...",
  "str_voice_1600264_63": "Going to bed already?",
  "str_voice_1600264_64": "Another day, another sunset...",
  "str_voice_1600264_65": "\"Look forward to tomorrow\"? Show me how...",
  "str_voice_1600264_66": "I'm feeling pain in my chest again...",
  "str_voice_1600264_67": "I bought a gift for her as an apology...",
  "str_voice_1600264_68": "Do you remember what your parents look like?",
  "str_voice_1600264_69": "It feels more comfortable in your Colossus than in an anti-explosion barrel.",
  "str_voice_1600264_70": "Any good spellbooks you can recommend?",
  "str_voice_1600264_71": "A new potion will probably be ready soon!",
  "str_voice_1600271_1": "Hear the calling of my heart? It is inevitable. I will cherish this bond.",
  "str_voice_1600271_10": "Should I help this guy cheer up... Oh, sorry, I forgot that you can hear me.",
  "str_voice_1600271_11": "Supervision, rectification, error correction, and execution. When do I start working?",
  "str_voice_1600271_12": "Only those who share the same fate as me can hear this voice.",
  "str_voice_1600271_13": "Hmm? I was just meditating and didn't see you. Sorry.",
  "str_voice_1600271_14": "Aren't you afraid of getting close to me? ...Or are you like Raphael and aren't afraid of electric shocks?",
  "str_voice_1600271_15": "Today is an important day for you, so let's celebrate it. What are you interested in?",
  "str_voice_1600271_16": "Good day, Navigator. Any new commands?",
  "str_voice_1600271_17": "Good morning, I did everything you instructed me to do while you were asleep. Awaiting your new orders?",
  "str_voice_1600271_18": "Navigator, don't worry as I'm on standby and am ready for your instructions whenever.",
  "str_voice_1600271_19": "Good evening, and don't worry, because I'm always on standby for your commands... I remember I should say good night.",
  "str_voice_1600271_2": "The lightning and thunder scared off many and people refuse to listen to the words from behind my mask, but you are different, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1600271_20": "I will stay true to my path. My loyalty to Lumopolis stems from this.",
  "str_voice_1600271_21": "I am grateful for Raphael's treatment and to Illumina's help... along the course of my reborn.",
  "str_voice_1600271_22": "White Night up high.",
  "str_voice_1600271_23": "Give me the command and I'll annihilate them all.",
  "str_voice_1600271_24": "She didn't seem to hear me, but her incorporeal flames did dissipate at that time.",
  "str_voice_1600271_25": "She is someone from Illumina who seeks power. This feeling is... familiar—maybe that's the word I'm looking for to describe it.",
  "str_voice_1600271_26": "If I like something, it means I find it interesting.",
  "str_voice_1600271_27": "I've already bid farewell to everything I despise. I'll never look back.",
  "str_voice_1600271_28": "Navigator, the Colossus is gigantic, so don't just park it wherever you want.",
  "str_voice_1600271_29": "I'm Michael, the ruler of silent thunder and lightning. Whether you heard me or not, that's the end of my self-introduction. It's time to get to work.",

  "str_voice_1600281_6": "Ooh... These are all thank-you letters from the ones I healed! I've collected only a few of them throughout all these years, but I still get emotional every time I read them...",
  "str_voice_1600281_7": "Um, can I ask you a favor, Raphael? Just volunteer for my clinical trial, please! Hey, why are you backing up?",
  "str_voice_1600281_8": "Hey... This is the arm I accidentally removed from a patient last time... Would you be so kind as to give it back to her? Tee-hee...",
  "str_voice_1600281_9": "Anyone requiring medical attention here?! Who? Where?! Raphael and her Savior #5, ready for action! You're all safe now! I think?",

  "str_voice_1600291_12": "Hmm... What did Carleen tell me to do just now? I forgot.",
  "str_voice_1600291_13": "Oh-ho, what do you want? The wind already told me you were coming.",
  "str_voice_1600291_14": "You can tell me whatever you want and I'll listen... Huh? I really will listen.",

  "str_voice_1600291_2": "Photosynthesis in progress... I don't mean high school student! I'm already... Oops, I can't tell you my age, or else I'll have to silence you.",

  "str_voice_1600291_24": "He was just a naughty kid when I first arrived... Oh-ho, that's all I can say.",
  "str_voice_1600291_25": "Little Raphael does a good job with healing and her work, but her cooking skills are... Ahahah.",
  "str_voice_1600291_26": "It's best to have a nap next to the warm Sol Reactor, under the comfortable sun.",
  "str_voice_1600291_27": "Hmm... How does disliking feel like? I can't quite remember.",
  "str_voice_1600291_28": "Oh-ho, the first time I saw it, I thought it looked a little like my cage.",
  "str_voice_1600291_29": "Oh-ho, so you're the rumored... I'm Gabriel. Nothing else matters... We still have a long time together ahead of us, as long as a spring afternoon...",
  "str_voice_1600291_3": "Done for the day! Thanks to the help of the mounty. Oh! Speaking of which, he left me a message, but he was just swearing at me the whole time. Hahaha...",
  "str_voice_1600291_30": "Why do you have to be in such a hurry?",
  "str_voice_1600291_31": "The cage... is trembling.",
  "str_voice_1600291_32": "The memories are growing—",
  "str_voice_1600291_33": "The cage vanished...",
  "str_voice_1600291_34": "It's so boisterous!",
  "str_voice_1600291_35": "Spring is coming.",
  "str_voice_1600291_36": "It's up to you now, my emissary—",
  "str_voice_1600291_37": "Grow as wantonly as you like!",
  "str_voice_1600291_38": "Blow away! Fresh spring breeze!",
  "str_voice_1600291_39": "Oh, sorry?",
  "str_voice_1600291_4": "The cage... is there to protect you more than to imprison me... Oh-ho, what am I saying...",
  "str_voice_1600291_40": "Unforgivable!",
  "str_voice_1600291_41": "Oh-ho, I should lead by example sometimes.",
  "str_voice_1600291_42": "The most important thing is to be happy.",
  "str_voice_1600291_43": "Oh-ho, we lost. Shall we go back for a cup of tea?",
  "str_voice_1600291_44": "Wanna nap together? Sleeping feels really comfy! Just empty your head and zone out...",
  "str_voice_1600291_45": "Is this for me? No, I don't dislike it...",
  "str_voice_1600291_46": "Oh-ho! This is interesting! I'm feeling more alive now.",
  "str_voice_1600291_47": "Thanks, it's a nice gift!",
  "str_voice_1600291_48": "Oh-ho! Um, how did you know I liked this best?",
  "str_voice_1600291_49": "I experienced that war, but I don't really know what happened. Did it happen? I think so... I'm having a minor headache now.",
  "str_voice_1600291_5": "I can't shake the feeling that there's someone who looks really familiar here. Oh, I'm not referring to you... You're more than just familiar to me. Ahhh... Thinking is such a draining exercise...",
  "str_voice_1600291_50": "The cage was broken before... but I think someone mended it afterwards. Who was it? It was someone familiar. Oh, I just can't remember.",
  "str_voice_1600291_51": "Don't look back. There's nothing except for misty gray smoke and cold iron edges. Maybe you'll help me remember everything one day...",
  "str_voice_1600291_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1600291_53": "Hello there!",
  "str_voice_1600291_54": "I was accidentally awakened by the sun!",
  "str_voice_1600291_55": "I love the afternoon sun today.",
  "str_voice_1600291_56": "Since I'm still awake...",
  "str_voice_1600291_57": "Oh-ho, Happy New Year!",
  "str_voice_1600291_6": "The wind, forest, and time blowing from the past...my memories are reviving and flying out of this splendid prison!",
  "str_voice_1600291_7": "You seem to care about me a lot. I've passed on all the work Carleen gave me to the kid, so we can chat properly!",
  "str_voice_1600291_8": "I have a gift for you! It's... Oh-ho, it isn't here. Sorry, my memory is slipping—my memory, is slipping...",
  "str_voice_1600291_9": "I've been thinking... It won't matter if I open the cage for you slightly, right? But what if that incident repeats... Hmm? What happened before? I suddenly forgot.",
  "str_voice_1600301_1": "The Lumopolis Caravan figured it out, they're shipping empty crates now. We'll need to study their tracks to confirm if they have goods before we make our move.",
  "str_voice_1600301_10": "I'd rather you lock me up than make me sit around here with nothing to do... That's right, I'm talkin' to you!",
  "str_voice_1600301_11": "You're... making me stand guard? Damn, no racing, no fighting, just standing here? Ah whatever, I'm down.",
  "str_voice_1600301_12": "If you can't settle things with your fists, try a cannon instead! Can't do that either? Then let me go and give 'em a piece of my mind!",
  "str_voice_1600301_13": "Eat, sleep, and live... Each of us has our own battle to fight, one that others can't understand.",
  "str_voice_1600301_14": "Hey, speed up, Colossus! Where's the accelerator? How do I switch gears?",
  "str_voice_1600301_15": "Yo! Happy birthday! I forgot to get you anything, but... Alright boys, get out there and nab something nice for our dear Navigator!",
  "str_voice_1600301_16": "Battle? The weather's perfect for me to really swing my mecha arm!",
  "str_voice_1600301_17": "You're up? I really envy people who can fall asleep whenever they want...",
  "str_voice_1600301_18": "Night has fallen, and all are asleep. Those mice are crawling out as the darkness descending!",
  "str_voice_1600301_19": "Can't get any sleep either, eh? C'mon, let's go grab some late-night snacks! My treat!",
  "str_voice_1600301_2": "Listen up, kid. Next time, you throw this in the recycling bin. Got it?",
  "str_voice_1600301_20": "Don't judge us by our ragtag appearance. You won't find a family more united and dependable than the Rediesel Wrench!",
  "str_voice_1600301_21": "No matter what, I just can't seem to like those officers. There's too much bad history...",
  "str_voice_1600301_22": "Live life to the fullest!",
  "str_voice_1600301_23": "These stupid bugs are such a pain, and we can't even eat them! I wish they'd go back to where they came from...",
  "str_voice_1600301_24": "I remember when she could still make that carefree smile. Back then, neither of us knew how cruel life could be.",
  "str_voice_1600301_25": "Some of them are really dependable, but their taste in music is, uh... Ahem, forget I said anything.",
  "str_voice_1600301_26": "Robbin' and racin', those are my greatest passions in life! Is it shallow? There's nothing wrong with being a little shallow!",
  "str_voice_1600301_27": "Ever seen people get so mad that they crush an entire mountain? Well, if anyone ever hurts my family, you'll get a front-row seat to the show.",
  "str_voice_1600301_28": "Whoa, it's nice and bright here! I claim this place in the name of the Rediesel Wrench! Anyone got a problem with that?",
  "str_voice_1600301_29": "Welcome to the Rediesel Desert, kid. Feel how the wind just changed? Don't worry, it isn't a sandstorm, it's just the mountains breathing.",
  "str_voice_1600301_3": "Books? I've already given 'em to the boys. I'm planning to test 'em on it! You've put in some magazines with those books, eh? That's fine, I'll test on 'em, too!",
  "str_voice_1600301_30": "I'm all fired up!",
  "str_voice_1600301_31": "Aha! Damn, I'm good!",
  "str_voice_1600301_32": "Faster! I can go even faster!",
  "str_voice_1600301_33": "Here comes the King of the Desert!",
  "str_voice_1600301_34": "Hurry up!",
  "str_voice_1600301_35": "My blood's boiling!",
  "str_voice_1600301_36": "Where's the fight?",
  "str_voice_1600301_37": "All of you, behave!",
  "str_voice_1600301_38": "Are you lost?!",
  "str_voice_1600301_39": "Shatter!",
  "str_voice_1600301_4": "Just say what you want. Why do I have a strange name like Sinsa? Your name's not exactly normal-sounding either, you know...",
  "str_voice_1600301_40": "Get fired up!!",
  "str_voice_1600301_41": "Just follow my lead!",
  "str_voice_1600301_42": "Sweet! Are we done warming up now?",
  "str_voice_1600301_43": "Hahaha! Scars are signs of a real man!",
  "str_voice_1600301_44": "Your Colossus is freakin' amazing... It's taking all my strength just to keep from robbing the place!",
  "str_voice_1600301_45": "Is this a token of your thoughtfulness?",
  "str_voice_1600301_46": "Hey! You got a good taste, kid!",
  "str_voice_1600301_47": "Ha! This is way better than the stuff I've been swiping lately!",
  "str_voice_1600301_48": "Whoa! This is just what I wanted! Thanks!!",
  "str_voice_1600301_49": "I'm... not exactly on the best terms with the Illumina folks. I don't feel like talkin' about it now, but you'll find out soon enough.",
  "str_voice_1600301_5": "Wanna see my wrench? I only let a few trusted people use it... Huh? Oh, in this case, my trust is not related to justice or something. I need someone who can hold it up because it weighs a ton.",
  "str_voice_1600301_50": "Have you gotten used to the Rediesel Wrench lifestyle yet? If not, it's fine, we don't really care. Astra's so big and yet so small. It's so small that the Rediesel Desert is the only place we'd ever call home!",
  "str_voice_1600301_51": "That's right, Eve's my younger sister. We've been through some rough times, but those times only strengthen our bond. I just hope luck favors you too, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1600301_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1600301_53": "You there, kid?",
  "str_voice_1600301_54": "Get up, kid!",
  "str_voice_1600301_55": "Time to work up a sweat!",
  "str_voice_1600301_56": "Go to bed now.",
  "str_voice_1600301_57": "Happy New Year! We're gonna train so hard that even your six-pack will have six-packs! Haha!",
  "str_voice_1600301_6": "\"People may lie, but fists don't deceive. Beat someone up, and the truth you'll receive!\" That's great, and it's kinda catchy! Eat your heart out, Charon!",
  "str_voice_1600301_7": "I like talking loudly, why not? You're supposed to laugh when you're happy and swear when you're pissed, right?",
  "str_voice_1600301_8": "Still don't have a battle plan, eh? Make it up as we go? Hahaha, as expected of the Navigator! Let our weapons decide our strategy!",
  "str_voice_1600301_9": "I trust everyone in the Rediesel Wrench with my life. As for you... Yeah, you're as reliable as one of them, too! So, when are you gonna join us over here?",
  "str_voice_1600381_1": "The ruined of the testing ground remind me of how extraordinary the results of that bygone era were. I have indeed made a mistake, but failure is the mother of success, isn't it?",
  "str_voice_1600381_10": "Steadfast cavalry, unfallible tactics, raw military might! We shall fight on the beaches... Tsk, back to my bad habits again. Need to remember what age I am!",
  "str_voice_1600381_11": "As a researcher, you should look more from the outside in. It might give you a different perspective.",
  "str_voice_1600381_12": "The games here aren't that bad either, like operating the Colossus... What? It's not a game?",
  "str_voice_1600381_13": "It is truly amazing that, with a clear mind, one can make the outside world feel both strange and new again.",
  "str_voice_1600381_14": "A dungeon in the \"World\" has been updated. Wanna take on the challenge?",
  "str_voice_1600381_15": "Here's your entry into the Emperor's Cup! Beat me, my throne is yours!",
  "str_voice_1600381_16": "Look who's here—the loser!",
  "str_voice_1600381_17": "No more talking and do the rock-paper-scissors! Ha, you lost!",
  "str_voice_1600381_18": "So have you decided how you're gonna challenge me, loser?",
  "str_voice_1600381_19": "Cheer up. To a researcher, the game has just begun!",
  "str_voice_1600381_2": "The tragedies of the world are none of my business, and I don't want to fake sympathy. Illumina is actually quite fun, isn't it?",
  "str_voice_1600381_20": "Illumina is researchers' paradise. We'll develop even more awesome stuffs. You'll see.",
  "str_voice_1600381_21": "That Raphael Lumopolis sent is quite the researcher, but she's nowhere near my standard.",
  "str_voice_1600381_22": "Splendor Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1600381_23": "The extensive research into them is paused for the moment... I'll be more careful next time.",
  "str_voice_1600381_24": "The current Grand Marshal is the best. Sometimes I even feel that she's more like a boss in a game.",
  "str_voice_1600381_25": "Loser! That's quite a brag for someone so young. He's no match for me in terms of machine operation skills.",
  "str_voice_1600381_26": "Things I like? Games, researches, old machineries, and the champion's throne.",
  "str_voice_1600381_27": "I'm sure the world would be a very unpleasant place without fun games!",
  "str_voice_1600381_28": "Mechanical technology, biotechnology, Aurorian technology... Perhaps the Colossus is the perfect creation.",
  "str_voice_1600381_29": "You have an aura similar to mine. Have we met before? Or have you participated in the Emperor's Cup before? In that case, you must know me!",
  "str_voice_1600381_3": "My vehicle is a relic from a long time ago, something that could only have been built with a complete disregard for process and cost. I've really hit the jackpot!",
  "str_voice_1600381_30": "Cleared! Phew!",
  "str_voice_1600381_31": "The supreme power of the Age of Fear is awake!",
  "str_voice_1600381_32": "No one can drag me out of this throne!",
  "str_voice_1600381_33": "Regret opposing me now!",
  "str_voice_1600381_34": "There's such a huge score difference between the first and second place!",
  "str_voice_1600381_35": "Let me have some fun!",
  "str_voice_1600381_36": "A new record is about to be made!",
  "str_voice_1600381_37": "Game start!",
  "str_voice_1600381_38": "Wanna tap and try?",
  "str_voice_1600381_39": "Megashock!",
  "str_voice_1600381_4": "I'm not bound by rules! I bet my life as a researcher that I will find the answer!",
  "str_voice_1600381_40": "Mecha skill!",
  "str_voice_1600381_41": "Game start! I'm with Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1600381_42": "That was fun! Let's go again, let's go again!",
  "str_voice_1600381_43": "Is there such a rule? Damn...",
  "str_voice_1600381_44": "Have you finally made up your mind? Can I play with your Colossus?",
  "str_voice_1600381_45": "Let me guess. Is it a new game or an enhancement card?",
  "str_voice_1600381_46": "I've never seen anything so interesting at Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1600381_47": "Let me guess. You've come up with some new gameplay?",
  "str_voice_1600381_48": "You know what I like to play!",
  "str_voice_1600381_49": "This power seemed to have failed to protect the era that created it, and now that I have rediscovered it, can it protect our era?",
  "str_voice_1600381_5": "Do you want to count my victories? You see, no matter the game, my score always tops the leaderboard.",
  "str_voice_1600381_50": "Perhaps one day this era will fall in the same way as those ancient empires, but these games will go on until the winner is determined.",
  "str_voice_1600381_51": "My memory of the experiment is intact, but I don't want to share this useless knowledge with you. I can tell from your flabbergasted look that you are still at the inexperienced stage.",
  "str_voice_1600381_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1600381_53": "C'mon!",
  "str_voice_1600381_54": "C'mon! The game has started!",
  "str_voice_1600381_55": "Right on time. Let's battle!",
  "str_voice_1600381_56": "Don't get sleepy!",
  "str_voice_1600381_57": "Cleared for a year, here comes another year!",
  "str_voice_1600381_6": "The Throne is a relic of a distant age, and only those who \"first understood\" the secrets it contains are entitled to use it.",
  "str_voice_1600381_7": "My job is to clear the stages, and nothing else has anything to do with me, right? After all, everyone has their own stages to clear.",
  "str_voice_1600381_8": "The giant crater in that realm is a spectacle indeed. I wish I had time to go and have a look, but it looks like the place has been taken over by a bunch of hobos.",
  "str_voice_1600381_9": "We are all children abandoned by civilization... You really don't know anything about that era? Oh well, it's not surprising. After all, none of those things are recorded in the literatures open to the public.",
  "str_voice_1600384_10": "What are you doing? If this goes on, I'm gonna get bored. PlayerName, look over here!",
  "str_voice_1600384_11": "Huh? Are we playing some sort of aquarium pretend game? I'm playing an aquarium fish and you're playing a visitor on the other side of the glass... Hee hee. Sounds pretty interesting!",
  "str_voice_1600384_16": "It's time to investigate potential strategies. Hmm. You *are* here to play games with me, aren't you?",
  "str_voice_1600384_17": "Darn it. I spent the whole night and almost passed the game!!\nBut I must go to the research lab and share the research result I got yesterday afternoon...",
  "str_voice_1600384_18": "I tried to cook the dish mentioned in the game. Ahem, as for the result... I shall leave those things in the game world.",
  "str_voice_1600384_19": "You're still online too? Wow! This is a great time to improve ranks!",
  "str_voice_1600384_35": "A brand new Gronru!",
  "str_voice_1600384_36": "Here I am!",
  "str_voice_1600384_37": "Tap this button to release the ultimate skill!",
  "str_voice_1600384_38": "The—highest—level!",
  "str_voice_1600384_39": "You're going down!",
  "str_voice_1600384_40": "You lost!",
  "str_voice_1600384_44": "You like my new skin? Hee hee. Thanks.",
  "str_voice_1600384_58": "The fish follow you like sidekicks follow protagonists in games. Huh? So you're the partner and I'm the protagonist this time?",
  "str_voice_1600384_59": "Can you get closer? Closer, closer... Watch out! That's the closest you can get, or we might switch positions. Are you interested in seeing what it feels like in here?",
  "str_voice_1600384_60": "No matter how hard a game is, you'll manage to pass it after a few tries. If someone is willing to spend even more time, they get those \"Perfect Rewards\" quite easily... You don't think it's that easy? Well, it's still much easier than things in the real world, isn't it?",
  "str_voice_1600384_61": "Although this outfit exposes too much of my skin, I think if I were to wear it to the research lab, the first person to blush upon seeing it would be Unimet.",
  "str_voice_1600384_62": "To me, doing research is just as simple as playing games because both things have concrete solutions. That's right. Questions with answers are always easier to deal with.",
  "str_voice_1600384_63": "Sometimes I go back to games I completed a long time ago... Probably because I can't let go of all the effort I went to finishing them or the emotions I invested in them.",
  "str_voice_1600384_64": "Morning...",
  "str_voice_1600384_65": "Good morning! Do you like the sea?",
  "str_voice_1600384_66": "Morning! I'm going to the testing grounds with Siobhan today!",
  "str_voice_1600384_67": "Morning! I've already started working.",
  "str_voice_1600384_68": "Leave a message if you need anything! If I don't reply, it means I'm working.",
  "str_voice_1600384_69": "Guess what I'm having for lunch?",
  "str_voice_1600384_70": "Hey! Good afternoon! I tried a game from a new genre today!",
  "str_voice_1600384_71": "I need to rest well this noon.",
  "str_voice_1600384_72": "What should I do during noon break today?",
  "str_voice_1600384_73": "It's this time again!",
  "str_voice_1600384_74": "Hee hee. I had a wonderful supper!",
  "str_voice_1600384_75": "Darn, darn, darn, screw this! I lost!",
  "str_voice_1600384_76": "*sniff* ... The plot of the game I finished today was so touching...",
  "str_voice_1600384_77": "What do you think about before sleeping every night?",
  "str_voice_1600601_1": "Don't be shy, come and say hi. We got warheads, magazines, shell casings, oh, this is the \"Doom\" series robotic arm! Designed by the Rediesel Wrench technical division. How is it made? Well, you can just go ask Tiny One.",
  "str_voice_1600601_10": "Relax—you should enjoy your leisure time properly. Leave your work matters for later.",
  "str_voice_1600601_11": "If you pay me enough—ahem, yes, I'll do it.",
  "str_voice_1600601_12": "Bang! Did I scare you? Haha!",
  "str_voice_1600601_13": "To be polite, I guess I should shake your hand—which of my robotic arms do you want to shake?",
  "str_voice_1600601_14": "A wanted criminal? Even I'm tempted by the price on my head.",
  "str_voice_1600601_15": "Hey kid, it's your birthday today. Isn't that great? It's a lucky day worth celebrating.",
  "str_voice_1600601_16": "Let's get a move on, been a while since I got any action. Try to keep up with my pace, kid.",
  "str_voice_1600601_17": "A nice long breakfast is the perfect start to a good day, especially when it comes with a cup of tea.",
  "str_voice_1600601_18": "Who's making that racket?! Why do music lovers always get so restless around this time?",
  "str_voice_1600601_19": "You want a drink? On the rocks, with salt, or just a juice box for the kid?",
  "str_voice_1600601_2": "No one will say no to money, kid. This is just a job, and out of humanitarian spirit, I like to end lives quickly. Make sure there's no unnecessary suffering.",
  "str_voice_1600601_20": "Rediesel Wrench is a garbage dump where madmen and thugs gather. I'm one of them, of course.",
  "str_voice_1600601_21": "Lumopolis is great! They love squandering the legacy of the old world. Lot of hotties in the Lumo Knights, too.",
  "str_voice_1600601_22": "Live life to the fullest and just go with the flow.",
  "str_voice_1600601_23": "The Eclipsites? Those pitiful creatures who live on Darkflow to survive should all be put to rest sooner.",
  "str_voice_1600601_24": "Regina and Barbara? Oh, that's a tough choice since I like both rock music and pretty girls.",
  "str_voice_1600601_25": "Although Brock is a muscle-brained idiot, he is considered a normal person in Rediesel Wrench.",
  "str_voice_1600601_26": "Observing and strolling can calm my mind. What about Aurorians? They're no more than sand in the desert.",
  "str_voice_1600601_27": "A tense atmosphere always reminds me of stinky sweat. What's the point of forcing yourself so much?",
  "str_voice_1600601_28": "It's a magnificent creation. Just give me a corner to stay in and I'll be able to bid farewell to deprivation and hunger.",
  "str_voice_1600601_29": "Don't move or this bullet will rip through your head before you know it! I'm just kidding! I'm Jona, an ordinary gunner who is passing by. Say goodbye to those annoying trivial things in life; let us sit down and have a peaceful conversation.",
  "str_voice_1600601_3": "My MO? Helping the weak and women, especially children. I'll never point my guns at 'em.",
  "str_voice_1600601_30": "Keep a low profile.",
  "str_voice_1600601_31": "One shot, right on target!",
  "str_voice_1600601_32": "My talent is shooting.",
  "str_voice_1600601_33": "Come, listen to this symphony of gunshots!",
  "str_voice_1600601_34": "Let's get'em, boys!",
  "str_voice_1600601_35": "Locked and loaded.",
  "str_voice_1600601_36": "Take aim.",
  "str_voice_1600601_37": "Eat lead!",
  "str_voice_1600601_38": "Adios, amigo.",
  "str_voice_1600601_39": "Good things come in pairs.",
  "str_voice_1600601_4": "Alright, time for the gloves to come off—Hah! I'm just joking. I won't undo my handcuffs. They're kinda my thing.",
  "str_voice_1600601_40": "No survivors.",
  "str_voice_1600601_41": "Prepare coffins for my enemies.",
  "str_voice_1600601_42": "Huh, it's nothing much.",
  "str_voice_1600601_43": "Watch out for sneaky shots.",
  "str_voice_1600601_44": "I almost forgot that I still have something to do. I'll end this quickly.",
  "str_voice_1600601_45": "Oh? ...Hmm, this is new and quite refreshing.",
  "str_voice_1600601_46": "Thanks! I'll treasure this.",
  "str_voice_1600601_47": "Ammo, wine glasses, and your gift.",
  "str_voice_1600601_48": "An equivalent exchange. This gift is worth a glass of cold beer!",
  "str_voice_1600601_49": "Life? I don't have any special expectations for life... Tomorrow is just another day. I don't care where I am as long as I have something to eat.",
  "str_voice_1600601_5": "Be careful, kid. My bullets are fast enough to send people to their graves.",
  "str_voice_1600601_50": "The life of a gunner ends in a duel. Obviously, my gun is always faster. Buried my mentor myself and covered the ground in bullet shells for him.",
  "str_voice_1600601_51": "I've always allowed fate to push me around and stay where I'm pushed to. If I had to say something good about it, at least Rediesel Wrench is where I've lived most comfortably.",
  "str_voice_1600601_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1600601_53": "Guide.",
  "str_voice_1600601_54": "Oh, morning.",
  "str_voice_1600601_55": "Come over—it's time for some action.",
  "str_voice_1600601_56": "Squeak, let me know you're still alive.",
  "str_voice_1600601_57": "Sit down now. It's the New Year.",
  "str_voice_1600601_6": "Alright! Time to kick some butt. I can talk the talk because I walk the walk, kid.",
  "str_voice_1600601_7": "I don't like to fight... but sometimes you just don't have a choice. Tsk, don't make me reserve a bullet for you, kid.",
  "str_voice_1600601_8": "Before I die, I want to get drunk and collapse somewhere in the street. Then, some random nobody comes by and BLAM, does me in right there and then, one shot to the heart.",
  "str_voice_1600601_9": "I don't like to poke my nose in other people's business, usually, but you're special. Whatever happens to you, don't take it to heart. Time will smooth everything out.",
  "str_voice_1600641_1": "A fair and square victory is the only way to ultimate victory. Backstabbers will sooner or later get backstabbed.",
  "str_voice_1600641_10": "No missions to take on? Then, we shall meditate. It's also a kind of mental training.",
  "str_voice_1600641_11": "Copy that. I'll accept your request just so you would support me in the future.",
  "str_voice_1600641_12": "A Legion Commander can act leisurely on the surface, but should always be vigilant at heart.",
  "str_voice_1600641_13": "Electrical leakage from Richthofen? Oh, it's intentional. Don't worry. I'm in full control of it.",
  "str_voice_1600641_14": "Having a powerful weapon but not the means to use it is like a baby with a bar of gold wandering through the busy streets.",
  "str_voice_1600641_15": "Just this once, I'll use the Red Baron to cut your birthday cake for you.",
  "str_voice_1600641_16": "Stay vigilant! Always stay motivated!",
  "str_voice_1600641_17": "Morning! Work awaits!",
  "str_voice_1600641_18": "There's still some time before break time. Let's continue.",
  "str_voice_1600641_19": "I don't get tired. I can stay up for the whole day when necessary.",
  "str_voice_1600641_2": "The Red Baron should be unleashed from time to time to maintain tip-top condition.",
  "str_voice_1600641_20": "Be honest and upright—that's what Illumina Federation has taught me. That's why I have no hidden agenda.",
  "str_voice_1600641_21": "Lumopolis has no future because it's founded on royal houses and their lineages.",
  "str_voice_1600641_22": "Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1600641_23": "Eclipsites? There's nothing to be afraid of. They serve as foundations for my advancement.",
  "str_voice_1600641_24": "If you want to defeat Reinhardt, you have to first get through me.",
  "str_voice_1600641_25": "Vivian is perfect as a subordinate, but she's not suitable to lead.",
  "str_voice_1600641_26": "When power increases, so does status.",
  "str_voice_1600641_27": "Despicable schemers shall be crushed by justice even if it arrives late.",
  "str_voice_1600641_28": "If only I could have the Colossus in my legion... I would have an air force.",
  "str_voice_1600641_29": "The future Grand Marshal of Illumina, Wrath, is here. Support me, and you will see a bright future.",
  "str_voice_1600641_3": "A complete check-up of the Colossus is next on the list. I could be the one to bring out even more power from it.",
  "str_voice_1600641_30": "This is the power that I deserve.",
  "str_voice_1600641_31": "Roar! Richthofen!",
  "str_voice_1600641_32": "Speed up! Red Baron!",
  "str_voice_1600641_33": "Nothing can stand in my way!",
  "str_voice_1600641_34": "I should be the captain.",
  "str_voice_1600641_35": "Charge! Red Baron!",
  "str_voice_1600641_36": "Overcharge! Red Baron!",
  "str_voice_1600641_37": "Overcharge mode, activated!",
  "str_voice_1600641_38": "Thunderstrike! Red Baron!",
  "str_voice_1600641_39": "Richthofen!",
  "str_voice_1600641_4": "Fear drives the weak away but makes me stronger.",
  "str_voice_1600641_40": "Red Baron!",
  "str_voice_1600641_41": "I'm meant to be in this position.",
  "str_voice_1600641_42": "A piece of cake.",
  "str_voice_1600641_43": "Ugh, defeated by stress...",
  "str_voice_1600641_44": "Hmm... How should I control such a powerful Colossus?",
  "str_voice_1600641_45": "Well, you didn't have to.",
  "str_voice_1600641_46": "Good. I shall reconsider our relationship.",
  "str_voice_1600641_47": "Thanks. I will remember it.",
  "str_voice_1600641_48": "Your generosity touches me. I haven't felt that for a long time, so, thanks.",
  "str_voice_1600641_49": "I am the Legion Commander, not because of my bond with Reinhardt, but my merits on the battlefield.",
  "str_voice_1600641_5": "Power and status should be earned, not handed.",
  "str_voice_1600641_50": "I may have missed the final battle with the Eclipsites, but I did exterminate all the wandering Eclipsites! My accomplishment is no less than that of the other three Legion Commanders.",
  "str_voice_1600641_51": "Sometimes I do wonder if I could really replace Reinhardt. It was she who saved me when I was mortally wounded...",
  "str_voice_1600641_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1600641_53": "Navigator, please respond!",
  "str_voice_1600641_54": "This is Wrath calling!",
  "str_voice_1600641_55": "Do you read me?",
  "str_voice_1600641_56": "Requesting special call. Over.",
  "str_voice_1600641_57": "Cleared to New Year!",
  "str_voice_1600641_6": "You know my strength. I'll take on the missions that others fail to accomplish.",
  "str_voice_1600641_7": "People in power don't necessarily have to be better than everyone else. All they need is the courage to make tough decisions.",
  "str_voice_1600641_8": "Ambition is a ball of fire that burns the weak but guides the strong, like me.",
  "str_voice_1600641_9": "I shall one day become Illumina's Grand Marshal. When the time comes, my deputy shall be Reinhardt... or you.",
  "str_voice_1600771_1": "I've never seen a Colossus this perfect; it seems that... destiny has spoken.",
  "str_voice_1600771_10": "As the Northlord, I have very little leisurely time. It reminds me of my chaise lounge in the Winter Palace.",
  "str_voice_1600771_11": "When you're searching for your destiny, I can look after the Colossus for you.",
  "str_voice_1600771_12": "The situation now is vastly different from when I was in the Northland. Thankfully I can still handle it with ease.",
  "str_voice_1600771_13": "This Colossus may not be the only one in this world. It's not alone, neither... are you.",
  "str_voice_1600771_14": "Sometimes... I can hear the Colossus speak. It seems like he also has a desire to express himself.",
  "str_voice_1600771_15": "I can't recall my own birthday... but I still want to wish you a happy birthday.",
  "str_voice_1600771_16": "A peaceful day, just like how the Northland usually is.",
  "str_voice_1600771_17": "Come, bathe in this sunlight with me.",
  "str_voice_1600771_18": "Resting every once in a while will prepare you for the future. Have a cup of tea and take a break.",
  "str_voice_1600771_19": "I'm used to staying up. That's the sacrifice I must make as Queen of the North. You should rest.",
  "str_voice_1600771_2": "Ever since the Colossus rose to the sky and looked down on the living, I knew the world had been changed.",
  "str_voice_1600771_20": "We've frozen our destiny in the rootless mountains. Perhaps change is coming...",
  "str_voice_1600771_21": "Lumopolis is like the Northland without snow. Conservatism is like their snow mountains. It will be disastrous should there be an avalanche.",
  "str_voice_1600771_22": "For the North.",
  "str_voice_1600771_23": "Who is it that the Eclipsites call their mother?",
  "str_voice_1600771_24": "There's a reason why Nikinis is so cold. You don't know what she has been through.",
  "str_voice_1600771_25": "Although Carleen is a noble, she isn't arrogant. She was born for the real Lumopolis.",
  "str_voice_1600771_26": "Tea from the south, sunlight in winter. If the world stays this way, perhaps even I will enjoy it.",

  "str_voice_1600961_2": "I'm tapped out. Should I borrow some more from Ms. Sheol... But she's always leaning against the table, which annoys me.",
  "str_voice_1600961_20": "I don't like Umbraton, but I have no choice... I have to go through here to get to Lumopolis.",
  "str_voice_1600961_21": "Illumina is a great place. It's nice to see everyone working towards the same goal...",
  "str_voice_1600961_22": "I'm with Murky Water.",
  "str_voice_1600961_23": "Why do these things even exist...",
  "str_voice_1600961_24": "Areia's a mature child. She's really something. I want to help her as much as I can.",
  "str_voice_1600961_25": "If it wasn't for Ms. Sheol, I probably wouldn't have been able to survive in Umbraton.",
  "str_voice_1600961_26": "Cats are cute, especially the black ones! I just love their eyes...",
  "str_voice_1600961_27": "When I first arrived in Umbraton, I met a lot of bad guys who deceived me. I don't ever want to see them again.",
  "str_voice_1600961_28": "With this... I should be able to enter and exit Lumopolis at will...",
  "str_voice_1600961_29": "Hi, do you know Gabriel? The one who lives in Lumopolis...",
  "str_voice_1600961_3": "Life in Umbraton is rough. I'm beginning to miss my home in Illumina.",
  "str_voice_1600961_30": "Turbid Water's power has increased.",

  "str_voice_1600961_50": "Life was hard when I first came to Umbraton. All my money was swindled out of me. I can't imagine what would have become of me if I didn't meet Ms. Sheol...",
  "str_voice_1600961_51": "I must become stronger to control my power and prevent my senses from being devoured by it again.",
  "str_voice_1600961_52": "Hmm? Alchemy... Stars?",
  "str_voice_1600961_53": "Hello.",
  "str_voice_1600961_54": "What a lovely morning!",
  "str_voice_1600961_55": "Do you need a lunch break?",

  "str_voice_1600961_8": "I'll buy you coffee sometime... I assume you don't like bitter coffee, so I've prepared some sugar for you.",
  "str_voice_1600961_9": "Have you ever had this feeling before? The kind that makes you feel... that evil is gradually invading your mind and body. I fear I'm wasting too much time on things of no importance. I should utilize my power more efficiently! Ah... No, forget it.",
  "str_voice_1601031_1": "Look at this cute hourglass. I made it myself. What do you think?... I can do more than interrogating prisoners. Is that so surprising?",
  "str_voice_1601031_10": "I'm losing my reasons. I can feel it.",
  "str_voice_1601031_11": "You want me to do it... Since you insisted, I'll ask that you stand further away from me. I'm going to take off my eye patch.",
  "str_voice_1601031_12": "You know what it is I want to ask... Is Victoria here?",
  "str_voice_1601031_13": "Yes, I like blood a lot, but that doesn't mean I don't need my room to be clean and tidy.",
  "str_voice_1601031_14": "I wonder what sounds you'll make in the interrogation room. But I shouldn't, right?",
  "str_voice_1601031_15": "A birthday present? Would you like... a tour around my interrogation room?",
  "str_voice_1601031_16": "You're back... Huh? You want to know what I plan to do next? I have more work waiting for me in the interrogation room, of course.",
  "str_voice_1601031_17": "How wonderful it is... to hear such beautiful screams from the interrogation room first thing in the morning.",
  "str_voice_1601031_18": "Although I want to keep working, Victoria said it's important to get enough rest.",
  "str_voice_1601031_19": "Late-night interrogations always come with surprising discoveries... Huh? You're up, too?",
  "str_voice_1601031_2": "You wanna see the eye underneath the eye patch? Nobody ever requested that before... Are you serious?",
  "str_voice_1601031_20": "Truth... It's not something I care for much, but whatever Victoria's goal is, it is also mine.",
  "str_voice_1601031_21": "When faced with my right eye, even those from Lumopolis will be groaning in agony.",
  "str_voice_1601031_22": "Oh well, may the Truth bless you.",
  "str_voice_1601031_23": "Those things don't even deserve to be tried. Just execute them.",
  "str_voice_1601031_24": "Victoria is too soft and gentle. It's fine, leave the violence to me.",
  "str_voice_1601031_25": "I should have that guy who's always hanging around Victoria experience the Calamity.",
  "str_voice_1601031_26": "Blood, screams, the grimace of pain... So fantastic!",
  "str_voice_1601031_27": "Why are people always trying to discipline me? Victoria alone is enough for me.",
  "str_voice_1601031_28": "So many rooms here... I can use one as an interrogation room, can't I?",
  "str_voice_1601031_29": "How troublesome... I'm Eicy. Usually, I tell people my name only during interrogations. But, Victoria told me that introducing oneself is a common courtesy...",
  "str_voice_1601031_3": "You should know I'm skilled in making people cry. Of course, I mean when I'm executing people. What else could it be?",
  "str_voice_1601031_30": "Ha... That's it?",
  "str_voice_1601031_31": "Look right into the fear within!",
  "str_voice_1601031_32": "The Hollow Gaze is watching you.",
  "str_voice_1601031_33": "Experience the Abyss!",
  "str_voice_1601031_34": "Screams and blood...",
  "str_voice_1601031_35": "Hollow Gaze!",
  "str_voice_1601031_36": "Start the interrogation now?",
  "str_voice_1601031_37": "Look right into the Calamity!",
  "str_voice_1601031_38": "No one's getting away!",
  "str_voice_1601031_39": "Is it painful? Scream then!",
  "str_voice_1601031_4": "People often tell me I have a twisted sense of right and wrong. What's right then? Is it really that important to draw a line between good and evil? Can't I just do what makes me happy?",
  "str_voice_1601031_40": "Shiver!",
  "str_voice_1601031_41": "You want me to lead? They'll be screwed.",
  "str_voice_1601031_42": "Here's the taste of fear!",
  "str_voice_1601031_43": "I'm sorry, Victoria...",
  "str_voice_1601031_44": "Shh! Look into my eye and tell me what you've done.",
  "str_voice_1601031_45": "You don't seem to know me very well.",
  "str_voice_1601031_46": "How did you know I like this...",
  "str_voice_1601031_47": "I didn't expect you to think of this. I'm surprised...",
  "str_voice_1601031_48": "I never thought anyone besides Victoria would understand me so well!",
  "str_voice_1601031_49": "I come from a cursed bloodline... Anyone who makes direct eye contact with the Hollow Gaze sinks into fear and madness. My parents were no different, and lost their lives because of it.",
  "str_voice_1601031_5": "I'd thought the Colossus was an interesting place. Seems like it's a bit boring here. Have you got anyone that needs to be executed?",
  "str_voice_1601031_50": "Victoria made this eyepatch for me. It's an item used to inhibit the cursed power of the Hollow Gaze... You didn't know about it, did you?",
  "str_voice_1601031_51": "I don't mind having this power. Nor do I mind being the interrogator and the executor. After all, blood and groans fulfill me...",
  "str_voice_1601031_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1601031_53": "What are you doing?",
  "str_voice_1601031_54": "Were you sleeping the entire time I was in the interrogation room?",
  "str_voice_1601031_55": "Interrogating people stimulates the appetite. Wanna try it?",
  "str_voice_1601031_56": "I'm done for the day. Good night.",
  "str_voice_1601031_57": "A new year. Does it mean I'm getting an interrogation room at the Colossus?",
  "str_voice_1601031_6": "My Right Pupil can show you hell. I can also do that with my Taijutsu.",
  "str_voice_1601031_7": "Oh... You don't seem to know how dangerous I am, approaching me like this...",
  "str_voice_1601031_8": "I do love torturing people, but don't worry... With you, I'll be very gentle, for now.",
  "str_voice_1601031_9": "Since you're so curious... I'll just show you my staff... But be careful not to touch it. You're the only one whom I don't want to see cursed.",
  "str_voice_1601031_99": "How can a concert song sound better than screams in an interrogation room?",
  "str_voice_1601051_1": "3, 2, 1! Guess who? That's right, it's me, Eve! What are you up to? Anything I can help you with?",
  "str_voice_1601051_10": "Um, a-are you busy right now? If not... could you tell me more about you? And maybe... about the outside world?",
  "str_voice_1601051_11": "You're... trusting me with this? T-Thank you! I promise I'll do my best to not make any trouble. I... I think I can do this?",
  "str_voice_1601051_12": "I wish I could just hang around the Bridge the whole day... It's so beautiful out there.",
  "str_voice_1601051_13": "Hmm... So much to learn about, so little time. Where should I start?",
  "str_voice_1601051_14": "I'm really happy now. I never thought I would be able to live like this.",
  "str_voice_1601051_15": "Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!",
  "str_voice_1601051_16": "You're back... Did you do anything fun? Can you share it with me?",
  "str_voice_1601051_17": "So sleepy... You're up this early? That's so exhausting...",
  "str_voice_1601051_18": "Big brother's been awfully busy lately, too... I hope you're both getting enough rest.",
  "str_voice_1601051_19": "I... I need to sleep now. Remember to go to bed soon...",
  "str_voice_1601051_2": "I love my brother more than anything! If anyone were to hurt him... Oh, sorry about that, I won't let anyone hurt you, either!",
  "str_voice_1601051_20": "Rediesel Wrench is the greatest! There are lots of interesting people here, and my big brother too!",
  "str_voice_1601051_21": "I may not have the nicest memories of Illumina... But I know it's not Illumina's fault.",
  "str_voice_1601051_22": "What did my brother always say? Live life to the fullest?",
  "str_voice_1601051_23": "I can sense their presence and roars, but I'm definitely not with them, not at all...!",
  "str_voice_1601051_24": "H-Hold on, Dawn! I've already watered the flowers today!",
  "str_voice_1601051_25": "Joanie's fireworks are the best! Wait, aren't those... bombs?!",
  "str_voice_1601051_26": "Crafting, picnics, new clothes... These are all my favorite things! Oh, and this Colossus, too!",
  "str_voice_1601051_27": "Anyone who hurts big brother is a bad person... That goes for me, too... Right?",
  "str_voice_1601051_28": "I love riding on the Colossus! I can see so many wonderful places from up here!",
  "str_voice_1601051_29": "Let me try that again... M-My name's Eve, and I'm Sinsa's younger sister. N... *Coughs* Nice to meet you. I know I made trouble for everyone before... But I'm all better now! Ta-da! See?",
  "str_voice_1601051_3": "Ah! S-Something just flew by outside! Was it a bird? No, it kinda looked like a Colossus... Oh, it was just a courier...",
  "str_voice_1601051_30": "I have to be careful with my power...",
  "str_voice_1601051_31": "I can hear... those sounds...",
  "str_voice_1601051_32": "I have better control over myself and thunder and lightning now.",
  "str_voice_1601051_33": "I... I have to protect my big brother!",
  "str_voice_1601051_34": "I-I can do it!",
  "str_voice_1601051_35": "I'm fine now!",
  "str_voice_1601051_36": "Can we start now?",
  "str_voice_1601051_37": "Those roars are familiar—",
  "str_voice_1601051_38": "Through the cloud—",
  "str_voice_1601051_39": "Flash!",
  "str_voice_1601051_4": "I heard an Eclipsite's roar just now... It reminds me of what happened back then... No, I can't let my fear win! I won't be afraid anymore! *Coughs* I'm fine now, see? Perfectly fine!",
  "str_voice_1601051_40": "Spark!",
  "str_voice_1601051_41": "Me? I... I can do it!",
  "str_voice_1601051_42": "I did it?!",
  "str_voice_1601051_43": "I failed to protect everyone...",
  "str_voice_1601051_44": "This place is beautiful!\nWay better than where I used to be at!",
  "str_voice_1601051_45": "Mm... Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1601051_46": "Is this for me? I really like it, thanks!",
  "str_voice_1601051_47": "It's not what I had in mind... But thanks!",
  "str_voice_1601051_48": "You always know exactly what I want!",
  "str_voice_1601051_49": "When I was in quarantine, I would hear the roars of Eclipsites every night and be terrified... But the folks in the Rediesel Wrench would always comfort me and remind me that I wasn't alone...",
  "str_voice_1601051_5": "That power... It was like lightning surging through my veins: scary, but incredible... I felt like I could do anything! But I knew... no matter what I couldn't lose control again.",
  "str_voice_1601051_50": "You're such an idiot, Dawn... That's nothing but a flower, how can you say that it's more important than your own life...",
  "str_voice_1601051_51": "My big brother suffered so much because of me... This was always my burden to carry, not his. That's why I'll give my all to protect him with everyone!",
  "str_voice_1601051_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1601051_53": "Hey, you!",
  "str_voice_1601051_54": "G-Good morning...",
  "str_voice_1601051_55": "Hmm... What's for lunch?",
  "str_voice_1601051_56": "Get some rest soon, okay?",
  "str_voice_1601051_57": "Happy New Year! I wish you peace and happiness all year long!",
  "str_voice_1601051_6": "I remember how much my brother suffered because of me... I could never escape from my past mistakes, and I don't intend to... That's why I'm going to do whatever I can to ease his burden, starting with his chores!",
  "str_voice_1601051_7": "You really are kind... *Coughs* If you really want to do something nice for me, why not join the Rediesel Wrench? Hahaha, just kidding!",
  "str_voice_1601051_8": "I made a really good friend recently who treats me and the other friends so well... Can you guess who that is? I'll give you a hint: one who knows how to pilot a Colossus!",
  "str_voice_1601051_9": "Even though my brother will always be the most important person to me, I guess you can be the second... or tied with Dawn as the second important!",
  "str_voice_1601054_10": "Do you have any plans for today? The weather looks nice outside—why don't we go out there and have some fun?",
  "str_voice_1601054_11": "Everyone at the Rediesel Wrench feels like family to me... Hehe, you give me that feeling too, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1601054_16": "The world is so big—you can't waste your time with your head in the clouds! Where are we going next? I've always wanted to go to Northland.",
  "str_voice_1601054_17": "I don't know what my brother and everyone at the Rediesel Wrench are doing right now... Hmn! I need to pluck up and work harder to help you, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1601054_18": "Hmm? Are you looking for me? I've packed everything for the picnic... When are we leaving?",
  "str_voice_1601054_19": "In the end, the princess awakened from her nightmare, and the prince and all her loved ones were right there by her side... Yeah! I really like this ending!",
  "str_voice_1601054_35": "Well, I am still a girl, you know! Of course I like all kinds of pretty clothes! So, Navigator... got any suggestions?",
  "str_voice_1601054_36": "The grass smells so nice, the sun feels so warm... Ah... I feel like I'm about to fall asleep.",
  "str_voice_1601054_37": "I've been waiting for you for so long, Navigator! Where are we gonna play today?",
  "str_voice_1601054_38": "*Yawn* Sorry, I still feel like I just woke up... My brother said that if I don't sleep well, I won't grow taller...",
  "str_voice_1601054_39": "Good evening! Today's been a busy day. I made you a cup of tea, Navigator! Drink it up!",
  "str_voice_1601054_40": "Yaaaaawn... Navigator, do you ever count sheep when you can't sleep? How about counting fireflies...? One firefly... two fireflies... three fireflies... four fireflies...",
  "str_voice_1601054_44": "Ready when you are.",
  "str_voice_1601054_58": "Let's do this!",
  "str_voice_1601054_59": "I have to protect everyone!",
  "str_voice_1601054_60": "Eliminate the threat!",
  "str_voice_1601054_61": "This might hurt!",
  "str_voice_1601054_62": "You weren't invited!",
  "str_voice_1601054_63": "I brought some really pretty flowers with me. You can place them around the Colossus to make it look nicer.",
  "str_voice_1601054_64": "Coming out to play?",
  "str_voice_1601054_65": "Are you sure you won't reconsider joining the Rediesel Wrench?!",
  "str_voice_1601054_66": "I'm so happy because I have my brother, you, and everyone else by my side always.",
  "str_voice_1601054_67": "I can't waste any more time! I still have so many places I want to go with you, Navigator!",
  "str_voice_1601054_68": "I need your help again today, Navigator!",
  "str_voice_1601054_69": "Erm... actually, I've been learning how to cook recently. Maybe you can give my food a try when you have time?",
  "str_voice_1601054_70": "I haven't lost control of my power recently, and it's all thanks to you, Navigator!",
  "str_voice_1601054_71": "Having a picnic with you is just the best, Navigator!",
  "str_voice_1601054_72": "My brother always says we need to \"live life to the fullest,\" so let's take a break from work and go out and play!",
  "str_voice_1601054_73": "Do you like tea or coffee, Navigator? I'm gonna make you some in advance before the next picnic.",
  "str_voice_1601054_74": "Hmm? Navigator, where's all your spunk gone today...? Want me to tell you a story I heard from my brother?",
  "str_voice_1601111_1": "Don't look at my eyes. This isn't the most flattering of looks...",
  "str_voice_1601111_10": "The clouds are so beautiful... It's nice to not to think or worry about anything for once.",
  "str_voice_1601111_11": "Why do you want me to stand here? Well, I'll do as you say...",
  "str_voice_1601111_12": "People fail to understand each other because their joys and sorrows are worlds apart.",
  "str_voice_1601111_13": "No... Don't ask about my family. I don't have one...",
  "str_voice_1601111_14": "If I didn't need them to fight, I'd have these crystals removed from my body, no matter how dangerous that might be...",
  "str_voice_1601111_15": "Oh... Happy birthday.",
  "str_voice_1601111_16": "I wonder what kind of day we'll have today. Well, with you around, I know it won't be boring.",
  "str_voice_1601111_17": "The sun is so bright... Don't you think?",
  "str_voice_1601111_18": "Is it evening already? Oh, well...",
  "str_voice_1601111_19": "Another day has come and gone...",
  "str_voice_1601111_2": "Well, you do have that ability... Perhaps you can understand my pain. If so, that will be good, I guess.",
  "str_voice_1601111_20": "Can the way of the True Order save me? Only time will tell...",
  "str_voice_1601111_21": "Lumopolis has forgotten me, and I no longer miss it. Anyway, only nobles are welcome there...",
  "str_voice_1601111_22": "May the Truth protect you...",
  "str_voice_1601111_23": "The unfortunate among us... They're bound by their own chains, aren't they?",
  "str_voice_1601111_24": "Faust is scary sometimes, but without him, I would've turned into a giant crystal already...",
  "str_voice_1601111_25": "I can feel Eicy's pain, but she's so full of life that I find myself envying her...",
  "str_voice_1601111_26": "Faust's White Suitcase is amazing; it healed my pain. It is truly a gift from the heavens...",
  "str_voice_1601111_27": "Although it can protect me, it will also devour me... If possible, I should leave it well alone.",
  "str_voice_1601111_28": "The Colossus? It is indeed worthy of its name. But what I care about more is the Navigator commanding it...",
  "str_voice_1601111_29": "I'm Beryl. Don't be frightened by my Sanguine Crystal; it won't hurt you...",
  "str_voice_1601111_3": "It seems you possess some kind of special ability. Do you think you could erase my memory?",
  "str_voice_1601111_30": "Camellias are even more beautiful.",

  "str_voice_1601111_33": "Maybe... I can get rid of it?",
  "str_voice_1601111_34": "Will you accompany me?",
  "str_voice_1601111_35": "The crystals are gathering.",
  "str_voice_1601111_36": "They're coming.",
  "str_voice_1601111_37": "Field!",
  "str_voice_1601111_38": "Sanguine Crystal!",
  "str_voice_1601111_39": "Crystallus Camellias!",
  "str_voice_1601111_4": "Don't be afraid of my crystals. I won't let them harm you.",
  "str_voice_1601111_40": "Bloom!",
  "str_voice_1601111_41": "Let's go together.",
  "str_voice_1601111_42": "We won? Good...",
  "str_voice_1601111_43": "Hmph... A loss is a loss...",
  "str_voice_1601111_44": "Thank you for your concern... I feel much better, now.",
  "str_voice_1601111_45": "Why did you give me this?",
  "str_voice_1601111_46": "So, you knew I had my eye on this...",
  "str_voice_1601111_47": "Thank you...",
  "str_voice_1601111_48": "I never would've guessed that you knew me so well...",
  "str_voice_1601111_49": "I used to be a noble of Lumopolis, but now I can never go back.",
  "str_voice_1601111_5": "This flower-like crystal... It was the first Sanguine Crystal to grow from my skin...",
  "str_voice_1601111_50": "A family of fanatics snatched me and implanted this sanguine crystal in my body... I wasn't born with it.",
  "str_voice_1601111_51": "If I could turn back time, I would rather have been killed by the sanguine crystal than let my relatives suffer...",

  "str_voice_1601111_56": "It seems a little late in the day.",
  "str_voice_1601111_57": "I hope I can find someone who can understand me in the New Year.",
  "str_voice_1601111_58": "Hmm... You know...",
  "str_voice_1601111_59": "As always... you have my gratitude...",
  "str_voice_1601111_6": "Don't touch my crystals in battle, or they'll end up trapping you!",
  "str_voice_1601111_7": "Faith? No matter what you believe in, salvation is but a dream...",
  "str_voice_1601111_8": "You want to know about my past? Even if you knew, would that change anything? Or are you saying... you can save me?",
  "str_voice_1601111_9": "Can I find my happiness like a normal person? Perhaps I already have here...",
  "str_voice_1601121_1": "Don't you ever change your clothes? Or perhaps you just own 300 identical outfits?",
  "str_voice_1601121_10": "I'm bored... Let's start a fire. The Fireflies can clean it up later.",
  "str_voice_1601121_11": "You just want me to stand here for the others to gawk at? If anyone passes by, can I set them on fire?",
  "str_voice_1601121_12": "You look like you need a pick-me-up... How about I wash your face with fire? It won't hurt much.",
  "str_voice_1601121_13": "Training? Not for me, thanks. Trust me, the power of fire comes from within.",
  "str_voice_1601121_14": "I came across some beautiful accessories in Umbraton recently. How about we head back there and place an order?",
  "str_voice_1601121_15": "Let me light your birthday candles!",
  "str_voice_1601121_16": "Are there any battles planned for today?",
  "str_voice_1601121_17": "The sun, it burns my eyes! Why didn't anyone close the curtain!?",
  "str_voice_1601121_18": "A whole day went by and I didn't even get to do anything! I didn't even lay eyes on an Eclipsite, let alone fight one!",
  "str_voice_1601121_19": "I like the night. It's peaceful... but it's also a little boring.",
  "str_voice_1601121_2": "Stop pestering me with questions about this, that, and the other... You're like a child who doesn't understand a single thing!",
  "str_voice_1601121_20": "Umbraton is full of noise, and there's plenty of fighting to be had there, but it's also filled with a sense of freedom as if every street is paved with opportunity.",
  "str_voice_1601121_21": "Lumopolis is a place only a minority of old-fashioned nobles could ever find happiness.",
  "str_voice_1601121_22": "Live for the moment.",
  "str_voice_1601121_23": "That was pathetic! Not even enough for a warm-up!",
  "str_voice_1601121_24": "If I hadn't come to Umbraton, I wouldn't have met Tessa. She's so cool! Nothing fazes her!",
  "str_voice_1601121_25": "Conflict arises wherever you go, so you always need someone around to keep the peace. In Umbraton, that someone is Istvan.",
  "str_voice_1601121_26": "Walking the line between life and death is more exciting than anything else in the world. That's why I love fighting!",
  "str_voice_1601121_27": "I'd rather die than live a life bound by rules!",
  "str_voice_1601121_28": "I've never seen anything so huge... I wonder what it's like to fly on it...",
  "str_voice_1601121_29": "I'm Smokey. Are you the owner of this Colossus? Where can I find some fun here, and more importantly, can I set on fire?",
  "str_voice_1601121_3": "Some people say my shoes are too loud when I walk... Well, too bad! I absolutely adore them!",
  "str_voice_1601121_30": "The flames are rising.",
  "str_voice_1601121_31": "Let's find something even bigger to burn!",
  "str_voice_1601121_32": "This is my true power!",
  "str_voice_1601121_33": "Follow me, manticore!",
  "str_voice_1601121_34": "Burn them to a crisp!",
  "str_voice_1601121_35": "Watch this!",
  "str_voice_1601121_36": "Let's go burn something!",
  "str_voice_1601121_37": "Burn, baby, burn!",
  "str_voice_1601121_38": "Fire! The solution to all life's problems!",
  "str_voice_1601121_39": "Where do you think you're going!?",
  "str_voice_1601121_4": "Can I launch my fireballs at your Fireflies? They can fix themselves, anyway...",
  "str_voice_1601121_40": "Good night!",
  "str_voice_1601121_41": "Alright! I can do this!",
  "str_voice_1601121_42": "Too easy!",
  "str_voice_1601121_43": "Oh... I missed.",
  "str_voice_1601121_44": "You think I'll just set fire to everything all the time? Okay, maybe I will, but not here!",
  "str_voice_1601121_45": "I'll take it!",
  "str_voice_1601121_46": "This is not bad...",
  "str_voice_1601121_47": "You're too kind!",
  "str_voice_1601121_48": "Come on! You're after something, aren't you?",
  "str_voice_1601121_49": "If I didn't snore so much, maybe I never would've met Istvan...",
  "str_voice_1601121_5": "Imagine how amazing it would be to drop fireballs from the Colossus! Especially when we're chasing after Eclipsites!",
  "str_voice_1601121_50": "See this brooch? Legend has it that it's made from the skull of a manticore. My family handed it down to me...",
  "str_voice_1601121_51": "The burning flames within me gradually left me unable to feel pain... So, that's why I need so much stimulation!",
  "str_voice_1601121_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1601121_53": "Hello?",
  "str_voice_1601121_54": "Morning!",
  "str_voice_1601121_55": "Is it noon already?",
  "str_voice_1601121_56": "Good night!",
  "str_voice_1601121_57": "It's just another ordinary day. I mean, what's there to celebrate?",
  "str_voice_1601121_58": "Yo, Navigator! Wanna play with fire? I promise it won't burn you.",
  "str_voice_1601121_59": "Why are you always sending me so much stuff? I don't get it...",
  "str_voice_1601121_6": "See this flaming manticore? Isn't it beautiful?",
  "str_voice_1601121_7": "I used to fight the Eclipsites alongside the nobles of Lumopolis. Haha, you didn't see that coming, did you?",
  "str_voice_1601121_8": "Fires always seem to break out when I snore in the night... Please remember to warn the Fireflies!",
  "str_voice_1601121_9": "I'm part of the Manticore family. Haven't you heard of us? Never mind.",
  "str_voice_1601151_1": "You ask me what freedom is? This is a good question. But before I give you my reply, wouldn't you rather find your own answers?",
  "str_voice_1601151_10": "I see a light in your eyes that is different from any Aurorian's. May I guess what's on your mind?",
  "str_voice_1601151_11": "The environment here is more agreeable than expected, and I am pleased to accept this mission from nature. I hope my arrival will not disappoint you.",
  "str_voice_1601151_12": "Perhaps you never noticed, but the power of nature was always by your side, guiding you.",
  "str_voice_1601151_13": "The wind tells the clouds, the clouds tell the rain, the rain tells the earth, and the earth tells the wind... All things will eventually find an answer.",
  "str_voice_1601151_14": "How do you do? Any mail for Lumopolis?",
  "str_voice_1601151_15": "Happy birthday. With another year comes a deeper understanding of nature.",
  "str_voice_1601151_16": "I sometimes need to deal with urgent Courier Union matters, but nothing too difficult. How about you?",
  "str_voice_1601151_17": "Sorry, Olive and Palm always sing like this when they wake up. Did they disturb you?",
  "str_voice_1601151_18": "Shall we go for a walk? Let's take Bessie with us. We can get some rest in the forest depths.",
  "str_voice_1601151_19": "I unexpectedly met you in my dreams... Perhaps you will be the one to guide me onward...",
  "str_voice_1601151_2": "Please forgive me—introductions are in order. Bessie is my deer, and Olive and Palm are my cuckoos. They are not only my Speakers, they are also my most sincere friends.",
  "str_voice_1601151_20": "Here in the realm of nature, we are free to convey our love and hopes however we so desire.",
  "str_voice_1601151_21": "One day, I will return to Northland... Back to that warm forest. One day...",
  "str_voice_1601151_22": "You must have faith that the Courier Union will always deliver.",
  "str_voice_1601151_23": "Chaos and disorder... I am certain they are not products of nature.",
  "str_voice_1601151_24": "Her Majesty is the envoy of nature's power, guiding the way for every lost child.",
  "str_voice_1601151_25": "The snowman with wings? That's Tweety. She is a simple and kind child.",
  "str_voice_1601151_26": "Every creature in this world was born by the will of nature, and each is beautiful in its own way.",
  "str_voice_1601151_27": "The warmth my mother brought me can be found in this cape. It protects me from the cold.",
  "str_voice_1601151_28": "My fireflies and your fireflies, Caelestites and Aurorians, the Colossus and nature... We live in a wonderful world.",
  "str_voice_1601151_29": "I have been waiting to meet you for so long. Now, the power of nature has finally guided me to you. It's a pleasure to meet you. I am Naroxel.",
  "str_voice_1601151_3": "These little things glowing in my bag are fireflies, but they're not like the ones on the Colossus. They have been with me ever since we were in Windward Forest.",
  "str_voice_1601151_30": "I can hear it... The call of nature.",
  "str_voice_1601151_31": "Hear the song of the wind...",
  "str_voice_1601151_32": "Witness the dance of water...",
  "str_voice_1601151_33": "Feel the breath of freedom...",
  "str_voice_1601151_34": "Follow your heart.",
  "str_voice_1601151_35": "Let's go, Bessie.",
  "str_voice_1601151_36": "I await your guidance.",
  "str_voice_1601151_37": "Let nature take its course.",
  "str_voice_1601151_38": "Go with nature!",
  "str_voice_1601151_39": "Dance upon the wind.",
  "str_voice_1601151_4": "The moment I serenely accepted my fate, I saw time flowing and space expanding, and I knew that freedom had opened its doors to me.",
  "str_voice_1601151_40": "Firefly Forest!",
  "str_voice_1601151_41": "Come with me.",
  "str_voice_1601151_42": "This is nature's praise for us.",
  "str_voice_1601151_43": "Maybe this is also nature's plan...",
  "str_voice_1601151_44": "Have you heard the call of nature?",
  "str_voice_1601151_45": "Thank you. You needn't have troubled yourself.",
  "str_voice_1601151_46": "Thank you for your kindness. I will accept it.",
  "str_voice_1601151_47": "It has a natural smell. I like it.",
  "str_voice_1601151_48": "How do you know exactly what I like...? Is nature guiding you?",
  "str_voice_1601151_49": "When I was very young, I met Bessie, Olive, Palm, and these fireflies in Windward Forest. Since then, we have never been apart.",
  "str_voice_1601151_5": "Seeing me brings good luck...? Does such a rumor really exist? On the off chance it is true, I'd like to pass this luck on to you.",
  "str_voice_1601151_50": "Bessie helped me to realize my place and mission in this world. I must follow the guidance of nature and continue to move forward to complete my reincarnation in the natural realm.",
  "str_voice_1601151_51": "My parents loved me as if I were their own daughter. Although there are many luxurious clothes in the stores of Lumopolis, I feel the homemade clothes sent to me by my mother are the most comfortable there are.",
  "str_voice_1601151_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1601151_53": "You are here?",
  "str_voice_1601151_54": "Start a new day with nature.",
  "str_voice_1601151_55": "It is a good time for relaxation.",
  "str_voice_1601151_56": "We shall meet in our dreams.",
  "str_voice_1601151_57": "The new year brings new life, which is always worth welcoming.",
  "str_voice_1601151_58": "Where do you go when you feel tired, Navigator?",
  "str_voice_1601151_59": "Do you like music, Navigator?",
  "str_voice_1601151_6": "Yes, I can communicate with animals and plants, just as you can connect with others telepathically. These are our natural gifts.",
  "str_voice_1601151_60": "Thank you, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1601151_7": "If you wish to see me, please whisper my name in your heart. Nature will guide me to your side again.",
  "str_voice_1601151_8": "I asked Bessie to go for a walk with me and we unexpectedly ran into you. Perhaps that was Bessie's intention—she does like you very much, after all.",
  "str_voice_1601151_9": "Olive and Palm are singing a song about you. Who would have guessed you would make such a deep impression on the both of them?",
  "str_voice_1601161_1": "Huh? We're a little jammed up here... I know! Let me write this down!",
  "str_voice_1601161_10": "Why are you always looking at me? Oh... You must want to see my work! You're welcome to take a look!",
  "str_voice_1601161_11": "It's okay if I stay here a little longer, right? I finally have the chance to study the structure of a Colossus!",
  "str_voice_1601161_12": "What a huge Colossus... The technology in it is so advanced—it'll make for mighty fine reference material!",
  "str_voice_1601161_13": "I received a strange letter a few days ago... Hmm, I'm not sure what I should do about it.",
  "str_voice_1601161_14": "Do you want to see my toolbox? I call it Allen, and it's full of interesting tools!",
  "str_voice_1601161_15": "Huh? Today is your birthday!? Well then, Happy birthday!",
  "str_voice_1601161_16": "There's so much to repair today! There's the daily Colossus maintenance, that stack of Rediesel Wrench requests... The list goes on and on!",
  "str_voice_1601161_17": "Good morning! My repair work didn't wake you up, did it?",
  "str_voice_1601161_18": "It's evening already? The day's almost done, and I still have a few things to repair!",
  "str_voice_1601161_19": "These schematics are so hard to draw... It looks like I'm going to be up all night.",
  "str_voice_1601161_2": "I wonder what the principles behind the Fireflies are. They're amazing.",
  "str_voice_1601161_20": "Life with the Rediesel Wrench is so liberating! Even if you don't get along with someone, you can just fight them!",
  "str_voice_1601161_21": "The Illumina Undercities are not only stuffy when it comes to working conditions, they're also stuffy in their antiquated practices! When will they learn to adapt?",
  "str_voice_1601161_22": "Lepidoz! Cool!",
  "str_voice_1601161_23": "Those damned Eclipsites need their brains repaired!",
  "str_voice_1601161_24": "That glasses girl's technique is really impressive. It's hard to imagine that she taught herself all she knows.",
  "str_voice_1601161_25": "It's so easy to get along with that revolver girl! She always shoots from the hip, and she never blushes when she sees me.",
  "str_voice_1601161_26": "Machines never lie, and they're always to the point. Either they work, or they don't.",
  "str_voice_1601161_27": "Sigh... I wish people were more straightforward. I'm tired of all these clues and hints everyday.",
  "str_voice_1601161_28": "It's a lot better than Lepidoz... But it's pretty hard to control.",
  "str_voice_1601161_29": "You're the Navigator, right? Nice to meet you! I can fix almost anything, even a Colossus!",
  "str_voice_1601161_3": "That revolver girl knows how to take care of business. After all, she's the one who brought me to the Rediesel Wrench in the first place.",
  "str_voice_1601161_30": "Ah, there are so many parts to this thing!",
  "str_voice_1601161_31": "It's time to upgrade my toolbox!",
  "str_voice_1601161_32": "I've got it!",
  "str_voice_1601161_33": "Mecha Soul! Ignite!",
  "str_voice_1601161_34": "Is it my turn?",
  "str_voice_1601161_35": "Assembly complete!",
  "str_voice_1601161_36": "You're up, wrench!",
  "str_voice_1601161_37": "Machine Overload!",
  "str_voice_1601161_38": "Boom, baby!",
  "str_voice_1601161_39": "Up and at 'em, Allen!",
  "str_voice_1601161_4": "There are many different kinds of screwdrivers in the world... Make sure you use them properly!",
  "str_voice_1601161_40": "Hit 'em where it hurts!",
  "str_voice_1601161_41": "No problemo!",
  "str_voice_1601161_42": "You're all so amazing!",
  "str_voice_1601161_43": "Argh... My wrench broke...",
  "str_voice_1601161_44": "Need something? No problem, but I have my hands full right now so you'll have to wait.",
  "str_voice_1601161_45": "Thanks! I love it! Haha!",
  "str_voice_1601161_46": "I don't know how to thank you...",
  "str_voice_1601161_47": "You always seem to have something for me.",
  "str_voice_1601161_48": "Thank you so much! How can I ever repay you!?",
  "str_voice_1601161_49": "Lepidoz breaks down all the time... If I hadn't fixed her two years ago, she'd still be sleeping in her den right now.",
  "str_voice_1601161_5": "Life's difficulties are like stubborn screws. Sometimes you just need the right kind of screwdriver to ease them out.",
  "str_voice_1601161_50": "I wasn't popular with the guys in Illumina... It's so strange how they practically forced me out.",
  "str_voice_1601161_51": "I guess I inherited my horns and tail from distant ancestors. My great grandfather also came out like this, and he didn't have many guy friends, either!",
  "str_voice_1601161_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1601161_53": "Hey, are you there?",
  "str_voice_1601161_54": "Wakey wakey! What do you need fixing today?",
  "str_voice_1601161_55": "Hey! What's for lunch?",
  "str_voice_1601161_56": "Ah, my head's buzzing! Let's have a rest!",
  "str_voice_1601161_57": "My New Year's resolution? It's to increase my mechanical manufacturing progress by 10 points!",
  "str_voice_1601161_6": "I've really learned a lot here. Thanks to your support, I can now upgrade my mecha gear! But I'll need a whole lot more metal, first...",
  "str_voice_1601161_7": "I remember Illumina set up a special boys-only class for me. I guess they were afraid the girls were getting too distracted! Heh...",
  "str_voice_1601161_8": "Illumina arranged for me to work in a men-only factory for a while... That was a dull period of my life!",
  "str_voice_1601161_9": "My horns and tail always get a lot of attention... I'm not sure why, though.",
  "str_voice_1601161_99": "Can I take a few Wandering Colossus parts with me as mementos after the performance?",
  "str_voice_1601171_1": "Don't let today's failures get you down, you'll make it through in the end. Life's never easy when you're young, but you'll see it's nothing when you look back a decade later.",
  "str_voice_1601171_10": "It's not healthy just lounging around at the base all the time. But what can one do? Sharpen your knife, clean your gun, do some squats, even.",
  "str_voice_1601171_11": "You transferred me here? Well, the same thing happened when I retired. Fortunately, I'm used to it.",
  "str_voice_1601171_12": "I may be retired, but I still train occasionally. No rest for the wicked, eh?",
  "str_voice_1601171_13": "Good rest requires good food, and we get the best food here in logistics.",
  "str_voice_1601171_14": "Tired? Take a break. That's your body saying it's time to rest.",
  "str_voice_1601171_15": "Happy birthday! Here's your cake. Don't worry, I used to be a cook.",
  "str_voice_1601171_16": "Although you command a Colossus, you look like a logistics man...",
  "str_voice_1601171_17": "Morning sets the tone for the day. Start your day right with a good morning routine.",
  "str_voice_1601171_18": "Eat and relax when it gets late, and you'll have a better tomorrow.",
  "str_voice_1601171_19": "Can't sleep? Work out and take a bath. Staying up all night is never the answer!",
  "str_voice_1601171_2": "Muscles aching, eh? Have you been overdoing your training? I'll get you something good to eat this evening—that should sort you out.",
  "str_voice_1601171_20": "Illumina thrives because every member adheres to their duty.",
  "str_voice_1601171_21": "Humph, Lumopolis. Their soldiers are like sheep, not dissimilar to Eclipsites...",
  "str_voice_1601171_22": "Splendor Illumina!",

  "str_voice_1601171_24": "Trust in the Grand Marshal. She has always led us to victory.",
  "str_voice_1601171_25": "Revy... Sometimes I can't tell whether it's a him or a her.",
  "str_voice_1601171_26": "Logistics is vital! Nothing boosts morale like a hot meal!",
  "str_voice_1601171_27": "Indulgence can defeat the strongest soldier. Go work out!",
  "str_voice_1601171_28": "This thing's huge! I'm glad I'm not the one managing it!",
  "str_voice_1601171_29": "Relax! I'm retired now, so just call me Gram! Feel free to ask me anything about combat and logistics.",
  "str_voice_1601171_3": "Ah... The folly of youth, rambunctious and self-righteous, thinking you're the savior of the day... But there's no harm in that.",
  "str_voice_1601171_30": "I feel young again.",
  "str_voice_1601171_31": "Now I'll show you some real skills!",
  "str_voice_1601171_32": "I'll fight to the bitter end.",
  "str_voice_1601171_33": "The Goddess of Victory smiles upon me!",

  "str_voice_1601171_35": "Preparations are now in order!",
  "str_voice_1601171_36": "Wait for that final moment!",
  "str_voice_1601171_37": "Your time has come... Now!",
  "str_voice_1601171_38": "Fire! Burn them to ashes!",
  "str_voice_1601171_39": "This is just the beginning...",
  "str_voice_1601171_4": "You think I'm improving? Indeed, I've been practicing secretly. It seems to have paid off.",
  "str_voice_1601171_40": "And this is the end!",
  "str_voice_1601171_41": "On me, everyone.",
  "str_voice_1601171_42": "Eclipsites are so weak these days.",
  "str_voice_1601171_43": "I'll watch your back! Now go!",
  "str_voice_1601171_44": "I've been fighting longer than you've been alive. No, no, don't you worry about me!",
  "str_voice_1601171_45": "Hmm? Why did you give me this?",
  "str_voice_1601171_46": "Thank you. You have a keen eye.",
  "str_voice_1601171_47": "This is... Hmm. I'll take it.",
  "str_voice_1601171_48": "Thank you! I promise to have your back!",
  "str_voice_1601171_49": "Sometimes it's not bad being an ordinary logistics officer. Anyway, this is how I started in the army, and it's certainly much less disciplined.",
  "str_voice_1601171_5": "Don't be so skeptical of an old man's words—I've seen more than you can imagine. The last time someone looked at me with those eyes... It was just before he fought his final battle.",
  "str_voice_1601171_50": "The Stone Force... was defeated in a fierce battle more than a decade ago. When I think of my fallen comrades, I sometimes wish I had died instead of them.",
  "str_voice_1601171_51": "Seeing my comrades died one by one, I once thought death was the answer for me, too. Fortunately, Brent's words gave me hope. Now, I live for those fallen heroes.",

  "str_voice_1601171_55": "The afternoon's the best time to eat your fill.",
  "str_voice_1601171_56": "A good night's sleep is the best way to guarantee a great start to the next day.",
  "str_voice_1601171_57": "Happy new year! I hope we get to fight together next year, too.",
  "str_voice_1601171_58": "Seeing as I'll be aboard your Colossus from now on, I think an introduction is in order.",

  "str_voice_1601171_6": "No one harms my comrades! I won't let them forget it... I'll drill it into their thick skulls!",

  "str_voice_1601171_62": "Let me ask you a question.",
  "str_voice_1601171_7": "Make detailed plans for tactics, fight bravely in battles. As a commander, you should understand this well. That's all I have to say.",
  "str_voice_1601171_8": "If you get too nervous in battle, just chat with your comrades and crack a few jokes. It'll help you to relax and allow you to fight to your full potential.",
  "str_voice_1601171_9": "You commanded your troop well in your recent battles. It reminded me of my previous days in the Stone Force. There were people like you, even back then.",
  "str_voice_1601191_1": "I like machinery—I can study it all day long, but I'm not so good yet. Know any good mechanics? I need some help...",
  "str_voice_1601191_10": "I thought about making a mark on Alter-Blade for each Eclipsite maggot I slice up. But there are too many... I can't count that high, and can't write so much...",
  "str_voice_1601191_11": "What can I do here? Well... Think, for example, how to slice Eclipsites better.",
  "str_voice_1601191_12": "When will it rain? Can you tell me? Rainy days are good, because I can shower for free!",
  "str_voice_1601191_13": "Have you ever sliced up an Eclipsite? Oh, of course not... A commander commands. Next time, I will tell you what it feels like.",
  "str_voice_1601191_14": "That old man is really good at fighting. I heard he's killed many Eclipsites. If he hadn't, I really wouldn't have any reason to talk to him! Hmph!",
  "str_voice_1601191_15": "Your birthday...? I'll give you some spicy riceballs, then...",
  "str_voice_1601191_16": "Seeing you, Navigator, it makes me more excited to go out on patrol.",
  "str_voice_1601191_17": "Good morning! I have developed a new move today!",
  "str_voice_1601191_18": "Don't run around at night. If the boss sees you, you'll get caught and scolded... and that's no good, is it. Oh? You're the biggest boss around here? Then there's nothing to worry about.",
  "str_voice_1601191_19": "What? You do not need sleep? You want to go patrolling with me? I'm touched... Though, it is rather unnecessary...",
  "str_voice_1601191_2": "You're good, and can navigate the Colossus—so that makes you a good Navigator! You can call me Revy, or Revie? Revi? Call me whatever you want!",
  "str_voice_1601191_20": "A good thing about Illumina is, if someone dies, many people are willing to take care of the orphaned children. This is how I was raised.",
  "str_voice_1601191_21": "I hear that people in Umbraton ask for money to do anything at all. So, do they also ask for money to do nothing?",
  "str_voice_1601191_22": "Splendor Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1601191_23": "Bah! Not enough maggots to slice!",
  "str_voice_1601191_24": "Vida is similar to me. If she has soup to eat, then she is happy. If I have Eclipsites to slice, then I am happy.",
  "str_voice_1601191_25": "That old man is very nosy, and he's always saying this and that like a veteran, when he's actually already retired!",
  "str_voice_1601191_26": "Rainy days and spicy riceballs... These ones are too spicy! Do you have any napkins? Hot, hot, hot!",
  "str_voice_1601191_27": "See my face and arm? It was those Eclipsite maggots! So, when I see them, I slice them all in one! Oh... Slice them in two, I mean...",
  "str_voice_1601191_28": "This thing is so big! I don't know if Illumina has one of these—I just know that I haven't seen one before.",
  "str_voice_1601191_29": "I'm Revy. Everyone says I'm strong, and they're not wrong. Look at this huge sword! Everyone says it's heavy, but I swing it like a butter knife. See...?",
  "str_voice_1601191_3": "The gears go \"click, click\"...? Oh, my Alter-Blade! I was wondering what you were prattling on about...",
  "str_voice_1601191_30": "More, please.",
  "str_voice_1601191_31": "Ready to rumble, like the thunder itself!",
  "str_voice_1601191_32": "The storm is growing more violent!",
  "str_voice_1601191_33": "Spin! Fear me!",
  "str_voice_1601191_34": "Make me Captain!",
  "str_voice_1601191_35": "I'm ready!",
  "str_voice_1601191_36": "It's time now!",
  "str_voice_1601191_37": "Charge! Perish!",
  "str_voice_1601191_38": "Never! Enough!",
  "str_voice_1601191_39": "Go with the flow!",
  "str_voice_1601191_4": "Eclipsites... One slash makes two halves, two slashes makes four halves, and three slashes makes eight halves...",
  "str_voice_1601191_40": "I will end them all!",
  "str_voice_1601191_41": "I deserve this!",
  "str_voice_1601191_42": "Praise me, praise me!",
  "str_voice_1601191_43": "I'll get them next time!",
  "str_voice_1601191_44": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Who else? Well, forget them. I won't count the ones I defeated...",
  "str_voice_1601191_45": "Thank you, and you're welcome!",
  "str_voice_1601191_46": "I can... take it? I'm blushing...",
  "str_voice_1601191_47": "Navigator! You are too good!",
  "str_voice_1601191_48": "I'm shy! Don't look at me!",
  "str_voice_1601191_49": "I fought the Eclipsites at school and got this scar on my face. But the other kids ignored me. They said I was too strange...",
  "str_voice_1601191_5": "My sword? It's like plucking a pigeon feather for me! How oh-so-very light it is! Not that I've ever plucked anything's feathers before...",
  "str_voice_1601191_50": "When I was young, Eclipsite maggots raided my home. My parents went to save some other people. The neighbors saved me. That was when I lost my left hand.",
  "str_voice_1601191_51": "Looking at my arm? It was given to me by Illumina... because my parents died fighting Eclipsites... and saved loads of people!",
  "str_voice_1601191_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1601191_53": "You're back!",
  "str_voice_1601191_54": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1601191_55": "Have you eaten lunch?",
  "str_voice_1601191_56": "I wish you sweet dreams!",
  "str_voice_1601191_57": "Happy New Year! I wish you more power in the New Year!",
  "str_voice_1601191_58": "Here I am!",
  "str_voice_1601191_59": "My sword is making that clicking noise again...",
  "str_voice_1601191_6": "Ah! The sweet scent of power! What? Did I say it wrong? If you understood, that's good enough...",
  "str_voice_1601191_60": "I've gotten even stronger!",
  "str_voice_1601191_61": "What are you doing?",
  "str_voice_1601191_62": "Off to inspect the Colossus again?",
  "str_voice_1601191_7": "If I say you look much older than me, I do not mean you're old. Stable? Reliable? Experienced and trusty?",
  "str_voice_1601191_8": "With the Navigator, even if I'm misunderstood, Alter-Blade's chains stay still. It's so strange...",
  "str_voice_1601191_9": "Though I'm younger than you, I'm very powerful, especially with this mechanical arm! When the fight begins, just hide behind me.",
  "str_voice_1601201_1": "I know, you must be curious about the giant knight who is always at my side. You can call it Pompey or the Knight of Light.",
  "str_voice_1601201_10": "I know, spending countless hours alone indoors can be quite tedious. When I get bored, I ask Pompey to take me to rooftops to stare at the sky and clouds.",
  "str_voice_1601201_11": "What a peaceful place. May I just stay here? Good. Don't bring anyone else here.",
  "str_voice_1601201_12": "White Night up high. I know that the faith of Lumopolis can save the Aurorians... and the Caelestites.",
  "str_voice_1601201_13": "Collecting lost books is like a jigsaw puzzle. For me, it is a game.",
  "str_voice_1601201_14": "It's time to grease Pompey. Hmm... a quick polish too.",
  "str_voice_1601201_15": "Well... I won't go to your birthday party, but I'll wish you a happy birthday in advance.",
  "str_voice_1601201_16": "I found a wonderful article! It's about... Oh, maybe you wouldn't be interested in it.",
  "str_voice_1601201_17": "The clouds in the sky are at their most beautiful at this time of the day. Don't you want to see?",
  "str_voice_1601201_18": "What? You only have three courses for dinner? It's hard to imagine such a thing...",
  "str_voice_1601201_19": "I have also forgotten to sleep in the past because I have been enraptured by reading. And what about you for today?",
  "str_voice_1601201_2": "Sorry, I'm not used to talking with others. It would be better if we became more familiar with each other in the future, you say? Then please, I will accept your best efforts.",
  "str_voice_1601201_20": "The center of the world, the apex of Aurorian civilization... The most suitable place for me to live my life.",
  "str_voice_1601201_21": "In the far north, under the Aurora-swept sky... Does the original child of light still live there?",
  "str_voice_1601201_22": "White Night up high.",
  "str_voice_1601201_23": "Those ugly, filthy things? Of course I know what they are. Those creatures don't deserve to exist in this world.",
  "str_voice_1601201_24": "Lord Schwartz, the City Lord who leads Lumopolis forward on the path of righteousness, is the person I respect most in this world.",
  "str_voice_1601201_25": "Of course I know Her Highness, Carleen. After all, she is one of the few people of my age equal to me.",
  "str_voice_1601201_26": "I like reading. I read books, objects... even Aurorians.",
  "str_voice_1601201_27": "Group activities? I've never tried... But maybe I'm just innately adverse to people.",
  "str_voice_1601201_28": "I knew such a thing existed in the world, but I didn't expect it to be bigger than Pompey.",
  "str_voice_1601201_29": "I shall carry forth the legend of the Knight of Light... Oh, you must be the Caelestite. White Night up high. Hedy Bryte offers you her sincerest salutations.",
  "str_voice_1601201_3": "Solitude is a realm itself, one that places higher requirements upon the individual. Only by being alone can I truly know my innermost desires.",
  "str_voice_1601201_30": "I didn't know I could possess such power... How did you do it?",
  "str_voice_1601201_31": "I can go, a little further now.",
  "str_voice_1601201_32": "I see... the path of the Knight of Light.",
  "str_voice_1601201_33": "The future, will change with me.",
  "str_voice_1601201_34": "Hmm? As you wish.",
  "str_voice_1601201_35": "Let us begin.",
  "str_voice_1601201_36": "At long last, it is my turn.",
  "str_voice_1601201_37": "Knight of Light, come to me!",
  "str_voice_1601201_38": "Darkness has nowhere to hide!",
  "str_voice_1601201_39": "To my side, Pompey!",
  "str_voice_1601201_4": "The world outside Lumopolis... I've read a lot about it in various books, but maybe one day, I can see it with my own eyes.",
  "str_voice_1601201_40": "Feel the light of glory!",
  "str_voice_1601201_41": "I'll put a swift end to this.",
  "str_voice_1601201_42": "For the Knight of Light, this was nothing.",
  "str_voice_1601201_43": "A humiliating battle... I won't accept it!",
  "str_voice_1601201_44": "Hmm... This matter needs to be considered carefully.",
  "str_voice_1601201_45": "What is this...? Of course I know it's a gift!",
  "str_voice_1601201_46": "Hmm... Thank you for your trouble.",
  "str_voice_1601201_47": "Did you really have to give this to me face to face? No, it's nothing...",
  "str_voice_1601201_48": "You know... I quite like this gift!",
  "str_voice_1601201_49": "Happiness sometimes blinds people. I used to think that everyone had a private tutor... And I used to think that everyone was used to being alone.",
  "str_voice_1601201_5": "As long as you work at it, there is no book that cannot be read. Do you understand? The most difficult thing to comprehend is oneself.",
  "str_voice_1601201_50": "The monsters in my dreams, with their sharp fangs and claws... They were so real and terrifying that they seemed to swallow my soul completely... Only books had the power to save me.",
  "str_voice_1601201_51": "I had that nightmare again, only this time, a knight clad in white armor emerged from the light and dispelled the darkness before me.",
  "str_voice_1601201_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1601201_53": "I know...",
  "str_voice_1601201_54": "I bid you good morning.",
  "str_voice_1601201_55": "I bid you good day.",
  "str_voice_1601201_56": "I bid you good night.",
  "str_voice_1601201_57": "In the New Year, I wish you peace.",
  "str_voice_1601201_6": "So, you used to be all alone... How did you make so many friends after that? Don't get me wrong, I'm just curious.",
  "str_voice_1601201_7": "Overlooking those vast crowds of people, you will understand that people do not feel for each other's sorrow and joy.",
  "str_voice_1601201_8": "You should read more historical studies on Lumopolis. Because then... then we will have more in common to talk about.",
  "str_voice_1601201_9": "I read that those who help each other can be referred to as friends. So, are you going to help me? Well... I'll help you if you need me to.",
  "str_voice_1601211_1": "Thorns do not hurt people—they just stand there in peace. People's words, however, can stab in your back like the sharpest knife. So, which is more terrible...?",
  "str_voice_1601211_10": "I prefer being idle to being busy. Letting my mind wander... Looking at my coin, feeling the thorns...",
  "str_voice_1601211_11": "The scenery here is quite pleasant. It fills my mind with countless thoughts... about how to deal with those Lumopolis brutes...",
  "str_voice_1601211_12": "In the eyes of the God of Light, all people are equal. Oh, it's just that some people are more equal than others.",
  "str_voice_1601211_13": "Even the sharpest thorns are accompanied by beautiful flowers. Take a look for yourself...",
  "str_voice_1601211_14": "Our determination pushes us forward... But if we go the wrong way from the very beginning, won't we stray further from our true course?",
  "str_voice_1601211_15": "Happy birthday. It is an old-fashioned expression, but I can't think of anything better to say.",
  "str_voice_1601211_16": "Another ordinary day begins. Oh, if it were not ordinary, we wouldn't be here, would we?",
  "str_voice_1601211_17": "Navigator, why do people always say good morning? What if it is a bad morning?",
  "str_voice_1601211_18": "After I finish my work, my evenings are for resting. People who work overtime are so pathetic.",
  "str_voice_1601211_19": "The still of night... perhaps it makes it easier for one to contemplate. Oh, it can also make it easier for one to fall asleep.",
  "str_voice_1601211_2": "I think, therefore I am. So, if I do not think, I shall no longer exist. I'm not thinking right now, Navigator. Can you still see me?",
  "str_voice_1601211_20": "There is no real truth in this world. Its specter exists only on the tongues of the treacherous.",
  "str_voice_1601211_21": "The priests of Lumopolis say that faith drives people onward, but it doesn't fill their stomachs.",
  "str_voice_1601211_22": "May the truth bless you, if it even exists.",
  "str_voice_1601211_23": "If the God of Light created all things, did he also create the Eclipsites?",
  "str_voice_1601211_24": "The only thing Pact and I have in common is our thorns and nothing else.",
  "str_voice_1601211_25": "Never surrender—this is Wayne's mantra. It is the principle by which he lives, and the source of his \"happiness.\"",
  "str_voice_1601211_26": "They say that bramble flowers symbolize fate's torment, but I believe they represent the soul's resilience.",
  "str_voice_1601211_27": "False beliefs tend to attract the fanatical. The more outlandish they are, the more fervent the zealotry they evoke.",

  "str_voice_1601211_3": "Justice may be delayed, but never denied. Oh... But sometimes it is so late that I think it may be absent...",
  "str_voice_1601211_30": "My power to resist grows stronger.",

  "str_voice_1601211_60": "You saw that girl with the short hair, didn't you?",
  "str_voice_1601211_61": "Excuse me, but can you tell me what the word \"faith\" means to you?",

  "str_voice_1601211_8": "The priests of Lumopolis say that those without faith are no better than beasts. I, however, believe that every beast has its day...",
  "str_voice_1601211_9": "Have you ever been to Lumopolis? Have you witnessed the nobility and staunchness of the people there? Oh, it really is quite amusing...",
  "str_voice_1601214_10": "Honesty is a virtue, but sometimes it can be misinterpreted as cruelty. I would rather be frank and offend people than be some hypocritical people-pleaser.",
  "str_voice_1601214_11": "Some people are sanctimonious spouters of supposed morality, but commit deeds worse than wanton demons, wouldn't you agree? I just love it when such cretins are exposed for what they are.",
  "str_voice_1601214_16": "The sharpest thorns guard such exceptionally beautiful flowers. This is the true essence of life, where pain and beauty coexist.",
  "str_voice_1601214_17": "Those believers are absorbed in their false faith in the God of Light, like desperate refugees of reality, searching for a non-existent light in the dark...",
  "str_voice_1601214_18": "You wish to trap me here like your little pet? I'm not a bird you can easily keep locked up for long, but the scenery here is so nice... Perhaps I'll just take a look.",
  "str_voice_1601214_19": "I've found that you really enjoy helping your friends, which is an admirable quality indeed, but sometimes you also need to ask yourself if they're really worth helping.",
  "str_voice_1601214_35": "If you can't tolerate hypocrisy and always find yourself worrying about not truly belonging, well, that's just because your heart is too pure, my dear.",
  "str_voice_1601214_36": "People whose words are incongruent with their actions are the most terrifying of all, as they are both dishonest and untrustworthy.",
  "str_voice_1601214_37": "Do you have plans for today? Or do you simply plan to let time slip away as usual?",
  "str_voice_1601214_38": "Today will be a difficult day, as the briars are in full bloom. This, my dear, signifies that fate's torment is nigh.",
  "str_voice_1601214_39": "Have you had dinner yet? Not even fanatical fasting will make your faith bear fruit.",

  "str_voice_1601221_11": "Did you post this mission? Even if it's you, you'll still need to pay me, but I'll only make you pay 97.6% of the price. How's that for a discount?",
  "str_voice_1601221_12": "Think of me, when you need a job done.",
  "str_voice_1601221_13": "Sorry for staring... I'm a sniper—I can't help it!",

  "str_voice_1601221_48": "Thank you. I think this may be the best piece I've ever received.",
  "str_voice_1601221_49": "Why so obsessed with antiques? My parents were collectors before they died, so it is both a gift and my birthright. There's no need to comfort me—I'm no longer sad for them.",
  "str_voice_1601221_5": "The most precious treasures are often those hidden in the heart.",
  "str_voice_1601221_50": "Of course, I was full of resentment for everything when I was little, but the truth is... people will eventually learn what love is as life goes on. What? Surprised to hear me say such a thing?",
  "str_voice_1601221_51": "Carrying on their love, reviving their desires to live, and repaying those who have helped me are the things that matter most to me. Well, that and making money.",

  "str_voice_1601221_6": "Hairline cracks, damaged enamel, an incomplete base... None of those can hide the real value of the rarest treasures. No matter what, they will always be priceless wonders.",
  "str_voice_1601221_60": "Are you there, Navigator?",
  "str_voice_1601221_7": "I know everything. I've seen everything you've done and everything you're capable of. That's why I choose to stand here, among noble and rare people like you.",
  "str_voice_1601221_8": "I'd like to share some of today's bounty with you... Not enough? Sorry, that's all I got today.",
  "str_voice_1601221_9": "I'm thinking about opening an antique shop. I'll consider giving you a discount if you come.",
  "str_voice_1601231_1": "Wh-What? Need help? Just leave it all to me!",
  "str_voice_1601231_10": "Hey, you called me, but you don't need anything! I guess waiting is also part of the job... Sheriff Cordy—now officially on standby!",
  "str_voice_1601231_11": "I'm on my way! Illumina Sheriff Cordy, reporting for duty!",
  "str_voice_1601231_12": "Hey... Please do not disturb me. My daily patrol is one task I don't want to screw up!",
  "str_voice_1601231_13": "It's okay. I can handle any task, big or small... I figure this means that you trust me!",
  "str_voice_1601231_14": "Uh-huh, I'm listening! Don't rush—just take your time.",
  "str_voice_1601231_15": "Happy birthday! What's your birthday wish? Let me help make it come true!",
  "str_voice_1601231_16": "What do you need me to do next, Navigator? A sheriff's work is never done!",
  "str_voice_1601231_17": "Good morning, Navigator! Did you sleep well last night? Have you had your breakfast yet? Hey!? Didn't you get enough sleep...?",
  "str_voice_1601231_18": "Good evening! Today was a busy day!",
  "str_voice_1601231_19": "It's bedtime now. Why aren't you... Wait... You have an emergency request, don't you!?",
  "str_voice_1601231_2": "Three slices of toast and a cup of black tea for breakfast, an Illumina set meal for lunch, plus two puddings and a can of... Oh... Actually, I think I'll only have an apple for dinner tonight...",
  "str_voice_1601231_20": "The organizational structure of Illumina is extremely complex, so it's not always easy to maintain order here.",
  "str_voice_1601231_21": "I don't have anything against Umbraton, but... Well, maybe I have a few problems with that place...",
  "str_voice_1601231_22": "Splendor... Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1601231_23": "Bullying the weak and disturbing public order... prepare to be punished!",
  "str_voice_1601231_24": "If my officers hadn't believed in me, I'd never have had the chance to do my dream job.",
  "str_voice_1601231_25": "I didn't really want to say anything, but there are some things I like about her.",
  "str_voice_1601231_26": "I like to help others and calculate the calories of... Oh, no, I mean...! You didn't hear that!",
  "str_voice_1601231_27": "Don't you just hate it when a good plan falls apart?",
  "str_voice_1601231_28": "Wow, it seems the control panel has not cleaned for the whole day...? And your nutrient solution bottles are a real mess... Just leave this all to me, Navigator!",
  "str_voice_1601231_29": "Sheriff Cordy of Illumina, ready to serve you with a smile! What can I do for you, Navigator?",
  "str_voice_1601231_3": "Oh, this? It's the Illumina Sheriff uniform! Only those who pass the internship examination get to wear it! But anyway... you've been staring at me way too long!",
  "str_voice_1601231_30": "A p-promotion? Does that mean you've recognized all my hark work?",
  "str_voice_1601231_31": "A-Are you really counting on me?",
  "str_voice_1601231_32": "Thank you for trusting me! I'll do my best!",
  "str_voice_1601231_33": "I can actually feel my ability growing!",
  "str_voice_1601231_34": "Now, it's time to move out!",
  "str_voice_1601231_35": "A-Awaiting orders!",
  "str_voice_1601231_36": "Waaah... Here goes!",
  "str_voice_1601231_37": "Obey your sheriff!",
  "str_voice_1601231_38": "This baton isn't just for show!",
  "str_voice_1601231_39": "Thunder and flames!",
  "str_voice_1601231_4": "Sheriff Code of Conduct—Rule Number One! Maintain public safety and prevent all disturbances to public order! This baton isn't just for show, you know!",

  "str_voice_1601231_45": "If you really want to say thank you, send a letter to the sheriff's department!",
  "str_voice_1601231_46": "Huh? You got this just for me...? I can see you put a lot of thought into this gift!",
  "str_voice_1601231_47": "Your heart is more precious than any gift.",
  "str_voice_1601231_48": "Thank you! I really like it!",

  "str_voice_1601261_1": "As long as a transaction is voluntary and fair, it should be respected and protected. So... would you like to negotiate my acquisition of the Colossus?",
  "str_voice_1601261_10": "Transportation route, contact point, and negotiation time set... Phew, I'm finally free to have a rest. Let's take a look at my favorite book. Do you want to read it together?",
  "str_voice_1601261_11": "What kind of business consultation would you like me to provide you with? Well, before that, we'd better sign a contract that we're both happy with.",
  "str_voice_1601261_12": "Oh, look who's here. I hope that through today's talks, we can reach a consensus.",
  "str_voice_1601261_13": "Yes, I'm still busy. I apologize—my assistant is not in. Please be sure to make an appointment first. Yes, even you, Caelestite.",
  "str_voice_1601261_14": "Negotiations are now over. Who can take this esteemed guest home for me?",
  "str_voice_1601261_15": "Happy birthday! I'll take some time off to celebrate your birthday with you—the birthday of a Caelestite should prove to be a great gimmick.",
  "str_voice_1601261_16": "Good day, but also a busy day. Do you have any business meetings to attend?",
  "str_voice_1601261_17": "Good morning. A cup of coffee and the newspaper—this is my morning routine.",
  "str_voice_1601261_18": "After a hard day's work, it's always nice to read a book before going to bed. Remember to rest early.",
  "str_voice_1601261_19": "Hmm...? You... you're still awake. What am I looking at? That's a trade secret!",
  "str_voice_1601261_2": "Demand orientation is a rule that businesspersons must always keep in mind. What demand does your industry fulfill? Please tell me.",
  "str_voice_1601261_20": "This is the ideal capitalist society globally, where anyone who abides by the rules can create their fortune.",
  "str_voice_1601261_21": "Can people in Illumina really get what they desire through the rationing system alone?",
  "str_voice_1601261_22": "The shadow is watching you.",

  "str_voice_1601261_24": "Lady Sheol is also quite brusque when it comes to matters of business... She can't help it.",
  "str_voice_1601261_25": "Somehow, Connolly's coffee always fills me with a sense of nostalgic familiarity.",
  "str_voice_1601261_26": "Regulated freedom and the sound of flowing money... Um... Who told you that I collect romance novels?",
  "str_voice_1601261_27": "Dirty secrets will always eventually float up to the surface. Otherwise, I'll just dive in and drag them up myself.",
  "str_voice_1601261_28": "If you were to use this for transportation purposes, you'd make substantial profits. Are you not going to set up your own transportation company?",
  "str_voice_1601261_29": "Sorry for making you wait so long. I'm Bethel, head of Umbraton Guild Headquarters. If you'd like to talk to me about anything, please contact my assistant to make an appointment.",
  "str_voice_1601261_3": "All existence depends on rules. Whether it's law or credibility, on the surface or underground, they are the contracts you sign with the place you call home.",

  "str_voice_1601261_36": "Please sign it immediately!",
  "str_voice_1601261_37": "Let's go, Tindall!",
  "str_voice_1601261_38": "Frankel! The hunt is on!",
  "str_voice_1601261_39": "I'll make you cry.",
  "str_voice_1601261_4": "As a last resort, the contents of a contract can be adjusted. But you must be truthful, faithful, with integrity, and unconcealed. Otherwise, no one will be able to help you.",
  "str_voice_1601261_40": "Taste your own tears!",
  "str_voice_1601261_41": "Manage the team? I can do that.",

  "str_voice_1601261_43": "Market fluctuations can be... unpredictable...",
  "str_voice_1601261_44": "Hmm... It seems you've signed some kind of contract with it.",
  "str_voice_1601261_45": "I... don't have to pay for it?",
  "str_voice_1601261_46": "Thank you. I'll put it in the office.",
  "str_voice_1601261_47": "Thank you. I'll pay you back in due course.",
  "str_voice_1601261_48": "This... suits me so much. Do you happen to be a writer?",
  "str_voice_1601261_49": "My mother was born in Lumopolis, and my father was a businessman. That thing destroyed my father both mentally and physically... That's why I hate this industry so much.",
  "str_voice_1601261_5": "I know what you're looking at. It's just that refraining from looking at the tails of others is a basic rule for a person with manners.",
  "str_voice_1601261_50": "Some people in Umbraton would refer to me as the black-cloaked supplier. I was not very sensible back then and almost destroyed the Cloudrover Guild's system of operations.",
  "str_voice_1601261_51": "I ended up seriously injured when attempting to act alone... As fortune would have it, I became Istvan's adopted daughter. Luckily, I now understand the necessity of rules.",

  "str_voice_1601261_54": "There's no point getting out of bed unless there's profit to be made.",

  "str_voice_1601261_56": "The shops are all closed.",
  "str_voice_1601261_57": "In the new year, I hope that our cooperation continues as it has thus far.",
  "str_voice_1601261_6": "This is Frankel. Oh, that's Frankel, too. They're my lovely specters. Of course I can tell who is who. Huh? They don't look like pets?",
  "str_voice_1601261_7": "The black-cloaked supplier... That was my nickname back then. The nickname I held before being adopted by the Shadowlord.",
  "str_voice_1601261_8": "I really detest certain industries... Those goods that circulate beneath the shadows... As long as they exist, I will find a way to eradicate them.",
  "str_voice_1601261_9": "Acquisition, negotiation, financing, sales, marketing... I can help you with all of these. Or maybe you just want romance novels, like me?",
  "str_voice_1601291_1": "What is our new commission? When will it be delivered? Please rest assured that I will complete it promptly.",
  "str_voice_1601291_10": "This place is so neat and tidy... Can I let my little friends out for a while? Uh... As long as you're not afraid of them, that is.",
  "str_voice_1601291_11": "Please wait until I hand over the last bit... Alright, now I can execute your commission wholeheartedly.",
  "str_voice_1601291_12": "I respect the rules of Umbraton. Although some transactions... Forget it. It is precisely why that my mercenary squad exists.",
  "str_voice_1601291_13": "I saw some little things flying around here... Do you like bugs, too?",
  "str_voice_1601291_14": "I am very grateful to the commander of the White Flame Mercenaries for his care and support. Without him, I would not be who I am today.",
  "str_voice_1601291_15": "Today marks the day of your birth. The White Flame Mercenaries and I send you our sincerest wishes.",
  "str_voice_1601291_16": "You must work very hard here... Please make sure you balance work and rest. As for how to relax... would you like to see my butterflies?",
  "str_voice_1601291_17": "Good morning. It's good to see you up so early—this means that your sleep schedule is quite different from that of most mercenaries. You're healthy.",
  "str_voice_1601291_18": "The night rises... This is a good time to complete a commission.",
  "str_voice_1601291_19": "It's late. You must know that some creatures were not born to be up at such an hour.",
  "str_voice_1601291_2": "Umbraton has no laws to enforce or rules of survival to memorize. There is only credibility. This is the reason I will always be here.",
  "str_voice_1601291_20": "Umbraton is a city of freedom, but should freedom have boundaries? No one can say.",
  "str_voice_1601291_21": "Soldiers are very different from mercenaries. Executing orders is mandatory, whereas the observance of credibility is a choice.",
  "str_voice_1601291_22": "Shadows... They're everywhere, watching you.",
  "str_voice_1601291_23": "Sorry, but Eclipsites do not count as life to me. I feel nothing when I see their corpses.",
  "str_voice_1601291_24": "Allura likes things that convey a sense of time. I discovered this a long time ago.",
  "str_voice_1601291_25": "Istvan... Whether it's maintaining the balance between gangs or communication between people, there are many things I can learn from him.",
  "str_voice_1601291_26": "Insects, like Aurorians, are products of nature. All creatures should have the right to break free from their cocoons and become butterflies.",
  "str_voice_1601291_27": "Those who do not respect life, do not deserve to live.",
  "str_voice_1601291_28": "I hear it's a mixture of machinery and biology...? What a magnificent structure...",
  "str_voice_1601291_29": "Hello, I'm Luke. Can I help you with something? Please rest assured that any commissions you entrust to me will be handled professionally.",
  "str_voice_1601291_3": "So that more people know of us and believe in our might, we need to become a more influential organization... Huh? Sorry, I didn't see you there.",
  "str_voice_1601291_30": "The White Flame Mercenaries are growing stronger.",
  "str_voice_1601291_31": "They are silently clinging on to me.",
  "str_voice_1601291_32": "Unite and prosper!",
  "str_voice_1601291_33": "New life... shall constantly be born!",
  "str_voice_1601291_34": "Your commission is very welcome.",
  "str_voice_1601291_35": "Life is eternal!",
  "str_voice_1601291_36": "They are all under my control!",
  "str_voice_1601291_37": "Suffocate beneath this power!",
  "str_voice_1601291_38": "Shackles! Unlock!",
  "str_voice_1601291_39": "Fog of death!",
  "str_voice_1601291_4": "More commission means we'll need more members... but that also means more casualties. At this stage, however, we must learn to choose. So, let's choose to take on more commissions.",
  "str_voice_1601291_40": "Exterminate!",
  "str_voice_1601291_41": "I will strengthen this team!",
  "str_voice_1601291_42": "This is the might of a mercenary squad!",
  "str_voice_1601291_43": "I must work harder...",
  "str_voice_1601291_44": "This could be used as a mercenary contact point.",
  "str_voice_1601291_45": "Thank you. I'll put it on my desk.",
  "str_voice_1601291_46": "Whatever commission I pursue, I will take this with me.",
  "str_voice_1601291_47": "I've always wanted one of these... I don't know how to thank you.",
  "str_voice_1601291_48": "I will treasure it. Please give me a chance to return your kindness.",
  "str_voice_1601291_49": "Waiting is never easy, especially when you know that the person you're waiting for will never come back. Fortunately, those days have passed, and I will never dream of that night again.",
  "str_voice_1601291_5": "Are you looking at my cloak? If you must know, I painted it myself. If you like it, I can paint a copy for you when I finish processing this commission.",
  "str_voice_1601291_50": "The Commander is not only a wonderful father, he is also a competent leader. Under his instruction, I have come to fully understand that he who speaks without conviction can never succeed.",
  "str_voice_1601291_51": "Are you curious about the origin of my ability? It's actually very simple—because I respect life, and life respects me. I live in peace with all life.",
  "str_voice_1601291_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1601291_53": "Hello.",
  "str_voice_1601291_54": "Morning, I'm already at work. You must be working, too.",
  "str_voice_1601291_55": "When noon comes, you should immerse yourself in nature's aura.",
  "str_voice_1601291_56": "Good night. May my insects sleep at your side.",
  "str_voice_1601291_57": "Happy New Year! I hope everything goes ever more smoothly in the new year.",
  "str_voice_1601291_6": "The White Flame Mercenaries survive in Umbraton through their credibility. This makes us very different from organizations and nations guided by public power.",
  "str_voice_1601291_7": "Are you... looking at my mask? I have been wearing it since I was very young. It was a souvenir left to me by my senior.",
  "str_voice_1601291_8": "I used to be so disgusted with underground dealings... but I have outgrown those feelings. Cooperation with them brought us much more profit. Moreover, many of my men still rely on this to fill their bellies.",
  "str_voice_1601291_9": "Can I paint a portrait for you? Don't underestimate my painting skills. Sometimes, I can even make deals with underground gangs through my artwork.",
  "str_voice_1601311_1": "Living a life without rituals is like traveling in the dark on a night without stars... How boring is that?",
  "str_voice_1601311_10": "Are you bored? I can tell you some stories about the history of Northland. Maybe it will entertain you for a while.",
  "str_voice_1601311_11": "A nomination process with a strong sense of tradition? Haha, I'm happy to oblige.",
  "str_voice_1601311_12": "Sometimes I can hear the mountains and rivers talking to me. They speak so slowly, but they sound so alluring.",
  "str_voice_1601311_13": "Be careful, Even these furry white rabbits will bite if they get angry.",
  "str_voice_1601311_14": "Every ordinary day is worth remembering.",
  "str_voice_1601311_15": "I have an ancient spell for you on this day that belongs exclusively to you—Happy Birthday!",
  "str_voice_1601311_16": "Yea, nothing has happened. This is the simplest form of happiness, don't you think?",
  "str_voice_1601311_17": "Stretch or take a deep breath... We can start a beautiful day with the simplest ritual.",
  "str_voice_1601311_18": "Have you finished your work? Maybe I can help you arrange a ritual to cleanse your soul?",
  "str_voice_1601311_19": "Oh... Why haven't you slept yet even though it's so late? Could you be doing a taboo ritual?",
  "str_voice_1601311_2": "Sssh... You'll scare the bunnies next to me if you're too loud.",
  "str_voice_1601311_20": "I am deeply grateful for every day that I get to live on this white land.",
  "str_voice_1601311_21": "Both Illumina and Lumopolis have their own way of survival.",
  "str_voice_1601311_22": "For the North.",
  "str_voice_1601311_23": "They are pathetic creatures who have brute force but no ability to think for themselves.",
  "str_voice_1601311_24": "People only see how strong the queen is, but nobody knows the price she has paid to protect Northland...",
  "str_voice_1601311_25": "Nikinis is impeccable when it comes to paying respects to her Majesty the Queen.",
  "str_voice_1601311_26": "Yea... It is because I grew up in a country of snow that I cherish the warmth of the sun even more.",
  "str_voice_1601311_27": "Haha, don't let me hear anyone speak ill about her Majesty the Queen.",
  "str_voice_1601311_28": "A giant object that appeared in historical records. I didn't expect to see the real thing in my lifetime.",
  "str_voice_1601311_29": "I am Novio, a citizen of Northland, and I have been waiting a long time for you. We have great weather today. Could it have anticipated your arrival and come to welcome you?",
  "str_voice_1601311_3": "The pages of history contain knowledge of events of the past and things that will happen in the future.",
  "str_voice_1601311_30": "Oh? This feels so warm...",
  "str_voice_1601311_31": "The healing flame burns in my heart.",
  "str_voice_1601311_32": "History... is taking place before our eyes.",
  "str_voice_1601311_33": "This growth is worth commemorating!",
  "str_voice_1601311_34": "Let's go.",
  "str_voice_1601311_35": "I am ready.",
  "str_voice_1601311_36": "I am waiting.",
  "str_voice_1601311_37": "I need a sense of ritual.",
  "str_voice_1601311_38": "Terra staff, grant me strength!",
  "str_voice_1601311_39": "I am always here.",
  "str_voice_1601311_4": "It isn't necessarily bad even if every day is the same. You must know that many of our compatriots have given their lives to give their descendants a stable future.",
  "str_voice_1601311_40": "Do not be afraid.",
  "str_voice_1601311_41": "It is my pleasure.",
  "str_voice_1601311_42": "A perfect ritual!",
  "str_voice_1601311_43": "A chapter of regret that can not be rewritten...",
  "str_voice_1601311_44": "I need to learn more about the history of this place.",
  "str_voice_1601311_45": "You are welcome.",
  "str_voice_1601311_46": "Sorry to trouble you.",
  "str_voice_1601311_47": "Did you prepare a long time for this?",
  "str_voice_1601311_48": "I need to think carefully about what to give you in return.",
  "str_voice_1601311_49": "Northland has not changed since then. Everyone other than me believed that I was the mountain spirit...",
  "str_voice_1601311_5": "Oh? Is there a new member in the rabbit family...? Wait patiently and be good, little rabbit, I'll prepare sweet carrots for everyone soon.",
  "str_voice_1601311_50": "How can we protect the people important to us and this peaceful land? I have been searching for an answer to this question for many years.",
  "str_voice_1601311_51": "This moment of tranquility is the most precious gift anyone can give me. I think I have found a way to protect Northland.",
  "str_voice_1601311_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1601311_53": "Oh?",
  "str_voice_1601311_54": "Ah, what a wonderful morning.",
  "str_voice_1601311_55": "Are you feeling weary?",
  "str_voice_1601311_56": "Now then, good night.",
  "str_voice_1601311_57": "I wish you a happy and peaceful year.",
  "str_voice_1601311_6": "With great power comes great responsibility. I won't run away from my responsibilities or forget my original intentions. My desire to protect the Northland only grows stronger.",
  "str_voice_1601311_7": "You don't need to be so cautious. Just ask me if you have any questions, and I will do my best to give you a satisfactory answer.",
  "str_voice_1601311_8": "Sometimes, your good qualities remind me of an old friend I haven't seen in a long time... I wish I could see her again.",
  "str_voice_1601311_9": "It is quite simple to develop a sense of ritual. For example... we can make the day we met the anniversary of our friendship.",
  "str_voice_1601331_1": "That's correct, I'm a maid, but not your maid!",
  "str_voice_1601331_10": "Yawn... I can't sleep, there's still laundry to do...",
  "str_voice_1601331_11": "Copy that! Housekeeping is my specialty!",
  "str_voice_1601331_12": "My outfit is actually transformed from my scales, so I don't need to change it every day!",
  "str_voice_1601331_13": "Oh, I want to stretch a little... Don't worry, I won't level this place.",
  "str_voice_1601331_14": "My tail is very delectable! But why does Kobayashi keep refusing to eat it?",
  "str_voice_1601331_15": "Surprise! I know this is an important day for you!",
  "str_voice_1601331_16": "You're here! Any plans for the day?",
  "str_voice_1601331_17": "What a nice day! And us maids have to get working from the crack of dawn!",
  "str_voice_1601331_18": "How time flies...",
  "str_voice_1601331_19": "Hope I'll dream of Kobayashi again!",
  "str_voice_1601331_2": "You want a ride? No way, my back is for Kobayashi only!",
  "str_voice_1601331_20": "You can let it all out in this world. My friends would definitely love it here!",
  "str_voice_1601331_21": "Constant battles and casualties, regardless of which world. How pitiful.",
  "str_voice_1601331_22": "For Kobayashi, conquer the new world!",
  "str_voice_1601331_23": "What, so there is this race even more inferior and ignorant than humans...",
  "str_voice_1601331_24": "Fafnir? Well, that's how he is.",
  "str_voice_1601331_25": "Tsk, even Elma followed. Just can't get rid of her...",
  "str_voice_1601331_26": "L-Luckily, I hid one of Kobayashi's towels! Smells just like her! Thanks!",
  "str_voice_1601331_27": "I hate eggs without yolk. It's the thing that killed my friend Khresug!",
  "str_voice_1601331_28": "Is he a dragon too? Hey, still alive?",
  "str_voice_1601331_29": "Excuse me, my name is Tohru, Kobayashi's maid. May I ask if you know where my master is?",
  "str_voice_1601331_3": "So boring!! Is there no housework for me to do?",
  "str_voice_1601331_30": "Hey, I feel energized!",
  "str_voice_1601331_31": "Roar! Hee, just trying to spook you.",
  "str_voice_1601331_32": "Do you want to witness my true form?",
  "str_voice_1601331_33": "I heard somebody is begging for destruction!",
  "str_voice_1601331_34": "Hooray! Let's go!",
  "str_voice_1601331_35": "Warmup's over.",
  "str_voice_1601331_36": "Isn't it hot?",
  "str_voice_1601331_37": "Gone from my sight, now!",
  "str_voice_1601331_38": "Burn with the whole world!",
  "str_voice_1601331_39": "Why run?",
  "str_voice_1601331_4": "Scared? Are dragons rare in this world?",
  "str_voice_1601331_40": "Again! Again!",
  "str_voice_1601331_41": "I got this!",
  "str_voice_1601331_42": "Easy peasy!",
  "str_voice_1601331_43": "No, this can't be it...",
  "str_voice_1601331_44": "It's much bigger than Kobayashi's house!",
  "str_voice_1601331_45": "Whoa, a present? That's unusual.",
  "str_voice_1601331_46": "Oh, this is nice!",
  "str_voice_1601331_47": "Thanks! But don't expect any gift in return.",
  "str_voice_1601331_48": "Ohhhhh! From now on, you are my best friend!",
  "str_voice_1601331_49": "I wanted to seek out ingredients in another world, but guess I messed up the transition.",
  "str_voice_1601331_5": "Better stay away from me now! My instinct tells me it doesn't like you.",
  "str_voice_1601331_50": "It's been eons since I fought a battle! I'm itching to fight again, so count me in!",
  "str_voice_1601331_51": "I think I smelled Kanna. This is not a peaceful world so I'm worried about her.",
  "str_voice_1601331_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1601331_53": "Hey!",
  "str_voice_1601331_54": "Morning!",
  "str_voice_1601331_55": "Lunchtime!",
  "str_voice_1601331_56": "Yawn... Good night.",
  "str_voice_1601331_57": "Happy new year. Kobayashi doesn't have to work overtime today, right?",
  "str_voice_1601331_6": "What, you quit? But I haven't had enough yet!",
  "str_voice_1601331_7": "Kobayashi?! Oh wait, It's you.",
  "str_voice_1601331_8": "I'm used to worlds like this. Here is not the best, but at least tolerable.",
  "str_voice_1601331_9": "Welcome home! The meal is ready. Remember, leftovers will make me mad!",
  "str_voice_1601341_1": "I want to go to school. I have friends in school and the classes are fun.",
  "str_voice_1601341_10": "One little ant... Two little ants...",
  "str_voice_1601341_11": "My eyes are glued to you.",
  "str_voice_1601341_12": "I can make lightning. See, isn't it cool?",
  "str_voice_1601341_13": "Hungry... When is the next meal?",
  "str_voice_1601341_14": "I know, unruly kids get kicked out of the house...",
  "str_voice_1601341_15": "Happy birthday. Can I spend it with you?",
  "str_voice_1601341_16": "Fun is on the schedule today. Well, fun is on the schedule every day.",
  "str_voice_1601341_17": "Morning. Yawn... So sleepy. Good night.",
  "str_voice_1601341_18": "It's dark. Tohru said glowing bugs come out at night. I want to catch some. Should be delicious.",
  "str_voice_1601341_19": "Where are you taking me to hang out tomorrow? I can't wait!",
  "str_voice_1601341_2": "So tired... Power off...",
  "str_voice_1601341_20": "Everybody is so kind and gentle. I like being with everyone.",
  "str_voice_1601341_21": "Can I be friends with you all?",
  "str_voice_1601341_22": "A new world to conquer.",
  "str_voice_1601341_23": "Can't eat these or I'll get a stomach ache.",
  "str_voice_1601341_24": "Tohru looks after me. I like Tohru.",
  "str_voice_1601341_25": "Kobayashi told me Fafnir is an Otaku. What is an Otaku?",
  "str_voice_1601341_26": "Cute things, I like. Pretty things, I like.",
  "str_voice_1601341_27": "It's boring by myself. I don't want boring.",
  "str_voice_1601341_28": "A big fellow! Can he be my new friend?",
  "str_voice_1601341_29": "I'm Kanna. I'm lost. And hungry. Got anything to eat? Okay, I'll follow you.",
  "str_voice_1601341_3": "Oh, wicked, that's wicked.",
  "str_voice_1601341_30": "Recharged.",
  "str_voice_1601341_31": "Can I use more power?",
  "str_voice_1601341_32": "Time to get serious.",
  "str_voice_1601341_33": "I'm bored, now disappear.",
  "str_voice_1601341_34": "I'll put more effort into it.",
  "str_voice_1601341_35": "I am ready!",
  "str_voice_1601341_36": "Look, look.",
  "str_voice_1601341_37": "Kanna won't lose.",
  "str_voice_1601341_38": "Impale and eliminate.",
  "str_voice_1601341_39": "Here comes the lightning.",
  "str_voice_1601341_4": "Can I eat this? I want to eat this.",
  "str_voice_1601341_40": "Kkkkkrack!",
  "str_voice_1601341_41": "Behave, everyone.",
  "str_voice_1601341_42": "Well done, everybody.",
  "str_voice_1601341_43": "This is not fun...",
  "str_voice_1601341_44": "I'm free, just waiting for someone to play with me.",
  "str_voice_1601341_45": "A present! I love presents!",
  "str_voice_1601341_46": "Oh, so cute!",
  "str_voice_1601341_47": "Thanks! Are there any more?",
  "str_voice_1601341_48": "I love it! The present and you both!",
  "str_voice_1601341_49": "Got lost on the way home, ended up in the woods.",
  "str_voice_1601341_5": "I want to go out and play! Go out and play!",
  "str_voice_1601341_50": "Saw a lot of food I've never seen before. So interesting.",
  "str_voice_1601341_51": "Saw a dragon flying in the sky. It looked familiar, so I followed.",
  "str_voice_1601341_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1601341_53": "Hello.",
  "str_voice_1601341_54": "Good morning.",
  "str_voice_1601341_55": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_voice_1601341_56": "Good night.",
  "str_voice_1601341_57": "Happy new year! Have you made any wishes? My wish is... Wait, Kobayashi said I can't tell anyone what my wish is.",
  "str_voice_1601341_6": "Tohru said, do away with the annoying people.",
  "str_voice_1601341_7": "People in this world are interesting too.",
  "str_voice_1601341_8": "Busy again today? Got it.",
  "str_voice_1601341_9": "Hang out with me! No excuses. Hang out with me!",
  "str_voice_1601381_1": "If you find any ancient relics, I suggest you hand them to the Illumina Research Center because it's the only place capable of restoring them. But of course, it'd be best if you could give them to me.",
  "str_voice_1601381_10": "I have an idea! If there isn't much to do, why don't we take off early and have a few drinks? And maybe even some spicy skewers... Yummy!",
  "str_voice_1601381_11": "Thanks for inviting me for the research work... Huh? You mean there's no research work required? Wow, there aren't many jobs like that around anymore!",
  "str_voice_1601381_12": "What I'd like to find is neither gold nor silver nor jewelry, but something much more valuable.",
  "str_voice_1601381_13": "They say that I never get drunk, but that's a bit of an exaggeration.",
  "str_voice_1601381_14": "Spider? Ahh, that's my little pet spider.",
  "str_voice_1601381_15": "Is today your birthday? I'll definitely celebrate with you after work, so remember to save me a seat!",
  "str_voice_1601381_16": "Is something bothering you at work? You can always talk to me about it. After all, there's nothing I can't solve.",

  "str_voice_1601381_18": "Yep... I just finished work. Would you like to have a drink after this?",
  "str_voice_1601381_19": "People stay up after midnight for one of two reasons: Because they choose to or because they have to. Which description fits you?",
  "str_voice_1601381_2": "Though I believe in science, it doesn't explain everything. For example, if you're looking to locate a valuable ruin... it may just boil down to pure luck.",
  "str_voice_1601381_20": "Illumina not only taught me how to do research, but also provided me with the freedom to do so.",
  "str_voice_1601381_21": "Gosh, I can't understand how the people of Lumopolis think. Even if they don't know how to appreciate the relics, there's no need to destroy them!",

  "str_voice_1601381_28": "Look at its aerodynamic designs and its glittering texture... There must be an amazing story behind this huge flying machine.",
  "str_voice_1601381_29": "Body shape, facial features, hair, height, clothing style... That's right, you must be a Caelestite! I'm Siobhan, and I'm really excited to study you!",
  "str_voice_1601381_3": "Ancient relics can talk. I mean, not literally, obviously! They convey their messages through the traces left behind.",

  "str_voice_1601381_44": "Are you talking about that? Why don't I explain it to you?",

  "str_voice_1601381_46": "How could you possibly know what I want...?",
  "str_voice_1601381_47": "This isn't something you can come by easily... What? It's for me?",
  "str_voice_1601381_48": "Caelestites really understand the hearts of others.",
  "str_voice_1601381_49": "I still remember... the end of that cold, damp pit, where the ancient ruins first appeared before my eyes. Such mystery and thrill!",
  "str_voice_1601381_5": "How could someone who created such a glorious, ancient civiliazation just disappear? I'm still trying to figure that out.",
  "str_voice_1601381_50": "My most memorable birthday...? There was a year when many adults I didn't know came to me with flowers. However, what they prepared for me wasn't a birthday gift...",
  "str_voice_1601381_51": "I want to be as brave as father, and as focused as mother. If it's for the sake of my beloved cause, even if I were to fall one day, I'll have no regrets.",

  "str_voice_1601381_57": "Happy New Year! I guess it's time for a vacation.",
  "str_voice_1601381_6": "To work is to solve a problem, and the worst thing you can do when solving problems is to get emotional. But of course, you're more than welcome to spill it all once you're off work.",

  "str_voice_1601381_9": "I don't actually wear a mask all the time. Does it really interest you that much? Anyway, I don't think we should talk about this now. Let's talk about it after work, alright?",
  "str_voice_1601401_1": "It's a very different sword, isn't it? It's a Winding Sword specially ordered for me by my parents, and it cost a lot of money. If you look at it sideways like this, doesn't it resemble a snake?",
  "str_voice_1601401_10": "If it's all right, could I practice my sword here for a while? I don't want this time to go to waste.",
  "str_voice_1601401_11": "Are there investigations here, too? Ohh, it's something different... Well, no matter. Since I'm here already, I promise to do my best!",
  "str_voice_1601401_12": "You like reading, too? But it better not be those boring romance novels.",
  "str_voice_1601401_13": "Your lips are chapped, and your skin looks dry. Did you forget to drink water again?",
  "str_voice_1601401_14": "A true knight never gives up without a fight. That's what I've been telling myself since I was a kid.",
  "str_voice_1601401_15": "Happy birthday! How do I know it's your birthday? Well, I notice things every now and then...",
  "str_voice_1601401_16": "Aren't we exercising and resting in order to be able to continue working hard?",
  "str_voice_1601401_17": "It's best to drink a glass of warm water first thing in the morning. It has to be warm water, or you'll easily get an upset stomach.",
  "str_voice_1601401_18": "You better not engage in strenuous exercises at this hour, and remember not to eat or drink too much.",
  "str_voice_1601401_19": "First, lie down on the bed, and second, turn off your entertainment devices. If you're still unable to sleep, then it qualifies as insomnia.",

  "str_voice_1601401_29": "White Night up high! I'm Florine. I've heard a lot about you, but do forgive me, as I needed to be sure before coming to a conclusion.",
  "str_voice_1601401_3": "My life is dedicated to carrying out missions. What? The mission this time is to take a day off?",

  "str_voice_1601411_1": "On we go! Where to? To explore the unknown, of course! Don't tell me you aren't the least bit interested?",
  "str_voice_1601411_10": "Uhh, umm... You, talk to me... If this goes on, I'll be no different from a buried antique...",
  "str_voice_1601411_11": "Hi there! Mind if I look around a little? Wait... I've forgotten to bring my expedition gear!",
  "str_voice_1601411_12": "The fireflies on Colossus... Can I use it as a ball? I'm in the mood to play...",

  "str_voice_1601411_18": "Hey, I'm recording today's adventure! Huh? My handwriting's hard to read? That's not important!",
  "str_voice_1601411_19": "You're going to look unsightly if you stay up late... Well, if you aren't going to sleep, I'll go ahead first.",
  "str_voice_1601411_2": "Come, let me introduce you. This is Bently and Lompty. Ohh, you can't tell them apart? Look here... Bently's the thinner one and Lompty's the chubby one.",
  "str_voice_1601411_20": "Freedom, joy, and my family... Rediesel Wrench is forever my home.",
  "str_voice_1601411_21": "Illumina actually owns so many ancient ruins?! But their lives sound exceedingly dull.",
  "str_voice_1601411_22": "Live life to the fullest! The sky's the limit!",
  "str_voice_1601411_23": "These Eclipsites are always getting in the way of my adventure. They must be dealt with!",
  "str_voice_1601411_24": "Actually... I really wish Rouge had a dream of her own instead of following me around all the time.",
  "str_voice_1601411_25": "Is it weird that Odi is my master? Although she's younger than me, she's very knowledgeable.",
  "str_voice_1601411_26": "I like lots of things, but I guess if I could only pick one, it'll be—adventures!",
  "str_voice_1601411_27": "As long as I don't have to be stuck at home with nothing to do, everything else is fine!",
  "str_voice_1601411_28": "Flying's cool and all, but you can't explore every corner of the continent from the sky alone...",
  "str_voice_1601411_29": "Hey there, the name's Ruby and my dream is to explore every corner of the map! Do you do a lot of exploring yourself? If so, we've got loads to talk about!",
  "str_voice_1601411_3": "Strange, where did I put my bat? It was just here... How could it disappear? What did you say? It's just m—Oh, there it is! Hahaha...",
  "str_voice_1601411_30": "My blood's boiling!",
  "str_voice_1601411_31": "What an incredible feeling!",

  "str_voice_1601411_35": "Ready when you are!",
  "str_voice_1601411_36": "You won't forget me, will you?",
  "str_voice_1601411_37": "Nice shot!",
  "str_voice_1601411_38": "Super-duper bat strike!",
  "str_voice_1601411_39": "Magnificent shot!",
  "str_voice_1601411_4": "Don't underestimate my expedition pack. I have tools, medicines, rations, water... Oh, meet Bently and Lompty... my special equipment. Heheh.",
  "str_voice_1601411_40": "Strike it!",
  "str_voice_1601411_41": "Now that's a piece of cake!",
  "str_voice_1601411_42": "Where's my applause?",
  "str_voice_1601411_43": "One... one more round!",
  "str_voice_1601411_44": "Another adventure?! I'll... Huh, aren't you going?",
  "str_voice_1601411_45": "Ohh... for me?",
  "str_voice_1601411_46": "Hahaha, you really do know me!",
  "str_voice_1601411_47": "Hey, is this expensive?",
  "str_voice_1601411_48": "I absolutely love this!",
  "str_voice_1601411_49": "I have always been around Rediesel Wrench fellas for as long as I can remember... Fighting, driving, hunting... Eating loads of meat and singing all the time.",
  "str_voice_1601411_5": "I've just got a brilliant idea! Can I tie my car to the exterior of your Colossus? That way, it'll be able to fly!",
  "str_voice_1601411_50": "Passion alone isn't enough for adventures. It takes all kinds of knowledge and practice... I made the same mistake myself.",
  "str_voice_1601411_51": "To be honest, when I said goodbye to my mother and started the car, I nearly cried. But then I realized there was someone else in the car.",

  "str_voice_1601411_6": "Hahaha, stop it...! Oh, I'm sorry, Bently and Lompty were tickling me just now. Hey, you two, get out of my coat!",
  "str_voice_1601411_7": "According to my mother, I was born in a Rediesel Wrench wagon. Everyone thought it was pretty cool. What do you think?",
  "str_voice_1601411_8": "I searched everywhere, and all this time, Bently and Lompty were hiding on you?! That's strange, they're rarely comfortable with others...",
  "str_voice_1601411_9": "\"Lalala! Doo bee doo bee doo!\" Hey, do you know this song? Oh! You're a fan of Barbara too? Here, let's share the ear pods!",

  "str_voice_1601431_10": "Oh... The Navigator is absentminded? Laziness is one kind of vile presence too. Do you need my cleansing spell?",
  "str_voice_1601431_11": "Ahh... The work here is very different from my priestess training.",

  "str_voice_1601481_16": "Want to go intel-hunting with me? Investigating the situation on the ground is the first step in any exploration.",

  "str_voice_1601481_18": "*Yawn* Time to find a place to chill for a while. Wanna come? Better make up your mind fast, I'm not waiting.",
  "str_voice_1601481_19": "How disappointing. I was hoping to catch a look at your cute little face sleeping like a baby... But since you're awake... The night is young, if you know what I mean.",
  "str_voice_1601481_2": "Well, you seem to be close with the girls from both Illumina and Lumopolis. You really are something, aren't ya? Better watch yourself, Mr. Popular, you don't want to do anything crazy.",
  "str_voice_1601481_20": "The Rediesel Wrench is my family. Although I don't go back often, this bond... it carries me further.",
  "str_voice_1601481_21": "I've got more history with those buggers than I could cover over just a drink or two.",
  "str_voice_1601481_22": "Live life to the fullest? I guess.",
  "str_voice_1601481_23": "The Eclipsites... I wish those bags of slime never existed.",
  "str_voice_1601481_24": "Jona is the only one in the entire Rediesel Wrench who can keep up with me when we're drinking. Roy? He has no manners when he's drunk.",

  "str_voice_1601481_26": "What I like? Cute boys, of course. Don't worry, I'm not gonna eat you whole... Not yet, anyway.",
  "str_voice_1601481_27": "I heard that Lumopolis and Illumina have a lot of rules and restrictions... Just the thought of it makes me feel like I'm suffocating.",
  "str_voice_1601481_28": "The Colossus is huge, but you keep it in pristine condition... I can tell you care about it a lot.",
  "str_voice_1601481_29": "Ah hah! You must be the Caelestite they've been talking about. I gotta say you've got a cute face for someone with such a dorky name. Move closer, would you?",
  "str_voice_1601481_3": "I prefer to work alone. No one to hold me back, and no one to disappoint... Lonely? Not at all. I've got the stars above shining just for me, and the wild wind singing me songs.",

  "str_voice_1601481_4": "I've operated all kinds of vehicles, but a flying Colossus? Now that's the first I've seen of one. What I'd give to pilot one. Oh, landing is the hardest part? You don't say...",
  "str_voice_1601481_40": "Cool off!",
  "str_voice_1601481_41": "Sure. But how are you going to repay me?",
  "str_voice_1601481_42": "So how do you intend on repaying me?",
  "str_voice_1601481_43": "Again! Don't stop!",
  "str_voice_1601481_44": "How about we take a ride in your Colossus?",
  "str_voice_1601481_45": "I bet you've given this to many beautiful girls before, haven't ya?",
  "str_voice_1601481_46": "Wow, you really know what I like. I bet you're looking for something in return, aren't ya?",
  "str_voice_1601481_47": "Thanks, how sweet. Lean over. Mmmwah!",
  "str_voice_1601481_48": "How considerate. I'm gonna take this seriously, you know? You shouldn't tease grown-ups.",
  "str_voice_1601481_49": "I started playing with firearms when I was still in the womb! Sadly, there's no one left to attest to that...",
  "str_voice_1601481_5": "Hey, mind showing off your... \"psychic ability\" to me a bit? Tell me what I'm thinking right now. Wait, you're scared already? Oh, how boring.",
  "str_voice_1601481_50": "Can you imagine the desperation of dragging yourself through the endless desert, unable to find your way home... or the person you once were?",
  "str_voice_1601481_51": "I don't want history to repeat itself... Now, the Rediesel Wrench is my home, and I'll protect it in my own way.",

  "str_voice_1601481_6": "Since they all call you the \"Navigator,\" why don't you come and be my navigator at the next Blazing Rally? Mine, and mine alone... heheh. You're blushing!",
  "str_voice_1601481_7": "Unlike those boring guys who just stare at me from a distance, you're not afraid of getting up close and personal. You deserve a reward... So, come closer.",
  "str_voice_1601481_8": "I did say I prefer to work alone, but if you ever need a place to take a breather, my passenger seat doesn't have anyone in it.",
  "str_voice_1601481_9": "It's been a long time since someone called me by my real name, Safia... Can you just say it to me one more time? Just pretend I'm drunk.",
  "str_voice_1601481_99": "How will you repay me after the show?",
  "str_voice_1601484_1": "I don't like to spend too long in one place. So this agency, it's just for funsies.",
  "str_voice_1601484_10": "Yawn... I'm tired. I'm gonna go take a nap. If any clients turn up, come and get me. And if I catch you slacking off... well, you know what'll happen.",
  "str_voice_1601484_11": "My parents once told me that a good hunter excels in camouflage and patience. That's why I have to dress like this and wait here. It's dull, though.",
  "str_voice_1601484_12": "This top is a little tight, so I undid a few buttons. What? Why not? Come on, explain carefully, or how am I meant to understand?",
  "str_voice_1601484_13": "When exchanging intel, you need to know the value of what you have. Of course, having a gun helps.",
  "str_voice_1601484_14": "Hmm. Okay, you know how to win my favor. You're just barely qualified to serve as my assistant. If you put in some more effort, I may even reward you.",
  "str_voice_1601484_16": "Our client's almost here. Focus, or I won't be responsible if a bullet grazes your cheek.",
  "str_voice_1601484_17": "How should I punish you for being late? Hmm... Maybe I should use you as a chair?",
  "str_voice_1601484_18": "Okay, time to wrap up for the day. Why are you in such a rush? Got a hot date waiting for you?",
  "str_voice_1601484_19": "My, what are you doing here at this time? Did you come to see me?",
  "str_voice_1601484_2": "The more I drink, the better shot I am. Wanna see for yourself? Great, stand over there and put this tin on your head.",
  "str_voice_1601484_3": "This gun isn't as good as the Eye of the Lynx, but it's not bad. I'll let you play with it when I'm done over here. Don't you want to?",
  "str_voice_1601484_35": "You know what to do, right?",
  "str_voice_1601484_36": "Carefully, earnestly...",
  "str_voice_1601484_37": "Blockade in place!",

  "str_voice_1601484_65": "Are you still awake, little Caelestite?",
  "str_voice_1601484_66": "Evening. What's on your mind?",
  "str_voice_1601484_67": "I do everything my own way, even work. Life is dull otherwise.",
  "str_voice_1601484_68": "A small drink makes everything better.",
  "str_voice_1601484_69": "Heheh. Surely you can stand a bit of teasing?",
  "str_voice_1601484_70": "I have only one goal: to protect my found family.",
  "str_voice_1601484_71": "Oh my. I think I might be falling for you.",
  "str_voice_1601501_1": "Lenore is very obedient. But now, Lenore doesn't listen to everyone. Does that make Lenore rebellious now?",
  "str_voice_1601501_10": "Stay put, don't move. Lenore's very good at this kind of order. Lenore used to stay put in the house and look after Mother and May's home.",
  "str_voice_1601501_11": "Understood. Lenore will fulfill all Navigator's orders.",
  "str_voice_1601501_12": "Sometime May comes to Lenore's mind. Lenore thinks... May must be brushing the white cat's hair. May doesn't like tangled hair.",

  "str_voice_1601533_60": "Are you up? If you want to attend the banquet, you'd better start preparing from the crack of dawn.",
  "str_voice_1601533_61": "Have you been eating well? Gourmet food is so hard to come by.",
  "str_voice_1601533_62": "This is when the sun shines the brightest. I hope one day Gannon can bask in its glory too.",

  "str_voice_1601541_1": "Hehe... Oh, it's nothing. I just remembered how I mistook you for some weird ghost when we first met... Geez, I didn't realize that was so long ago.",
  "str_voice_1601541_10": "Okay, enough rest for me. I know it's for my own good, but we've got to get to work now, alright?",
  "str_voice_1601541_11": "Of course I can help, but there's nothing to fix here... You mean I should take a break here?",
  "str_voice_1601541_12": "Thorough planning and diligent training always pays off! So, when do you plan on handing me your next month's agenda?",
  "str_voice_1601541_13": "A holiday? Ahem. Well, that's not entirely impossible. I'm looking forward to some fun myself, but we have to wrap up a few more tasks first. Let me go sort out our budget right now!",
  "str_voice_1601541_14": "Done with your planning? What's that? You made one for the Colossus but not for Eraveil? Don't neglect your duties, PlayerName!",
  "str_voice_1601541_15": "Happy birthday! I look forward to bearing witness to your hard word for yet another year, hehe.",
  "str_voice_1601541_16": "Don't work too hard. Sometimes you just gotta let go. It's important to strike a proper balance between work and play.",
  "str_voice_1601541_17": "Morning! This is today's agenda. Please sign off on it, PlayerName!",
  "str_voice_1601541_18": "Phew, it's finally over! You're still working? Anything I can help with?",
  "str_voice_1601541_19": "Still up? Have you maybe found yourself in a pickle? Don't worry, let me help you.",
  "str_voice_1601541_2": "Do you think I'm... different? Honestly, I often startle myself when I look in the mirror, but I also feel full of energy. That's a good thing for us, right? Yeah, I said us!",
  "str_voice_1601541_20": "Illumina probably has secrets I'm unaware of, but I can guarantee you there are no conspiracies. Such a thing would never happen in Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1601541_21": "I used to think the Rediesel Wrench was just a bunch of desperados. Now I know they're actually nice people.",
  "str_voice_1601541_22": "Splendor Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1601541_23": "I don't particularly enjoy slaughter, but there's no other way to deal with Eclipsites.",
  "str_voice_1601541_24": "He's not a good fighter, but he's very smart, courageous, and hardworking... What's that? Oh, I'm just introducing a... good friend of mine.",
  "str_voice_1601541_25": "Carleen has always been so intelligent, calm, and mature, but I've come to realize lately that she's just been intentionally concealing her childish side.",
  "str_voice_1601541_26": "White dawn flowers, pink cherry blossoms, seaside smoothies and honey cakes in the snow... There are so many more things I like now.",
  "str_voice_1601541_27": "Things I couldn't stand in the past now don't seem that bad anymore... Does this mean I've matured?",
  "str_voice_1601541_28": "Soroz is starting to feel like home. Hehe, I can't be the only one feeling that way, right?",
  "str_voice_1601541_29": "Why are you looking at me like that? Have I changed that much? Don't worry, I'm the same Vice, I promise!",
  "str_voice_1601541_3": "Peace didn't last in Astra. We're being pulled into a maelstrom as we speak. Don't worry, PlayerName, I'll always be by your side!",
  "str_voice_1601541_30": "An even icier, cold strength!",
  "str_voice_1601541_31": "Work harder, go further!",
  "str_voice_1601541_32": "The future will reward us for today's decision!",
  "str_voice_1601541_33": "My sealed potential has finally been unleashed!",
  "str_voice_1601541_34": "I'll work even harder!",
  "str_voice_1601541_35": "Send me!",
  "str_voice_1601541_36": "No time to waste!",
  "str_voice_1601541_37": "Now is the time! Take that!",
  "str_voice_1601541_38": "Soon it will be over!",
  "str_voice_1601541_39": "One shot is all I need!",
  "str_voice_1601541_4": "Sometimes it seems that the more I know, the more I don't... Geez, what am I rambling about? Gues I'm becoming more like you!",
  "str_voice_1601541_40": "Strike, ice arrow!",
  "str_voice_1601541_41": "As always, you lead!",
  "str_voice_1601541_42": "A textbook-perfect battle!",
  "str_voice_1601541_43": "It's okay, we'll get another chance!",
  "str_voice_1601541_44": "Hmm, let me check the to-do list... Colossus maintenance, grocery shopping, daily planning... Yep, another busy day!",
  "str_voice_1601541_45": "Hey, a gift from an old partner!",
  "str_voice_1601541_46": "Where did you get this? Thank you so much!",
  "str_voice_1601541_47": "You don't have to be so generous!",
  "str_voice_1601541_48": "Wow, I've always wanted this... Thanks!",
  "str_voice_1601541_49": "If I hadn't saved you from underground back then, I probably wouldn't be here now... We make a great duo, don't you think?",
  "str_voice_1601541_5": "Since I got stronger, doesn't this mean my cooking should've improved as well? So, PlayerName, what would you like to eat? Just name it!",
  "str_voice_1601541_50": "Those memories had disappeared into the deep chasm of my mind... But now they've suddenly resurfaced, coming back into focus. My mind is blank and there's a buzzing in my ears... I can't believe I once lived like that.",
  "str_voice_1601541_51": "Our adventures in Astra have been a thrill! But I never doubted we could overcome the hardships and perils. I'd love to see more of this world with you, if I may.",
  "str_voice_1601541_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1601541_53": "How are you, PlayerName?",
  "str_voice_1601541_54": "Morning. Are you awake?",
  "str_voice_1601541_55": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_voice_1601541_56": "Good evening. You must be tired after such a long day.",
  "str_voice_1601541_57": "Another year has begun. Let's keep striving together!",
  "str_voice_1601541_6": "Unlike Eclipsites, we pursue power to protect those who need us. I have faith in myself, so please, have faith in me as well!",
  "str_voice_1601541_7": "To my surprise, the dark suits me... I'm talking about clothing! Which one looks better on me, black or white?",
  "str_voice_1601541_8": "I've been practicing an instrument lately. What else? The piano, of course! Shall we play a duet together?",
  "str_voice_1601541_9": "I probably have changed. I've become greedier because I have more people to protect now, including you. So, I'm fine with this kind of greed.",
  "str_voice_1601551_1": "Don't tell me that my appearance scares you? There are people with alligator heads and dog tails walking around every day on the Colossus and you think I'm the weird one?",
  "str_voice_1601551_10": "Hey, I've played three rounds of wargames in my head already. What's taking you so long?",
  "str_voice_1601551_11": "Ha, you're starting to come to me voluntarily for training now? You've made quite the improvement.",
  "str_voice_1601551_12": "Is that an essay? How's writing that going to help you win battles? I advise you to go for a run instead, so at least you'll have a chance of getting away from a powerful foe!",
  "str_voice_1601551_13": "Having friends in every corner of the world doesn't make your journey any easier. More relationships often means more conflicts. Don't say I never warned you.",
  "str_voice_1601551_14": "You wanna know how I put up with boredom? What makes you think I can? It's just that there aren't really many opportunities to feel bored lately.",
  "str_voice_1601551_15": "It's your birthday today? Come, going to the front line will get your adrenaline pumping!",
  "str_voice_1601551_16": "Ugh, why does a commander still have to deal with stupid paperwork?",
  "str_voice_1601551_17": "You're up early. Is it because you want to train with me? You could've just told me...",
  "str_voice_1601551_18": "Finally, downtime for me! Think I'll practice fencing before bed. Wanna join me?",
  "str_voice_1601551_19": "Still up? Don't just space out. Come spar with me!",
  "str_voice_1601551_2": "This year's rookies are the absolute worst I've ever trained! Children who grew up in peacetime are completely lacking in wariness!",
  "str_voice_1601551_20": "I don't know what the higher-ups are planning, but no one can stop me in battle as long as I'm in Illumina.",
  "str_voice_1601551_21": "Rediesel Wrench folks waste too much time on insignificant things. I could make better use of their skills.",
  "str_voice_1601551_22": "Splendor Illumina!",
  "str_voice_1601551_23": "Eclipsites are nothing more than brainless garbage, tch. What makes them bold enough to oppose us?",
  "str_voice_1601551_24": "Out of all the other commanders, only Hiiro strikes my fancy. Hey, I mean in terms of military expertise!",
  "str_voice_1601551_25": "Wrath always says she loves fair fights, but where can you find that in a war? How naive is that?",
  "str_voice_1601551_26": "See, I was born to fight! Fighting is the only thing that makes me feel alive!",
  "str_voice_1601551_27": "How can anyone waste their entire day drinking tea and reading the news? Sorry, that's just not for me!",
  "str_voice_1601551_28": "Your Colossus hasn't changed a bit. I don't see any scuffs or bullet holes or anything. Should I start by scratching it with my sword?",
  "str_voice_1601551_29": "It's only been a few days, yet you already don't recognize me? Well, I'll see you in a fight next time and show you my true form! Freaked you out, didn't I? Hahaha!",
  "str_voice_1601551_3": "Keep your back straight and head up high! There's no safe haven for you in a battle, get that into your heads!",
  "str_voice_1601551_30": "I can still get stronger! For sure!",
  "str_voice_1601551_31": "This is what I'm talking about!",
  "str_voice_1601551_32": "I could do this forever!",
  "str_voice_1601551_33": "Who's next?!",
  "str_voice_1601551_34": "Where's the fight?",
  "str_voice_1601551_35": "Hey, don't get in my way!",
  "str_voice_1601551_36": "Time to clean up!",
  "str_voice_1601551_37": "Come closer and have a taste of this!",
  "str_voice_1601551_38": "*Roaring*",
  "str_voice_1601551_39": "Panther's Prowl!",
  "str_voice_1601551_4": "I've tried so many weapons over the years, but nothing feels better than this pair of mergeable blades.",
  "str_voice_1601551_40": "Bring it on!",
  "str_voice_1601551_41": "Move, and make it quick!",
  "str_voice_1601551_42": "Charge and strike while the iron is hot!",
  "str_voice_1601551_43": "It's not time to give up yet!",
  "str_voice_1601551_44": "Feeling rusty? How about going a round or two with me?",
  "str_voice_1601551_45": "Very generous of you!",
  "str_voice_1601551_46": "Exactly what I need. Thanks!",
  "str_voice_1601551_47": "If you insist!",
  "str_voice_1601551_48": "Hmm, this is good stuff!",
  "str_voice_1601551_49": "Do soldiers need supervision all the time? Shouldn't you hold yourselves to high standards? I've been training myself since the day I put on this cap!",
  "str_voice_1601551_5": "Sneak attacks can be effective, but that's not my style these days. Not when I can easily defeat foes head-on. You wanna give it a shot?",
  "str_voice_1601551_50": "You were probably just an infant when I first met Reinhardt. I do miss those days, before those Committee bastards rubbed off on her.",
  "str_voice_1601551_51": "I've always said, soldiers can't cower in battle. We must always charge towards the enemy. This is what has gotten me to where I am now!",
  "str_voice_1601551_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1601551_53": "Hey, say something.",
  "str_voice_1601551_54": "Morning!",
  "str_voice_1601551_55": "It's noon already?",
  "str_voice_1601551_56": "Good evening!",
  "str_voice_1601551_57": "My wish for the new year is to wipe out the Eclipsites!",
  "str_voice_1601551_6": "I've come to realize that we can't control the power within us until we can overcome ourselves to truly harness it one day. Thank heavens I've done just that.",
  "str_voice_1601551_7": "If I recall correctly, you know a few of my soldiers, don't you? That's good. Oh yeah, White Dwarf rarely talks, but he never lets me down in a battle.",
  "str_voice_1601551_8": "You're the only one worthy of being my opponent in wargames.",
  "str_voice_1601551_9": "You are gifted at leading troops. Don't take that as a compliment, though. Natural talent is nothing to gloat about. I'd rather see your persistence and will to fight!",
  "str_voice_1601553_1": "You want to know about my past? Sit down, I have all the time in the world. When I was young... even I myself thought I was a bastard.",
  "str_voice_1601553_10": "Tired? That's okay. I can still run with you on my back. So, let's get going!",
  "str_voice_1601553_11": "Can't function without supervision? Well, lucky for you, supervising is my expertise!",
  "str_voice_1601553_12": "I've always believed that guns are more powerful than blades. Why do I use blades, then? It's a long story. Let's just say Officer Pango spent a lot of effort teaching me the art of the blade.",
  "str_voice_1601553_13": "It's probably not my place to say so, but you should cherish those around you. Don't let those who've helped you go too far. Keep them close, for those are your comrades.",
  "str_voice_1601553_14": "Why do I treat you special? I know a hero when I see one. I don't mind going to bat for you when the going gets tough.",
  "str_voice_1601553_16": "You think I can pilot the Colossus or something? Oh, you don't? Then what are you waiting for? Get us to the Eclipsites before my patience runs out!",
  "str_voice_1601553_17": "Get in line, you lazy bum!",
  "str_voice_1601553_18": "We used to all scramble to the mess hall at this time. If we dawdled around like you, we'd have starved.",
  "str_voice_1601553_19": "Sufficient sleep ensures a functioning soldier. Go to bed. I'll keep watch.",
  "str_voice_1601553_2": "The Eclipsites are here! The Eclipsites are here! Don't stop me. Somebody has to sound the bugle every now and then, or complacency will kill them!",
  "str_voice_1601553_3": "Have you heard of sharpened rounds? We polish them to the max and make sure they're usable at the same time. We save them for only the most dire of situations...",
  "str_voice_1601553_35": "My blade is unsheathed!",
  "str_voice_1601553_36": "No compromise!",
  "str_voice_1601553_37": "Steel shell!",
  "str_voice_1601553_38": "Sharpened alloy round!",
  "str_voice_1601553_39": "Obliterate them!",
  "str_voice_1601553_40": "Fire at will!",
  "str_voice_1601553_44": "Tired? Wanna have some fun?",
  "str_voice_1601553_58": "The 2nd Legion never retreats!",
  "str_voice_1601553_59": "Following orders is my job. Too bad I'm the rebellious type.",
  "str_voice_1601553_60": "Keep charging! We shall not stop until all Eclipsites are exterminated!",
  "str_voice_1601553_61": "Let's do a military simulation.",
  "str_voice_1601553_62": "Teenage girls are all monsters.",
  "str_voice_1601553_63": "Show them what you're made of!",
  "str_voice_1601553_64": "Dozed off accidentally. Good thing no one saw me.",
  "str_voice_1601553_65": "I can go faster. Barton, you can do it!",
  "str_voice_1601553_66": "Ah, interesting.",
  "str_voice_1601553_67": "I didn't expect that old man to be photogenic.",
  "str_voice_1601553_68": "Follow me and show them how Illuminans do it!",
  "str_voice_1601553_69": "Damn, you got the spotlight this time...",
  "str_voice_1601553_70": "Reinhardt's changed. They've all changed... It's gotten too complicated for me to comprehend...",
  "str_voice_1601553_71": "This is nothing. I haven't even used the sharpened rounds yet! I can't agree to it...",
  "str_voice_1601561_1": "A gentleman should take the initiative and greet a lady when he sees her... Hey! Are you listening? Listening to a lady's advice is also something a gentleman should do.",
  "str_voice_1601561_10": "You bring me here, then you just ignore me. How rude! Unless... Have I done something wrong? I don't care! I'm not going to apologize without any explanation!",
  "str_voice_1601561_11": "Why'd you bring me to such a slum... I mean, I'm not hating on it, dummy! But since you brought me here, y-you'd better keep your eyes on me!",
  "str_voice_1601561_12": "\"I Came Back to Life After Being Buried for Seventeen Years...\" You call that a horror story? Is this what commoners like these days?",
  "str_voice_1601561_13": "Ugh, a black lump... This is Rediesel barbecue? Even my dog wouldn't eat this! Don't make me—Ahhhh! Eh, wait. It's actually kind of good?",
  "str_voice_1601561_14": "Uncle Istvan keeps trying to get Papa to get back into the business, but honestly... Papa's just an aging homebody. Is he really as impressive as everyone else says?",
  "str_voice_1601561_15": "This is a leftover from my charity work, it's totally not a birthday present I prepared for you! Ah... But, h-happy birthday.",
  "str_voice_1601561_16": "What are you up to? It's not like I'm checking on you or anything! It's just, just... Never mind.",
  "str_voice_1601561_17": "Are you seriously still sleeping? No way am I waking you up myself... Huh? You're still sleeping? Wake up already!",
  "str_voice_1601561_18": "It's quite late already, are you... still working? Nothing, I'm busy too. It's not like I was feeling lonely or anything.",
  "str_voice_1601561_19": "AHH! Oh, it's you? Idiot, you nearly scared me half to death! I thought it was a ghost...",
  "str_voice_1601561_2": "For afternoon tea today, I'd like to have jasmine black tea and sugar-free scones. Huh? You want me to prepare them by myself? H-How does one do that... Never mind, I'm no longer in the mood for afternoon tea.",
  "str_voice_1601561_20": "Umbraton is my territory. Eh? I-It's not at all because Papa has been helping me...",
  "str_voice_1601561_21": "Lumopolis? Why would you want to go there? If you really want to though, I can let you stay at my family mansion for a day or two.",
  "str_voice_1601561_22": "I'm watching you!",
  "str_voice_1601561_23": "Eclipsite or not, anyone who dares to mess with me has got it coming!",
  "str_voice_1601561_24": "Well... I must admit that Bethel is as skilled as I am. But one day I'll be a million times better than her!",
  "str_voice_1601561_25": "Sanae looks so cute when she's nervous... Eh? I-I've never bullied her! I don't think...",
  "str_voice_1601561_26": "I like a lot of things, some of which you may have never even heard of.",
  "str_voice_1601561_27": "Me, afraid of ghosts? Nonsense, I love horror stories, why would I—AH! What was that, was it a ghost?",
  "str_voice_1601561_28": "So this is a Colossus... it's amazing! Hehe, give me some time and I'll build one too!",
  "str_voice_1601561_29": "So you're PlayerName? Hmph, with all the talk going around about you, I thought you'd look more special. I'm Nina Andersen, meeting me is your honor.",
  "str_voice_1601561_3": "I'm holding a \"parasol,\" not an \"umbrella\"! What's the difference? Oh, come on... I suppose learning to forgive a commoner's ignorance is part of my duties too.",
  "str_voice_1601561_30": "Everyone, watch and learn!",
  "str_voice_1601561_31": "Inspiration... emerges!",
  "str_voice_1601561_32": "Another fine weapon.",
  "str_voice_1601561_33": "I will only rely on... my own power!",
  "str_voice_1601561_34": "Ah, so you're not an idiot then.",
  "str_voice_1601561_35": "Ready!",
  "str_voice_1601561_36": "How much longer do I need to wait?",
  "str_voice_1601561_37": "What a fool!",
  "str_voice_1601561_38": "Let me show you my collection then.",
  "str_voice_1601561_39": "So noisy!",
  "str_voice_1601561_4": "Huh? You think my combat has improved? Naturally! Watch out, I shall dominate Umbraton soon!",
  "str_voice_1601561_40": "You... nincompoops!",
  "str_voice_1601561_41": "Everybody, follow my lead!",
  "str_voice_1601561_42": "Victory is inevitable with me at the helm.",
  "str_voice_1601561_43": "No one can defeat me!",
  "str_voice_1601561_44": "Please tell me there is a place for afternoon tea here.",
  "str_voice_1601561_45": "Eh, is this the sort of thing that commoners fancy?",
  "str_voice_1601561_46": "This, huh... It's alright, I suppose.",
  "str_voice_1601561_47": "Don't get cocky, I didn't say I liked it!",
  "str_voice_1601561_48": "So you do know what I like... T-Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1601561_49": "Don't look down on me, I'm a Lumopolis heiress, you know. Why don't I live in Lumopolis? That's... a long story.",
  "str_voice_1601561_5": "Wahahaha, weapon design inspiration is just pouring in! Told you, I'm a genius in this field!",
  "str_voice_1601561_50": "I don't understand why everyone praises Bethel so much and thinks of her as Umbraton's successor... I'm a top student at Dawn Academy too!",
  "str_voice_1601561_51": "Papa's a dummy! I always thought he'd understand me most, but it turns out he has no idea what it is I want... Never mind, I'll obtain what I want on my own!",

  "str_voice_1601561_56": "Good evening.",
  "str_voice_1601561_57": "Happy New Year! May the new year fulfill all our wishes. Mine is... a secret!",
  "str_voice_1601561_6": "I'm already a professional in costume design, gem appraising, and weapons manufacturing. I shall conquer another field now! Which one should I choose... Ah, right, Caelestite study!",
  "str_voice_1601561_7": "As you know, I'm a pretty famous fashion designer. I'm not opposed to designing an outfit for you, you know. Friendly reminder, you should say \"It's my honor\" in this kind of situation!",

  "str_voice_1601581_10": "All right, let's get it started.",
  "str_voice_1601581_11": "Roger that. I got this.",
  "str_voice_1601581_12": "To me, it doesn't matter where I live. There's never much of a difference.. Hmmm, think of it as abiding by local customs.",
  "str_voice_1601581_13": "Ready?",
  "str_voice_1601581_14": "The decision is up to you.",
  "str_voice_1601581_15": "Happy birthday.",

  "str_voice_1601721_13": "You know what's delicious and fills you up like nothing else? Popcorn. I was totally broke when I came to Umbraton. I often ate other people's leftover popcorn buckets at the cinema to stave off hunger.",

  "str_voice_1601721_47": "You sure know how to please a lady!",
  "str_voice_1601721_48": "I won't forget you when I become rich in the future.",
  "str_voice_1601721_49": "Seafood was so expensive growing up. My parents could only afford it on my birthday. Once I get paid for this role, I'm going to treat them to a grand seafood banquet in Umbraton!",
  "str_voice_1601721_5": "Let's take a photo together! Oh, you look a bit stiff. Taking a photo with a future celebrity is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, you know. Let's try that smile again!",
  "str_voice_1601721_50": "This is the camera my parents gave me when I was little. I know it's old, but there's something wonderful about the vintage textures it captures. I love using it to photograph everyday things. Pity film rolls are expensive.",

  "str_voice_1601721_6": "You've got to keep investing in yourself in this business. You can't cut corners when it comes to your face. Smart people know what I'm talking about!",
  "str_voice_1601721_7": "I can't believe it's taken me this long to realize I could also make a great director. I can't wait to direct a movie starring myself!",
  "str_voice_1601721_8": "Wanna go watch a movie together? I'm thinking horror. Don't worry, I've seen it all. I'll tell you in advance if something scary's about to happen.",

  "str_voice_1601731_1": "I was just wondering what you prefer in terms of flowers? I got some tips from a merchant from Cloud Island, and if you don't mind, I'd like to redecorate the dining table with some freshly-plucked flowers.",

  "str_voice_1601731_16": "I understand you're busy, but I must remind you of the importance of regular mealtimes. Take care of yourself.",
  "str_voice_1601731_17": "Would you care to try the blueberry and raspberry cheesecake or the vanilla souffle for early morning tea?",
  "str_voice_1601731_18": "Might I recommend a bath, seeing as you're rather tired? I've already taken the liberty of running the hot water.",
  "str_voice_1601731_19": "The importance of proper rest cannot be overstated. You may find yourself doubly as productive in the daylight hours if you look after your needs now.",

  "str_voice_1601731_24": "Miss Nina's heart is pure and kind, and I shall guard her life with mine.",
  "str_voice_1601731_25": "Although Sanae's lack of coordination may sometimes be a cause for concern, Miss Nina really likes her.",
  "str_voice_1601731_26": "Is there anything more exhilarating than the sense of everything being neat, tidy, and in proper order?",
  "str_voice_1601731_27": "How can some people tolerate such messes in their rooms? I simply cannot understand.",
  "str_voice_1601731_28": "The Colossus has truly been arrayed in a stately fashion. Except with the constant crowd coming and going, it really need to be cleaned regularly.",
  "str_voice_1601731_29": "It's an honor to meet you. I'm Minos, and although I will remain the Andersen family's exclusive butler, be assured I'll do my very best to help you.",
  "str_voice_1601731_3": "I'm no mind reader. I simply anticipate what my masters and their guests will need, then make meticulous arrangements for them. This is a basic requirement of a butler who serves the Andersen family.",

  "str_voice_1601731_31": "I still have so far to go.",

  "str_voice_1601731_35": "I await your command.",

  "str_voice_1601731_37": "Let's finish this quickly.",
  "str_voice_1601731_38": "Fear not. I will lull you to sleep using the most gentle of methods.",
  "str_voice_1601731_39": "Time to disappear.",
  "str_voice_1601731_4": "It's so much quieter now that I got rid of those nearby Eclipsites. How do you feel about accompanying me on a leisurely stroll?",
  "str_voice_1601731_40": "Filthy.",
  "str_voice_1601731_41": "Rest assured, leave the task to me.",
  "str_voice_1601731_42": "Good thing I didn't dirty my clothing.",
  "str_voice_1601731_43": "I'm sorry. I greatly miscalculated.",
  "str_voice_1601731_44": "I thoroughly cleaned the drinking glasses at the bar, so you don't have to worry about using them.",

  "str_voice_1601731_49": "The horn on my head did not break off by itself, but as a result of my mentor's... Never mind. It's in the past. Let bygones remain bygones. Would you care to refresh yourself with a mint and lime tea?",
  "str_voice_1601731_5": "A strict schedule is absolutely essential. Lost time cannot be gotten back, so calibrating my pocket watch is one of the very first things I do in the morning.",
  "str_voice_1601731_50": "One must always take great care of one's appearance. I remember how I once failed to entirely remove some blood stains off myself and gave Miss Nina such a scare that she refused to come near me for a very long time. It really broke my heart.",
  "str_voice_1601731_51": "There really isn't all that much to being a butler—apart from ironing, cleaning, making meals, entertaining guests; eliminating nearby Eclipsites, potential assailants, nosy troublemakers; as well as the occasional act of intimidation against harbingers of ill-intent.",

  "str_voice_1601731_6": "One's control over a situation—whether on the battlefield or in a business—is largely dependent on experience. You have genuine talent. I'd be happy to share what I've learned.",
  "str_voice_1601731_7": "Just a moment, you have a tear in your clothes... It may not seem like much, but we can only take care of great things when we take care of the little things first. I'll have it sewn up in no time.",
  "str_voice_1601731_8": "I decided to cook a meal as I had a free moment. Does it suit your palate? Oh, there's a spot of butter at the corner of your mouth. Let me wipe it off.",
  "str_voice_1601731_9": "A gentleman must know how to dance, and I expect as much from a friend of Nina's. Well? What are you waiting for? Here. Hands on my waist. Let's begin.",
  "str_voice_1601751_1": "I see you're staring, PlayerName. They don't hurt. These bandages and prosthetics are necessary equipment for a combat cyborg and not the result of being wounded in battle.",
  "str_voice_1601751_10": "Phew... I understand. My job now is to regain my strength.",
  "str_voice_1601751_11": "Please enjoy working on your current task, PlayerName. You can leave urgent matters like special training and shift duty to me.",
  "str_voice_1601751_12": "I detect that you are currently taking a break. Please join me in the simulator for training so that we can experience the thrill of battle.",
  "str_voice_1601751_13": "You say you wish to teach my Cubes how to play music? But I don't believe we can find the right equipment to do so in Illumina... Pardon? You want to use the control panel on the Colossus to teach them? I see.",
  "str_voice_1601751_14": "I am easily exhausted, but a brief rest in my stasis chamber is all I need to regain my strength. Just give me a bit more time, please.",
  "str_voice_1601751_15": "Happy birthday, PlayerName.",
  "str_voice_1601751_16": "Thank goodness you're still alive and in good health... Hmm? Did something I say disturb you?",
  "str_voice_1601751_17": "The scent of rain hangs in the air, and seven Fireflies just flew by... What I mean is, good morning.",
  "str_voice_1601751_18": "Have you noticed something unique about my skin? When the sun goes down, my entire body begins to glow with a faint light.",
  "str_voice_1601751_19": "Can't sleep? You're welcome to try sleeping in my stasis chamber... But I don't think both of us will fit inside.",
  "str_voice_1601751_2": "The sensation of pop rocks crackling in my mouth is quite exhilarating. I presume this is what you mean when you talk about \"feelings,\" PlayerName.",
  "str_voice_1601751_20": "I am a child of the whole of Illumina. To serve Illumina is my purpose.",
  "str_voice_1601751_21": "A city floating in the sky? That sounds somewhat different from what Sean's terminal describes. You'll have to take me there so I can verify it.",
  "str_voice_1601751_22": "Splendor Illumina.",
  "str_voice_1601751_23": "Fighting Eclipsites is just a routine process, since the outcome is always the same.",
  "str_voice_1601751_24": "Yingel's personality is not unlike my father's, but I know that Yingel is capable of feeling a plethora of emotions.",
  "str_voice_1601751_25": "Sean is different than me. Perhaps being stationed in a war zone will bring out his full power?",
  "str_voice_1601751_26": "Please give me more pop rocks as my reward for achieving victory.",
  "str_voice_1601751_27": "Sorry, it's harder for me to lift my spirits when it's raining. My legs feel so much heavier.",
  "str_voice_1601751_28": "You spent seventeen years sleeping in here? I see... So the Colossus is actually just an enormous stasis chamber.",
  "str_voice_1601751_29": "Combat Cyborg Axelia, reporting for duty. If fighting is your last remaining option, allow me to serve as your most powerful weapon.",
  "str_voice_1601751_3": "The only enemy I can never defeat is this overwhelming drowsiness... But like Yingel always says, \"Fight hard, rest hard.\" Yawn...",
  "str_voice_1601751_30": "I completely understand now.",
  "str_voice_1601751_31": "Simple training, nothing more.",
  "str_voice_1601751_32": "With practice comes power.",
  "str_voice_1601751_33": "Please test my strength in real combat.",
  "str_voice_1601751_34": "As you command.",
  "str_voice_1601751_35": "Axelia, on standby.",
  "str_voice_1601751_36": "Three... Two... One...",
  "str_voice_1601751_37": "Sorry for the delay.",
  "str_voice_1601751_38": "Leave it to me.",
  "str_voice_1601751_39": "I'll protect everyone.",
  "str_voice_1601751_4": "My leg joints may creak as though they need oil, but once I infuse them with my Luminatics, I can leap across huge distances as though they were powerful springs.",
  "str_voice_1601751_40": "It's not over yet.",
  "str_voice_1601751_41": "Just like in training.",
  "str_voice_1601751_42": "Victory was the only possible outcome.",
  "str_voice_1601751_43": "*Coughs* An unprecedented experience...",
  "str_voice_1601751_44": "Beginning sentry duty... No danger detected in the area.",
  "str_voice_1601751_45": "Please set it down over there.",
  "str_voice_1601751_46": "Is this how one establishes good relations?",
  "str_voice_1601751_47": "Put this away nicely, Cubes.",
  "str_voice_1601751_48": "I'll take good care of this.",
  "str_voice_1601751_49": "It was the Phospherus Program that gave me my understanding of the world. As for my \"real parents\"... Sorry, but I have no memory files on them.",
  "str_voice_1601751_5": "The Cubes are just as important to me as the Fireflies are to you, PlayerName. Do you understand?",
  "str_voice_1601751_50": "When my skin tore apart, I experienced death in its truest form. In my opinion, the ones who give me life are my parents, regardless of how many times I've been reborn.",
  "str_voice_1601751_51": "The Cubes were given to me by Algol as a gift. Not only do they help me in my everyday life, they also assist me in battle.",

  "str_voice_1601751_6": "The one with clock gears on its back is \"01,\" the one with wings is \"10,\" and the one with a halo around its head is \"11.\" It's actually quite easy to tell the Cubes apart, don't you think?",
  "str_voice_1601751_7": "I understand that training must be cruel sometimes, as disqualification and even death are inevitable results of defeat. But these things will never happen as long as I am on the battlefield.",
  "str_voice_1601751_8": "Hello, PlayerName... It appears you didn't hear me. In that case... CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?",
  "str_voice_1601751_9": "Can you help me take a look at something? It appears my bandages have gotten caught in my leg joints...",
  "str_voice_1601771_1": "Hm, are you staring at me? Hah, allow me to show you what a real idol looks like! *cough* Wait a minute, I need to drink a little cough medicine first to protect my throat.",
  "str_voice_1601771_10": "I see... So, this is what loneliness feels like. I rarely find myself in such a state. But it's interesting to experience such overwhelming silence in person once in a while.",
  "str_voice_1601771_11": "Even if I stand here alone... Even if I stand here all alone, I'll still shout to all before me—I like this world! I like everyone! I... I like myself, because I can bring happiness and joy to everyone!",
  "str_voice_1601771_12": "Did you notice the bullet in my hair? Sure, the design is pretty out there, but it helps me a lot. Every time I throw it out, it falls to the ground facing the right direction. I think it's telling me that we should also face life positively every day.",
  "str_voice_1601771_13": "It's wonderful being on the stage with so many people watching me! They give me so much courage and strength, just like... just like my special little companion!",
  "str_voice_1601771_14": "Marshmallow! Oh Marshmallow! Huh? No, I don't want to eat marshmallows! Marshmallow is the name of this little white doggy beside me! Hehe, it looks exactly like the dog from the adverts I liked when I was a kid!",
  "str_voice_1601771_15": "I hope you have a happy birthday... but I also hope you're happy every day!",
  "str_voice_1601771_16": "Hi hi! Will you come to my show tonight? Yup! Consider this an official invitation!",
  "str_voice_1601771_17": "Good morning! I've already started my voice training for the day! I hope I can spread good cheer to everyone with a wonderful song!",
  "str_voice_1601771_18": "I'm a little tired right now... but everyone's shouting \"encore,\" so... I can keep going!",
  "str_voice_1601771_19": "Let me tell you a secret... The reason I always go out at night is because I... I want to be a hero the children can look up to!",
  "str_voice_1601771_2": "Guess how long it takes for me to look this fabulous every day. Half an hour? Are you kidding!? Half an hour is just barely enough for me to do my hair!",
  "str_voice_1601771_20": "Most of my events occur in Umbraton, so sometimes I like going to other places to let more people hear me perform live.",
  "str_voice_1601771_21": "Lumopolis? Musicians there and idols are like two different species! Totally!",
  "str_voice_1601771_22": "Dazzling songs and colors are watching over you!",
  "str_voice_1601771_23": "Anyone who doesn't appreciate beauty and only knows how to destroy things will have me to answer to!",
  "str_voice_1601771_24": "Brandy is a very dedicated and professional girl!",
  "str_voice_1601771_25": "Lady Sheol is really smart! I always feel like I can learn lots of different things from the way she thinks about things.",
  "str_voice_1601771_26": "Huh? My badges? Heheh, they're all the awards I've won.",
  "str_voice_1601771_27": "It's time to weigh myself after eating bitter melon for a whole week... Ah! My weight hasn't changed a bit!",
  "str_voice_1601771_28": "Hmm, I know. Soroz is like your Marshmallow, right?",
  "str_voice_1601771_29": "Hey! I'm Goldie! You're PlayerName, right? I'm glad to meet you in this glittering, gorgeous, and gentle world!",
  "str_voice_1601771_3": "We really do have a similar sense of style! I think my customized microphone is very unique too! Wanna try it? Oh, but it's pure gold... Can you even lift it?",
  "str_voice_1601771_30": "Wow! Amazing!",
  "str_voice_1601771_31": "I feel like I'm about to fly!",
  "str_voice_1601771_32": "La-la-la!",
  "str_voice_1601771_33": "Now I'm even more fabulous!",
  "str_voice_1601771_34": "I understand!",
  "str_voice_1601771_35": "Preparations complete!",
  "str_voice_1601771_36": "Good to go!",
  "str_voice_1601771_37": "My voice is full of energy!",
  "str_voice_1601771_38": "The highest notes!",
  "str_voice_1601771_39": "Blossom!",
  "str_voice_1601771_4": "Ah-ah-ah! Oooh, oooh! How interesting. I think my vocal range has increased with your help, PlayerName!",
  "str_voice_1601771_40": "Shine!",
  "str_voice_1601771_41": "Give it your all!",
  "str_voice_1601771_42": "I'm so happy!",
  "str_voice_1601771_43": "Don't... Don't be discouraged!",
  "str_voice_1601771_44": "No matter where I am, I can create new dreams!",
  "str_voice_1601771_45": "What... I'm so happy!",
  "str_voice_1601771_46": "I'll repay you with a special performance!",
  "str_voice_1601771_47": "This feeling of gratitude... It's overwhelming!",
  "str_voice_1601771_48": "A gift from you... I'll treasure it all my life!",
  "str_voice_1601771_49": "I was born into a very ordinary family. When I was young, I thought all the stars I saw on TV were in another world... and the marshmallow dog in that advert too.",
  "str_voice_1601771_5": "My footsteps feel lighter, like they've become one with the music. It's such a beautiful and harmonious sensation! PlayerName, would you like to dance with me?",
  "str_voice_1601771_50": "That day I was taken hostage? It wasn't all bad... I became a little claustrophobic after that, but I also acquired such wonderful abilities.",
  "str_voice_1601771_51": "Heehee! Do you like seeing me on stage? Thank you so much! I like the person I am on stage, but I like the person I am off stage too.",
  "str_voice_1601771_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1601771_53": "Hi!",
  "str_voice_1601771_54": "Good morning! What are you doing?",
  "str_voice_1601771_55": "Good afternoon! Remember to keep yourself hydrated!",
  "str_voice_1601771_56": "If you want to keep your voice in tip-top condition, remember to sleep early!",
  "str_voice_1601771_57": "Happy New Year! I should be able to learn more dance steps this year, right?",
  "str_voice_1601771_6": "This feeling... Yes! Thank you, PlayerName! My night performances will go a lot smoother now!",
  "str_voice_1601771_7": "Let me tell you a secret! If someone points a gun at you, as long as you count silently in your heart and skip all the sevens, the bullet will never hit you! It's true!",
  "str_voice_1601771_8": "There are bows on the heels of my shoes, a bow adorning the front of my clothing, and bows along the hem of my skirt... I... I just really like bows! Do you like them too, PlayerName?",
  "str_voice_1601771_9": "If you want to... Oh, no! I mean... if you're free, you can check out the top of my hair. It's a heart shape!",
  "str_voice_1601771_99": "I hope my singing gives everyone inspiration and strength!",
  "str_voice_1601774_1": "Heheh... Oh, nothing. I just feel happy whenever you're around me!",
  "str_voice_1601774_10": "Twinkle, twinkle, you're the brightest star there is!",
  "str_voice_1601774_11": "Here comes Goldie! Did you miss me, Manager?",
  "str_voice_1601774_12": "Wanna play house? I'll be the mom, and you'll be the dad. Throw Marshmallow into the mix and—tada! We're a family of three!",
  "str_voice_1601774_13": "Wait, don't move... Mmkay, height, size... Can I make a life-sized pillow of you? Then I'll always feel warm and cozy!",
  "str_voice_1601774_14": "After wearing costumes for so long, it's nice to slip into soft, fluffy pajamas sometimes—especially when you're doing it with me!",
  "str_voice_1601774_16": "Ready to start today's work, PlayerName? Oops, I should call you \"Manager\" for today!",
  "str_voice_1601774_17": "*yawns* Morning, don't you wanna snooze with me some more?",
  "str_voice_1601774_18": "You've been working very hard. Come, I've got a reward for you!",
  "str_voice_1601774_19": "The day's over already? Then let's have sweet dreams together.",
  "str_voice_1601774_2": "Manager, Manager, Manager! You'd better get used to hearing that!",
  "str_voice_1601774_3": "You know, I'm terrified of the dark sometimes, but with you around, I don't fear anything.",
  "str_voice_1601774_35": "Let the concert begin!",
  "str_voice_1601774_36": "Hello, dream friends!",
  "str_voice_1601774_37": "Let me see your hands!",
  "str_voice_1601774_38": "Sing with me!",
  "str_voice_1601774_39": "Oh––Yay!",
  "str_voice_1601774_40": "I shall destroy you on behalf of the dream!",
  "str_voice_1601774_44": "I'd like to host a pajama concert here. Is that okay, Manager?",
  "str_voice_1601774_58": "Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do!",
  "str_voice_1601774_59": "Morning, Manager!",
  "str_voice_1601774_60": "You're going to be late if you don't get up now, Manager!",
  "str_voice_1601774_61": "Morning! Every day is a clean slate!",
  "str_voice_1601774_62": "Want me to sing you a lullaby?",
  "str_voice_1601774_63": "Was I a star on stage today?",
  "str_voice_1601774_64": "Marshmallow wants to sleep next to you.",
  "str_voice_1601774_65": "Good night, Manager!",
  "str_voice_1601774_66": "The pajamas make me unconsciously sleepy...",
  "str_voice_1601774_67": "Haha, what did you think of my dancing?",
  "str_voice_1601774_68": "Even at home in pajamas, you can't slack off!",
  "str_voice_1601774_69": "Where are you, Marshmallow?",
  "str_voice_1601774_70": "*coughs* Manager, my throat...",
  "str_voice_1601774_71": "What's your opinion on my new songs?",
  "str_voice_1601781_1": "*Yawn* Where's Fia? Where's my cute little apprentice? I need a shoulder massage! I guess sleeping on my stomach was not good for my neck and shoulders... Ow, ow, ow...",
  "str_voice_1601781_10": "Sleepy? Come lay down with me on Little Furball. It won't mind.",
  "str_voice_1601781_11": "I just have to sit here and keep watch, right? I'll brush these little ones in the meantime.",
  "str_voice_1601781_12": "Ah-choo! I've been sneezing a lot recently. Perhaps some young lady is out there missing me?",
  "str_voice_1601781_13": "With a face like mine, idols would be out of work if I could sing, dance or act! They should thank me for becoming a hermit.",
  "str_voice_1601781_14": "Strength of character? That's something for you young people to ponder. For old folks like me, facing reality is how we survive.",
  "str_voice_1601781_15": "You don't like my gift? It's a baby tooth from a Peko Rabbit! It's super rare!",
  "str_voice_1601781_16": "Hey you, have you seen my manuscript? I hope none of the little ones ate it...",
  "str_voice_1601781_17": "You're up early. Must be nice to be so young and full of vitality.",
  "str_voice_1601781_18": "I'm hungry... Have you seen Fia? Why isn't my apprentice here with my meal yet?",
  "str_voice_1601781_19": "Come, let me take you out and show you some of the world's nocturnal wondrous beasts.",
  "str_voice_1601781_2": "Sorry about that, PlayerName. Wondrous beasts shed often, I hope you're not allergic or anything. I'll get Fia to clean it up. What? You'll do it? That's so nice of you! You can start with shoveling excrement from the sand...",
  "str_voice_1601781_20": "Extrozoologists are a weird bunch, but we all love animals.",
  "str_voice_1601781_21": "A smart ruler knows how important the environment and ecology are to development.",
  "str_voice_1601781_22": "My duty is to find wondrous beasts and learn their secrets.",
  "str_voice_1601781_23": "Eclipsites are ugly and boring, so I'm not interested in them.",
  "str_voice_1601781_24": "It makes me sad to be misunderstood by my favorite apprentice, who calls me a liar every day... *Sob*",
  "str_voice_1601781_25": "Shira is a strong child. She'll take up the mantle to protect the wondrous beasts!",
  "str_voice_1601781_26": "Alcohol inspires both literature and art. A few drinks always helps get the creative juices flowing!",
  "str_voice_1601781_27": "Ahhhh! Who moved my books?! They're out of order!",
  "str_voice_1601781_28": "Can I borrow a greenhouse? Some wondrous beasts need a warmer environment to survive.",
  "str_voice_1601781_29": "Understanding wondrous beasts is one of the many ways to learn about this world. Want to see some incredible sights of creatures you've never seen before?",
  "str_voice_1601781_3": "It's rude to ask anyone's age, so all you need to remember is that I'm forever eighteen. But you can ask me about other things, like which wondrous beast's secretion is best for your skin.",
  "str_voice_1601781_30": "I think these little creatures have taken to you.",
  "str_voice_1601781_31": "Don't get me involved in anything complicated!",

  "str_voice_1601781_39": "I'm tired.",
  "str_voice_1601781_4": "I specially made this toy from the fallen plumage of a Lutumi Owl in accordance with wondrous beast taste. Little Furball loves it! How dare Fia call me stingy for being frugal?",
  "str_voice_1601781_40": "Why is this not over yet?",
  "str_voice_1601781_41": "Have mercy, please.",
  "str_voice_1601781_42": "I'm just as good as I used to be...",
  "str_voice_1601781_43": "I surrender!",
  "str_voice_1601781_44": "Do you need the Lutumi Owl to put you to sleep? If you suffer from chronic insomnia, extended sleep hypnosis services are available too.",

  "str_voice_1601781_49": "I got into wondrous beasts when I was young, but because of my family business, I've done things in the past that have harmed them. My scar and one remaining wing are the price I paid for those transgressions.",
  "str_voice_1601781_5": "I understand that people have different ideas and attitudes toward wondrous beasts, but I hope my books can make more people fall in love with these little creatures and understand their ways.",
  "str_voice_1601781_50": "Wondrous beasts are simple, innocent creatures without the deceptiveness Aurorians are prone to. I saved Little Furball, and it decided to travel with me as I roamed Astra, protecting me along the way. Unlike those two apprentices that yell at me and bully me all day... sigh.",
  "str_voice_1601781_51": "It's not that I don't trust you. It's just that I don't even know that much about my bloodline. I've only read about Ouroboros in ancient tomes, and I'm still trying to figure out how I'm connected to it. If you're so interested in me, want to help me look for leads?",
  "str_voice_1601781_52": "Alchemy Stars.",

  "str_voice_1601781_8": "If you also like wondrous beasts, do you wanna travel through Astra with me next time? I'll credit you as an assistant in my book. Don't worry, it's not as if I'm hoping for free labor or transportation or anything like that...",
  "str_voice_1601781_9": "One of your kin, a girl, once helped me learn how to communicate with wondrous beasts. Sometimes you remind me of her... I wonder if the two of you are related?",
  "str_voice_1601781_99": "I practiced the tambourine for a long time so I could get good at it. I hope I don't let everyone down!",
  "str_voice_1601811_1": "I've gone to sea with the Lin Guildmaster several times. It's very beautiful out there on the waves. You can just put your thoughts to one side and enjoy the sights with all your heart.",

  "str_voice_1601821_48": "Thank you very much. This is very agreeable to me.",
  "str_voice_1601821_49": "I was born with a serpentfish tail. Most people feel afraid when they see it. Oh? You don't fear it, but are merely curious?",
  "str_voice_1601821_5": "I didn't know you had such a strong constitution. It's impressive that you didn't get seasick and vomit in a storm as violent as the one we encountered just now. I'll take you to the boat race tomorrow, that should be even more exciting. Hmm? Why are you running away?",
  "str_voice_1601821_50": "This Ancestral Bone Dagger was given to me by the elder of the Lin Family twice—once when I was born and once when my father left.",

  "str_voice_1601821_7": "When you're free, I'll take you out to sea to hunt a legendary horned whale. You want to go now? No, I must send a boat out to scout things out in advance. I'll call upon you once I've made arrangements.",

  "str_voice_1601821_9": "I look out-of-sorts? It's probably because I just reprimanded several of my subordinates, the fools. Don't go. You're not one of my subordinates! Don't mind me, just... stand there. By my side.",
  "str_voice_1601841_1": "Another one of the kids is looking for me? Whatever they want, tell them they're on their own. Don't worry, I trust them. It's not such a big deal, no need to stress!",

  "str_voice_1601841_12": "I don't look like I'm from the Rediesel Wrench? I agree with you there. I haven't found a faction yet that truly suits me. And I like it that way.",
  "str_voice_1601841_13": "I have a sharp tongue sometimes? Hmm... Who knows? Sharp or soft, my voice only repeats itself when there's an echo in the room. Listener beware...",
  "str_voice_1601841_14": "Relationships... I don't really care for them. But I feel a little sad when I come across letters with no recipient that can only be thrown away.",

  "str_voice_1601841_2": "... Huh? What was that? I was lost in this book and didn't hear you. Go ahead, I'll listen to you while reading. Uh-huh... Yep... I promise I'm listening.",
  "str_voice_1601841_20": "Compared with the other factions, the Courier Union is really quite a cozy place.",
  "str_voice_1601841_21": "Sometimes, I really wish people from the Rediesel Wrench would think before acting.",
  "str_voice_1601841_22": "The Courier Union, always delivers... most of the time.",
  "str_voice_1601841_23": "Eclipsites... Where do they come from, and what is their purpose?",
  "str_voice_1601841_24": "Kya is a simple and lovely little girl. I like her a lot! And she's really good at her job.",
  "str_voice_1601841_25": "Don't worry. If the sky were to fall tomorrow, as long as Naroxel's still standing, we'll be fine.",
  "str_voice_1601841_26": "I love reading while munching on tasty liver snacks.",
  "str_voice_1601841_27": "Don't waste your life doing boring work. If you do, you'll end up becoming boring yourself.",
  "str_voice_1601841_28": "This Colossus is different from the one in the Rediesel Wrench. Caelestite culture really is beautifully profound...",
  "str_voice_1601841_29": "I'm Jeriah. You can cut the formalities with me. You're concerned about my two companions? Don't be afraid—like me, they like exploring new things more than fighting.",
  "str_voice_1601841_3": "So, you prepared all these resources here for us to use for free? You're such a great person, little Caelestite... Or perhaps I should instead say that we all love taking advantage of you too much.",
  "str_voice_1601841_30": "Mmm, this feels great.",
  "str_voice_1601841_31": "I seem to have gotten stronger.",

  "str_voice_1601841_49": "I was born in the Rediesel Wrench, and my parents are... very liberal people. I'm grateful for their continued tolerance despite the fact that my personality is so contrary.",
  "str_voice_1601841_5": "I went to Eraveil once before you started rebuilding it. Confusion, desolation, dead silence... destruction. It makes me wonder—what's the point of progress?",

  "str_voice_1601841_6": "Sacred Python has been imbuing me with a peculiar feeling recently. How can I explain it...? Hmm. Let me be uncharacteristically serious for once. It's the feeling that our journey here has not been for nothing.",
  "str_voice_1601841_7": "I appreciate your neutral attitude and that you don't favor any particular faction's ideology. Chaos, class, despotism, conservatism... There's no need to pigeonhole yourself rashly.",
  "str_voice_1601841_8": "You don't always need to take an active part in the drama all around you. Try sitting back and enjoying the fun of watching it unfold with me. You have no idea how amusing the drama of life can be. I know you'd definitely love it.",
  "str_voice_1601841_9": "Come, tell me what you've seen and heard recently. You haven't done anything lately? Life has been boring? Don't say that. I like your little anecdotes.",
  "str_voice_1601861_1": "What a wonderful day! I'll go out for a stroll and have a nap when I come back. But this lounge chair is too comfortable. Hmm, I'll skip the stroll and go direct to napping.",

  "str_voice_1601861_12": "I love sweet foods, but can't sleep if I have too much. You too, be sure to watch your sugar intake. You don't want to end up being a super-sized Caelestite.",
  "str_voice_1601861_13": "Huh? Where's my notebook? I always record the time I wake up in it every day. It saves me so much trouble.",
  "str_voice_1601861_14": "My dreams never last very long, but I always remember them clearly. I'd write them down in my notebook if they're interesting enough.",

  "str_voice_1601911_29": "Don't let the way I look scare you. Don't push me away just because of my appearance. I'm just an ordinary Aurorian—my name's Hati. If it's alright with you, let's be friends.",
  "str_voice_1601911_3": "I was deliberately hiding in the corner at the party, mostly out of laziness—socializing is such a drag. But I could tell there was someone interested in you. Hadn't you noticed? Forget it, you'll feel it yourself, eventually.",

  "str_voice_1601991_41": "I'm very good at giving orders.",
  "str_voice_1601991_42": "It was all part of the plan.",
  "str_voice_1601991_43": "I'll need to draw up a new plan...",
  "str_voice_1601991_44": "I'll make sure Aoha flies carefully. I wouldn't want to cause trouble on your Colossus.",
  "str_voice_1601991_45": "Is this for me? Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1601991_46": "I really like it when you make a fuss over me.",
  "str_voice_1601991_47": "I see this as proof of your approval.",

  "str_voice_1601991_56": "Oh, it's evening already.",
  "str_voice_1601991_57": "Happy New Year! I hope I get to see you at this time next year too.",
  "str_voice_1601991_6": "You must focus your entire body when shooting. Be careful not to breathe, as it can affect your shot. Once you grasp this, you too can become a worthy sniper.",
  "str_voice_1601991_7": "You want to know if working for the Committee is monotonous and tedious? Many people think so, but strategizing has always been interesting to me.",
  "str_voice_1601991_8": "Sometimes I feel like Aoha is just like me. Its obedience and frailty are a facade; courage and determination beat within its tiny heart.",
  "str_voice_1601991_9": "Our pasts are very similar. As a relatively lonely individual with endless responsibilities, I understand how you feel. I'm willing to listen if you ever need someone to talk to.",
  "str_voice_1602011_1": "I... I haven't worn a dress of such color in a long time. Does it look good on me? Heheh, this is a little embarassing.",

  "str_voice_1602011_12": "Regardless of what others might say, I will always be Carleen's sister, as well as... Joshua's daughter. No humdrum honor can sever the family bond.",
  "str_voice_1602011_13": "I have... a friend, named Baba Yaga who used to be somewhat brutal, but not anymore. Please don't freak out if you get a chance to meet her, okay?",
  "str_voice_1602011_14": "I scraped my knee in training and it hurts... What? No, it's just a flesh wound! I have tears in my eyes? *sniffles* No, I don't...",
  "str_voice_1602011_15": "Happy birthday. It's a joy to be able to grow up.",
  "str_voice_1602011_16": "You should go out whenever you're free. The streets are pretty in the daytime.",
  "str_voice_1602011_17": "Good morning, and what a wonderful morning it is. Care for morning tea?",
  "str_voice_1602011_18": "It's getting dark... It's okay though, I'm used to the dark.",
  "str_voice_1602011_19": "Still busy this late at night? I guess it's the same for everyone with vital obligations.",
  "str_voice_1602011_2": "It's not necessary to take an opponent's life in battle, right? Yes, I understand only a great warrior has the privilege of choosing compassion, and I'm far from that...",
  "str_voice_1602011_20": "Even if I can only watch my home from afar, I'll still defend it with all my might.",
  "str_voice_1602011_21": "Umbraton is a nice place. People from Lumopolis should visit more often.",
  "str_voice_1602011_22": "White Night up high... Haha, that brings back memories.",
  "str_voice_1602011_23": "You hate Eclipsites? Then, what about Eclipsites-turned-Aurorians?",
  "str_voice_1602011_24": "Carleen and Mother... I wish we could always—no, never mind.",
  "str_voice_1602011_25": "The Schwartz name isn't important enough for me to keep living in his shadow.",
  "str_voice_1602011_26": "Enjoying a cup of Knight's Black Tea in a little cafe alone in the afternoon... is simply perfect.",
  "str_voice_1602011_27": "It's okay, I can handle a lot of things myself without troubling others...",
  "str_voice_1602011_28": "It's so crowded here... and there are people I want to see and those I don't.",
  "str_voice_1602011_29": "Hello. Let me see how should I introduce myself... Veronica? No, just call me Mia. Mia should do.",
  "str_voice_1602011_3": "Wow, the streets are so crowded. What are they doing? I'll prioritize finishing my tasks! But I hope the sun is still out when I'm done...",
  "str_voice_1602011_30": "Must keep training...",
  "str_voice_1602011_31": "I think I've mastered it!",
  "str_voice_1602011_32": "I'm a knight... I'm not weak!",
  "str_voice_1602011_33": "If only I had such power sooner...",
  "str_voice_1602011_34": "I'll keep doing my best...!",
  "str_voice_1602011_35": "I-I'm ready!",
  "str_voice_1602011_36": "Please don't be afraid...",
  "str_voice_1602011_37": "Meet my power!",
  "str_voice_1602011_38": "Meet my true self!",
  "str_voice_1602011_39": "Take this!",
  "str_voice_1602011_4": "When I was little, I'd feel dejected and helpless no matter how hard I tried... Now, I'm only fighting for my own goals, and it's a lot easier on my mind.",
  "str_voice_1602011_40": "Hold nothing back!",
  "str_voice_1602011_41": "Everyone... follow me!",
  "str_voice_1602011_42": "W-We won... We won!",
  "str_voice_1602011_43": "Sigh. Still not good enough...",
  "str_voice_1602011_44": "Greetings. How are you lately? Heheh, I haven't said that in a while.",
  "str_voice_1602011_45": "Thank you.",
  "str_voice_1602011_46": "Hey, what's this...",
  "str_voice_1602011_47": "What is it this time?",
  "str_voice_1602011_48": "Only you know me so well...",
  "str_voice_1602011_49": "\"Veronica,\" eldest daughter of the Lumopolis City Lord... and a blemish on House Schwartz. That's the history this dress represents.",
  "str_voice_1602011_5": "Titles are such marvelous things. They can shackle you or give you limitless power. But you mustn't fixate on them...",
  "str_voice_1602011_50": "\"Baba Yaga,\" the specter-like black spider. She didn't die but merged with Mia to become the me you see now.",
  "str_voice_1602011_51": "I'm still Mia... and can only be Mia. But that's not an alias anyone else gave me. It is a road I chose for myself.",
  "str_voice_1602011_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1602011_53": "Excuse me...",
  "str_voice_1602011_54": "The black tea smells so good...",
  "str_voice_1602011_55": "Good afternoon. I'm not intruding, am I...?",
  "str_voice_1602011_56": "Um, good evening...",
  "str_voice_1602011_57": "Happy New Year. Cherish it by spending time with loved ones.",
  "str_voice_1602011_6": "If I had been as courageous before as I am now... No, it's useless to ponder these things. What's important is to protect what you cherish now, right?",
  "str_voice_1602011_7": "I'm different than before. I don't feel incessantly inferior, nor unable to control myself... It's true! So, mind trusting me a little more?",
  "str_voice_1602011_8": "Please don't bail me out all the time. No, it's not troublesome. It's just... I think I should be protecting you.",
  "str_voice_1602011_9": "Let me tell you a secret: My hand sometimes trembles in combat. Mind lending me a little courage? Oh, your hands are really warm...",
  "str_voice_1602021_1": "It is raining. My eldest daughter loves the rain and the way the raindrops make violet flowers bounce up and down. ...She's difficult to understand.",
  "str_voice_1602021_10": "One cannot achieve anything significant with such casual, cavalier attitude. If I were as irresponsible as you, many an affair in Lumopolis would be a mess.",
  "str_voice_1602021_11": "Are my time and attention really warranted for such trivial matters?",
  "str_voice_1602021_12": "Despite still being very young, Carleen has shown a cleverness far beyond her age. While she may not realize it, as a father, I am proud of her.",
  "str_voice_1602021_13": "Attacking is, of course, more important than defending. A strong offense can overwhelm timid enemies and expose more vulnerabilities.",
  "str_voice_1602021_14": "Regrettably, all who coveted the throne met—or will meet—obliteration in the end without exceptions, as the glory of House Schwartz shall persist forever.",
  "str_voice_1602021_15": "Happy birthday. This blessing comes from both me and Lumopolis.",
  "str_voice_1602021_16": "There you are. Remember to patrol your territory more often.",
  "str_voice_1602021_17": "You are early enough to enjoy tea with me.",
  "str_voice_1602021_18": "Stretch your body and relax your mind to improve your productivity.",
  "str_voice_1602021_19": "This is usually when I review my agenda for tomorrow.",
  "str_voice_1602021_2": "As I look over the vast Lumopolis, I ask myself if I deserve to lead its people. I must keep motivating myself to govern this land that represents sanctity.",
  "str_voice_1602021_20": "Under my leadership, Lumopolis will embrace a more prosperous, brighter future.",
  "str_voice_1602021_21": "Without a doubt, stability and prosperity in Umbraton are beneficial to Lumopolis.",
  "str_voice_1602021_22": "White Night up high.",
  "str_voice_1602021_23": "Eclipsites are attacking everywhere in large numbers. A hidden mastermind is certainly behind the plot.",
  "str_voice_1602021_24": "It was Joshua who made me what I am, and not the fact that I chose her.",
  "str_voice_1602021_25": "As long as Veronica can be guided towards the right path, she will make a difference.",
  "str_voice_1602021_26": "All Aurorians ought to prefer sunlight. That is why I like sunny days.",
  "str_voice_1602021_27": "Granting so-called compassion to the enemy in a battle is equivalent to showing no mercy to yourself, is it not?",
  "str_voice_1602021_28": "Allow me to place history books on the Colossus to help you understand the history of Lumopolis.",
  "str_voice_1602021_29": "We Schwartzes respect everyone who exhibits wisdom and resourcefulness. Since you proved to be extraordinary, you have earned the right to speak with me.",
  "str_voice_1602021_3": "I am actually a good conversationalist, although not many have had the chance to speak with me. You, however, are one of the exceptions.",
  "str_voice_1602021_30": "Power comes with authority.",
  "str_voice_1602021_31": "Looking forward to the dawn.",
  "str_voice_1602021_32": "It is daybreak.",
  "str_voice_1602021_33": "Righteousness shall guide Lumopolis!",
  "str_voice_1602021_34": "Correct decision.",
  "str_voice_1602021_35": "Ready to go!",
  "str_voice_1602021_36": "What are you waiting for?",
  "str_voice_1602021_37": "Ephemeral nights and days without end!",

  "str_voice_1602021_39": "Light of White Night!",
  "str_voice_1602021_4": "The Eclipsites brought darkness, but dawn is imminent. We will crush them until none remains.",
  "str_voice_1602021_40": "A sovereign's slash!",
  "str_voice_1602021_41": "I will lead the march!",
  "str_voice_1602021_42": "Victory is certain and expected.",
  "str_voice_1602021_43": "I spare them this one time.",
  "str_voice_1602021_44": "Do not underestimate this small land, for everlasting light and futures will unfold here.",
  "str_voice_1602021_45": "Well, I will accept it.",
  "str_voice_1602021_46": "What would you like in return?",
  "str_voice_1602021_47": "I will cherish this.",
  "str_voice_1602021_48": "I own countless treasures, but this gift is unique.",
  "str_voice_1602021_49": "Joshua came from civilian roots, thus House Schwartz forbade our marriage. However, I decided she was the one and was willing to put forth any effort.",
  "str_voice_1602021_5": "The war is at its peak. The closer we are to victory, the less we can afford complacency.",
  "str_voice_1602021_50": "Becoming a father was more impactful to me than becoming a governor later. It was when I started to realize the true meaning of responsibility.",
  "str_voice_1602021_51": "The threat of Eclipsites destroyed the peace we once had. For Lumopolis, for the helpless people, for my family, I must march into battle.",
  "str_voice_1602021_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1602021_53": "How are you doing?",

  "str_voice_1602021_57": "Feel free to visit Lumopolis in the new year.",
  "str_voice_1602021_6": "Might is the quintessence of being a leader. I will apply that very might to lead everyone to victory in war.",
  "str_voice_1602021_7": "As a ruler, it is necessary to remain clear-headed in the chaos.",
  "str_voice_1602021_8": "I prefer reading historical texts. I am willing to spend a few hours of my spare time reading certain well-known classics.",
  "str_voice_1602021_9": "Some people think I am overly demanding of my children, but the future is a long road, thus it is worth it if that will help them avoid miscues.",
  "str_voice_1602041_1": "I'll miss Lumopolis' black tea, that's for sure. But who knows? Maybe I'll stumble upon another tea just as good elsewhere. Can't wait to see what's out there.",
  "str_voice_1602041_10": "Have a glass of honey water—it works such wonders for relieving fatigue that you really can't afford not to drink it. Good children should always listen to the wisdom of their elders.",
  "str_voice_1602041_11": "Although I'm no slouch when it comes to managing important things, with regard to this Colossus... Well, I don't have much experience yet. But since this is your request, as your elder, I will do my best.",
  "str_voice_1602041_12": "Even though the world may seem so destitute sometimes, there are always people trying to make it a better place, and I believe you are one of them.",
  "str_voice_1602041_13": "What a mother truly hopes for is to see her children leave the nest and fly to wider skies. You've done exactly that. I'm proud of you, and I know your mother would be too.",

  "str_voice_1602061_50": "I'm so sorry about everything you've been through, but sometimes I envy you for growing up alone and totally free.",
  "str_voice_1602061_51": "Instead of calling me an entrepreneur, I'd rather you use my preferred title—Dream Chaser. I want to make my mark on this world and achieve my dreams through my own hard work.",

  "str_voice_1602061_6": "How do I run such a large business? My business philosophy is very simple: if you're going to do something, do it right. There's no point in giving up on anything halfway.",

  "str_voice_1602061_8": "The weather today is just so fabulous! Why don't we go out and explore a little? We might find something new! I-I just saw you and thought I'd ask you to come out...",
  "str_voice_1602061_9": "Erm, did I just fall asleep? I was up reading a report last night... Ah! Is this coat yours? You put it on me last night? Hmmm—No, of course I'm not blushing!",
  "str_voice_1602071_1": "Come on, mate, you're too uptight! Life's short, so don't sweat the small stuff! Energy, passion, and gorgeous girls—that's what life is all about!",
  "str_voice_1602071_10": "What are you doing standing around here like some dimwit? No one's asked you out on a date? Well, that's a real shame. Wanna learn something about time management, just watch the master in action.",
  "str_voice_1602071_11": "I'm gonna need you to pay me an hourly salary. Yeah, 10,000 Nightium per hour, that's the price of friendship. Erm... it looks like your financial situation isn't in the best state, so I guess I'll do you a favor for now.",
  "str_voice_1602071_12": "Hey, don't you know it's rude to treat me like I'm your uncle or something?! Why don't you call me Big Cena? You think that sounds awful? Well, that makes me real sad, kid. Just call me Cena, then.",
  "str_voice_1602071_13": "A lot of the facilities at the resort were carefully designed by yours truly to ensure that each guest enjoys a unique and unforgettable experience...",

  "str_voice_1602071_15": "Happy birthday! I hope you become a responsible man of character in the new year.",
  "str_voice_1602071_16": "Why are you staring at me? Is my hair a mess? Maybe I should go find a hairdresser to take care of my do...",
  "str_voice_1602071_17": "I recommend you try eggs Benedict for breakfast. It's nutritious and delicious!",
  "str_voice_1602071_18": "The night is young! I need to hurry up and go on a date!",
  "str_voice_1602071_19": "Young people shouldn't work so hard! Let's have a night out together!",
  "str_voice_1602071_2": "Apart from being the home of fine cuisine, fancy restaurants are also the perfect place to meet the most charming older women. These two points alone make them places well worth hanging around, in my eyes.",

  "str_voice_1602071_21": "I spent a long time in Lumopolis and was taken care of by a lot of kind-hearted people there.",
  "str_voice_1602071_22": "Live life in the present moment.",
  "str_voice_1602071_23": "The Eclipsites might not be smart, but they're very strong.",
  "str_voice_1602071_24": "Sinsa isn't exactly a meticulous guy, but we still get along.",
  "str_voice_1602071_25": "You want to know what the deal is with me and Bopper? I guess you could say she's like a daughter to me, ha.",
  "str_voice_1602071_26": "I like to try new perfumes, although they can be hit and miss sometimes. But that's part of the fun.",
  "str_voice_1602071_27": "Guys who don't even make an effort to look good make me sick.",
  "str_voice_1602071_28": "Soroz and I are birds of a feather. After all, we can both fly.",

  "str_voice_1602071_41": "I can hardly wait.",

  "str_voice_1602071_50": "I lived in Lumopolis for years and gradually succumbed to the sway of its culture and rules of social etiquette. Perhaps that's why you think I look slightly different from your typical Rediesel Wrench monkeys.",
  "str_voice_1602071_51": "You wanna know why I came back here? I guess I just got bored after traveling almost the entire continent of Astra and was fed up with drifting along with the tide.",

  "str_voice_1602071_8": "Hmm... You smell like a sweaty little kid. Just take this bottle of perfume and give it a try. No need to thank me, really.",
  "str_voice_1602071_9": "I'm not qualified to be loved... nor am I capable of truly loving. People say I don't take life seriously... Of course, I agree completely with them.",

  "str_voice_1602091_10": "There are still many things I can't figure out, but I'm used to the troubles and crises that come with this position.",
  "str_voice_1602091_11": "You would like to talk to me? Well, this is no longer the old Commander Wrath standing before you, so I suggest you choose your words carefully.",
  "str_voice_1602091_12": "Don't worry about me. A mission of this difficulty only means they still have no idea what I'm capable of.",
  "str_voice_1602091_13": "The legion I lead is but the tip of the Illumina military iceberg. I will beat a decisive, convincing victory out of any cocky opponent.",
  "str_voice_1602091_14": "I don't think having a somber demeanor is a problem. If you led a big army, I'd imagine you would look even more serious.",

  "str_voice_1602091_18": "Why did I not see you out on the field today? You must train hard to get to my level.",
  "str_voice_1602091_19": "Rest? Sorry, now is not the time for that.",
  "str_voice_1602091_2": "Humbling yourself doesn't mean being subservient. Only I can subvert myself.",
  "str_voice_1602091_20": "I should have anticipated the hierarchy's thirst for power and ever-surging ambition.",
  "str_voice_1602091_21": "That floating city purely caters to old-fashioned nobility, which I never cared for.",
  "str_voice_1602091_22": "Splendor Illumina!",

  "str_voice_1602091_48": "Thanks! I didn't expect you to be this thoughtful.",
  "str_voice_1602091_49": "I never thought of ascending to the seat of Grand Marshal through such means. But considering merit alone, I definitely qualify!",
  "str_voice_1602091_5": "The change in Red Baron is not unexpected. It's a reminder to those with bad intentions that justice has nothing to do with form.",
  "str_voice_1602091_50": "I don't approve of how Reinhardt likes to sweep things under the rug. But given the circumstances, I believe personal ambition is irrelevant compared to Illumina's future.",

  "str_voice_1602181_51": "My dear, money flow is just like blood flow—efficient circulation pumps vitality into society. In other words, the Cloudrover Guild is the organ responsible for propelling the world into prosperity!",
  "str_voice_1602181_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1602181_53": "Greetings, my valued customer.",

  "str_voice_1602181_57": "Happy New Year, my dear. The Cloudrover Guild has added yet another year of business to its history, and so has our friendship.",
  "str_voice_1602181_6": "All that rummaging and scurrying, like a cute little mouse. Ah, you there... Have you ever owned a pet snake?",
  "str_voice_1602181_7": "I can see that you're confused and somewhat hesitant, my dear customer... I'll show you how to turn money into a beloved wonder that will remain with you forever...",
  "str_voice_1602181_8": "Hmm? Have you found what you're looking for? Me? Haha, what a mischievous customer... I'm not for sale!",
  "str_voice_1602181_9": "Partners, you say? Heheh, you're much more to me than that.",
  "str_voice_1602183_1": "Anything in life can be seen from different perspectives. Think about it, even if I end up making someone lose their job, they'll probably end up with a better one and a better boss too—namely, me.",
  "str_voice_1602183_10": "Phew... What a busy day! I could really murder a bath right now. I say, rubber ducky, ahoy! Here I come!",
  "str_voice_1602183_11": "Oh, dear, it's always a pleasure to meet with you. Tell me, is there anything else you'd like to learn about business today?",
  "str_voice_1602183_12": "A guild's leader is nothing less than the face it shows to the world! No matter what one might be contemplating within, one must always put on a good face for the public. So, my dear, give me your honest opinion—what do you think of the perfume I have on today?",
  "str_voice_1602183_13": "In business, it's essential to maintain a respectful demeanor. That being said, I won't hesitate to take action if anyone refuses to listen to reason.",
  "str_voice_1602183_14": "My business strategy isn't about squeezing out every last bit of profit I can—it's about making huge gains on small investments. I'm just like you, my dear—we both love creating miracles, and we're good at it.",
  "str_voice_1602183_16": "Hah, there you are, my dear! How about I get started on managing your estate, yes?",
  "str_voice_1602183_17": "Oh my, you're so early today—what an earnest little thing you are. Remember, dear, patience is a virtue. Good things come to those who wait.",
  "str_voice_1602183_18": "What perfect timing. It would be my pleasure to treat you to dinner. Do you think you'll have time?",
  "str_voice_1602183_19": "Staying up so late to greet little old me? Dear, I'm starting to question your motives.",
  "str_voice_1602183_2": "May I ask why you're staring, my dear? You mean, I look much younger now? My, what a smooth-talking young man you are... Why don't you come a little closer and see if I've really changed that much?",
  "str_voice_1602183_3": "You'll get to know me soon enough, dear, there's no rush. Trust me, just keep working hard by my side and you'll find out before you know it.",
  "str_voice_1602183_35": "Prepare to be acquired.",
  "str_voice_1602183_36": "Don't hesitate.",
  "str_voice_1602183_37": "Take this—my seal of disapproval!",
  "str_voice_1602183_38": "Now, sell me your soul!",
  "str_voice_1602183_39": "Time to branch out!",
  "str_voice_1602183_40": "A most pleasing acquisition!",
  "str_voice_1602183_44": "Dear, don't you think this place is starting to look more my style?",
  "str_voice_1602183_58": "The Cloudrover Guild is open for business.",
  "str_voice_1602183_59": "How would you like to see the world with me?",
  "str_voice_1602183_60": "Good morning, my dear!",
  "str_voice_1602183_61": "I left a gift on your work desk.",
  "str_voice_1602183_62": "Airships are nothing like Colossi—especially when the sun is out.",
  "str_voice_1602183_63": "Oh my... Won't you even invite me in to sit for a while?",
  "str_voice_1602183_64": "I saw you there, out on the deck, standing in the breeze. Is something troubling you?",
  "str_voice_1602183_65": "I bet you're just itching to give me a massage, aren't you, dear?",

  "str_voice_1602183_70": "Seize the moment—it may very well be the moment that changes your life.",
  "str_voice_1602183_71": "Opportunities are fleeting—that is why I grab every last one of them with both hands.",
  "str_voice_1602191_1": "You say my style of playing chess has changed? Forthright, risky, and aggressive... This has always been my style, though it has been buried in the shadows for many years now.",
  "str_voice_1602191_10": "Haha, getting lost in thought is well and good, but daydreaming isn't.",
  "str_voice_1602191_11": "Every scar on my body is an eye, and I will use each of them to help you keep watch over this world.",
  "str_voice_1602191_12": "Morality and change are two things that must be gained through struggle. You should know by now that this principle applies even to Eclipsite-free worlds.",
  "str_voice_1602191_13": "There are children in this world with extraordinary gifts who live in circumstances beyond their control. I don't want them to experience the same things I experienced in the past. If you were a few years younger, I would happily take you in as well. Though I suppose it's still not too late for that.",
  "str_voice_1602191_14": "Those who preserve order don't need to know about the dirty secrets behind the establishment of that order. Just keep pressing onward, and the shadows will watch over your distant travels.",
  "str_voice_1602191_15": "Make a wish, and I will help you realize it.",
  "str_voice_1602191_16": "Always think carefully before taking action, and... never show your hand too easily.",
  "str_voice_1602191_17": "Youngster, you should bask in the warmth of the morning sun every chance you get. After all, this is the purpose of my mission in the shadows.",
  "str_voice_1602191_18": "You aren't taking a break today? Do you wish to learn more about the chaotic events of the past?",
  "str_voice_1602191_19": "Nngh... You're still awake? Forgive me, these scars tend to make their existence clear around this time of night.",
  "str_voice_1602191_2": "Squandering all of one's passion is a common pitfall of youth, and I was no exception. Hiding one's true strength is a necessary strategy.",
  "str_voice_1602191_20": "I will bring even greater stability and order to Umbraton, no matter the cost.",
  "str_voice_1602191_21": "Perhaps the reason everyone sees Northland as a safe haven is because of its queen, who has inherited and preserved a pure and orderly rule.",
  "str_voice_1602191_22": "The shadow is always watching you.",
  "str_voice_1602191_23": "Fending off Eclipsites doesn't often require much thought. Trust me, it can be a good way to relieve stress.",
  "str_voice_1602191_24": "Bethel... She's nothing like me, which is why she can stand beyond the shadows. It's a good thing.",
  "str_voice_1602191_25": "Heh, Leona sometimes reminds me of myself when I was younger. Her inner conviction is even more powerful than my own.",
  "str_voice_1602191_26": "Nobody likes to lose, and I'm no different—whether in chess or life.",
  "str_voice_1602191_27": "When you truly become one with the shadows, you quickly find yourself to be far more tolerant than ever before.",
  "str_voice_1602191_28": "You should learn to create a hidden space for yourself aboard the Colossus, one which even I could never find.",
  "str_voice_1602191_29": "Hmm, I suppose I should congratulate you. Now you understand that a shadow is born in the depths of chaos, and can never be truly free from it.",
  "str_voice_1602191_3": "I am unwilling to see my scars as accolades. As new wounds heal over old ones, they've become my armor... Another part of who I truly am.",
  "str_voice_1602191_30": "The shadows have no limit.",
  "str_voice_1602191_31": "A fitting reward for the price paid.",
  "str_voice_1602191_32": "The shadows grow deeper.",
  "str_voice_1602191_33": "A shadow's promise is eternal.",
  "str_voice_1602191_34": "Time to get moving.",
  "str_voice_1602191_35": "My scars are burning.",

  "str_voice_1602191_42": "They should know what awaits them.",
  "str_voice_1602191_43": "Just more scars to add to my body.",
  "str_voice_1602191_44": "Hmm? With every visit to your Colossus, I notice new changes.",
  "str_voice_1602191_45": "Your tastes... hmm, are better than my own back then.",
  "str_voice_1602191_46": "You really know how to cater to others.",
  "str_voice_1602191_47": "I could fill a display case with all these gifts.",
  "str_voice_1602191_48": "You know me better than my associates.",
  "str_voice_1602191_49": "When Umbraton's old order still existed, a child with a demonic appearance could never hope for kind treatment, even in the darker parts of the city.",
  "str_voice_1602191_5": "The ability to instill terror in others is an impressive power to wield. There's no denying that my natural appearance has granted me many advantages.",
  "str_voice_1602191_50": "We all wear different masks. The Istvan you see before you is nothing more than the person I wish for you to see.",
  "str_voice_1602191_51": "You wish to restore order to chaos? Then you must first become a part of that chaos.",

  "str_voice_1602191_56": "Veiled by the night.",
  "str_voice_1602191_57": "Raise your glass, for even the shadows celebrate the coming of a new year.",
  "str_voice_1602191_6": "When a person's scars are revealed in broad daylight, their power rises to the surface under the gaze of others. A shadow... should never hide the truth from itself either.",
  "str_voice_1602191_7": "Do you like the suits and shoes you see in my wardrobe? Those charismatic clothes serve as the perfect disguise, allowing me to become a true shadow...",
  "str_voice_1602191_8": "I have many bottles of wine in my collection that are as old as you, if not older. It's still too soon for you to try them, but I'll be sure to open one for you when you come of age.",
  "str_voice_1602191_9": "Your chess-playing is similar to that of an old friend of mine. At the time, I wasn't able to save him... I refuse to let you suffer a similar fate.",
  "str_voice_1602211_1": "In order to ensure that I follow your type system's instructions correctly, I must ask questions. By meeting your expectations with my queries, I hope to improve the efficiency of our conversations.",

  "str_voice_1602211_12": "Imagine an age of technological supremacy. There, memory must be worth as much as recorded information. Knowledge is power, after all; the more knowledge you gain, the stronger you become.",
  "str_voice_1602211_13": "History isn't always fact, and cultures aren't formed from raw data. Even if that machine records enough information to gain a sort of \"omniscience,\" it doesn't mean that we will follow the path it predicts.",
  "str_voice_1602211_14": "In battle, rather than overemphasizing the rituals needed to activate Luminatics, we should instead research the nature of Lumina itself. In my program, activating Luminatics requires nothing more than a few lines of inconspicuous code.",

  "str_voice_1602291_50": "Thanks to video games, I met Gronru. I was so shocked when she complimented my intuition and reaction speed... Maybe I'm not just a clumsy dork after all?",

  "str_voice_1602301_21": "Oppressing the believers, yet wanting to learn The Truth from them at the same time is the greatest farce to The Truth.",

  "str_voice_1602301_23": "Eclipsites are not pure evil, just as Aurorians are not pure benevolence. They become lost because they are without guidance from the Lord of Truth.",

  "str_voice_1602301_49": "I can understand why the patriarchs shunned the Varaki bloodline, as well as my parents' desire to end their lives. That is why I was apathetic to everything around me when I experienced ascension.",
  "str_voice_1602301_5": "Some do believe in transcending oneself to obtain the power greater than the world, but one's \"self\" is not so easily transcended, and abandoning yourself strays from what Truth ordains.",

  "str_voice_1602301_8": "I have often explained to them that developing your perception is not to understand the world, for The Truth permeates too many dimensions. A truth gleaned from comprehending the world is not The Truth.",
  "str_voice_1602301_9": "The supreme truth hides in the extreme depths of emotion. The Aurorians close to you have already shown you their Truth. I eagerly await my journeys with you.",
  "str_voice_1602311_1": "PlayerName, keep that melon head of yours to yourself, and don't ever try to get into my head while pretending to be the Lord of Truth. You can't fool me now.",

  "str_voice_1602311_11": "Very well, I see you have a barren room ready for me. Don't worry, I won't complain about it being cramped.",
  "str_voice_1602311_12": "Unlike you, I don't welcome too many people in my keep, but if you come alone, I'll be considerate and at least provide a fitting casket for you.",

  "str_voice_1602311_48": "You can look forward to what you may receive in return.",
  "str_voice_1602311_49": "The Varakis have a history that is much longer than you think. If you're interested, I can recount the life of every forefather to you... That is, if you're interested.",
  "str_voice_1602311_5": "Every soul in this world is deeply blessed by The Truth. By offering our unwavering faith to the Lord of Truth, we can escape eternal torment.",
  "str_voice_1602311_50": "I thought I was following The Truth at the time, but to others, I was only betraying my brethren.",
  "str_voice_1602311_51": "I locked myself away in a keep on a precipice, only to find unexpected contentment and serenity.",
  "str_voice_1602311_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1602311_53": "Is someone looking for me?",
  "str_voice_1602311_54": "It's starting to get noisy.",
  "str_voice_1602311_55": "A lazy afternoon...",
  "str_voice_1602311_56": "Let's see who's napping already?",
  "str_voice_1602311_57": "Everyone can welcome a new year, just like everyone can welcome the river of The Truth.",
  "str_voice_1602311_6": "One day, you'll lie in that river as well. Then The Truth, like the star that burns the brightest in the night, will impale you, tear you apart, scorch you, rebuild you... until you're no longer you and become you again.",
  "str_voice_1602311_7": "I've told Nails many times already not to go about announcing me as his mentor. See, now you're here too... Huh? You don't want me as your mentor? Why, you don't think I'm good enough?",
  "str_voice_1602311_8": "Everyone has their own path to enlightenment, and I never interfere. But I don't want to see you straying too far off the course. You should be smart enough to know what I mean.",
  "str_voice_1602311_9": "I've completed my objective as a member of the Varaki family. Now, use your melon head and figure out which poor sap I can help out?",
  "str_voice_1602331_1": "Thanks for having me aboard the Colossus! This is my first time seeing such an airship; it feels so adventurous!",
  "str_voice_1602331_10": "Barrel!",
  "str_voice_1602331_11": "Heehee, welcome to my world-class Atelier! Even though it's just a temporary setup, I've already made lots of useful items for us. See if there's anything you can use!",
  "str_voice_1602331_12": "I traded materials with some of your friends from the Rediesel Wrench just now. They brought all kinds of unexpected stuff, like dried lizards and even cacti!",
  "str_voice_1602331_13": "A place I'd like to visit? Well, if I had the chance... I'd love to check out Lumopolis! Northland also sounds like a great choice... Ahh, I can't make up my mind!",
  "str_voice_1602331_14": "So many people in this world love exploring ruins too! Vice told me about some of her previous explorations; I feel like we could share stories for hours!",
  "str_voice_1602331_15": "Happy birthday! Impressive, huh? My friends and I prepared this just for you, and I used alchemy to create all the necessary items!",
  "str_voice_1602331_16": "I want to research this material... But where can I find it?",
  "str_voice_1602331_17": "Good morning! I'm fired up and ready to go whenever!",
  "str_voice_1602331_18": "Dinner was delicious, and I got to listen to all kinds of stories too!",
  "str_voice_1602331_19": "Phew... Thanks for helping me explore materials! Good night...",
  "str_voice_1602331_2": "Is there anything I can do to help you? My alchemy is perfect for turning seemingly ordinary materials into useful items!",
  "str_voice_1602331_20": "Another brand-new summer adventure for my otherwise ordinary life!",
  "str_voice_1602331_21": "It's decided! Next on my list is to see aurora in Northland.",
  "str_voice_1602331_22": "At its simplest, alchemy is the exploring and synthesizing of different materials!",
  "str_voice_1602331_23": "No enemy is too dangerous to stop our adventure!",
  "str_voice_1602331_24": "Klaudia's flute-playing is phenomenal; we should let her host a concerto again someday!",
  "str_voice_1602331_25": "I wonder how Patty's doing? I'd love to introduce her to some new friends!",
  "str_voice_1602331_26": "As an alchemist, my greatest wish is to acquire even more knowledge and techniques!",
  "str_voice_1602331_27": "If someone mistreats you, there's nothing wrong with fighting back!",
  "str_voice_1602331_28": "Flying across the world aboard a humongous airship... It's like something out of a dream!",
  "str_voice_1602331_29": "My name's Reisalin Stout, or Ryza for short! I'm a traveling alchemist, and my interests include visiting different worlds, exploring ruins, having summer adventures, and flying aboard this Colossus!",
  "str_voice_1602331_3": "Did you receive an interesting job request or something? Everyone looks so excited!",
  "str_voice_1602331_30": "I can still become stronger!",
  "str_voice_1602331_31": "Exploring complete!",
  "str_voice_1602331_32": "Synthesize succeed!",
  "str_voice_1602331_33": "Alright, it's finished!",
  "str_voice_1602331_34": "Take the first step and go!",
  "str_voice_1602331_35": "Time to get serious!",
  "str_voice_1602331_36": "Here we go!",
  "str_voice_1602331_37": "This is my ultimate move!",
  "str_voice_1602331_38": "Victory is ours! Grand Chariot!",
  "str_voice_1602331_39": "Attack—",
  "str_voice_1602331_4": "The Fireflies are so cute! If only I could use alchemy to create such adorable little helpers!",
  "str_voice_1602331_40": "Behold the power of alchemy!",
  "str_voice_1602331_41": "Alright, let's have some fun!",
  "str_voice_1602331_42": "Yes! We did it—!",
  "str_voice_1602331_43": "Guess I still need more training...",
  "str_voice_1602331_44": "I wonder if I can make these decorations using alchemy?",
  "str_voice_1602331_45": "Thanks! I was just looking for this!",
  "str_voice_1602331_46": "Wow! I can't wait to use this!",
  "str_voice_1602331_47": "What's this? How touching...",
  "str_voice_1602331_48": "I wasn't expecting such a wonderful gift today!",
  "str_voice_1602331_49": "Three years ago, I didn't know the first thing about alchemy. I was just a plain old farm girl finding ways to have fun each day.",
  "str_voice_1602331_5": "Astra has all sorts of useful materials! I can't wait to explore them for my research!",
  "str_voice_1602331_50": "Heheh, this isn't my first time venturing into another world... which is why I'm not too surprised by most of the things here!",
  "str_voice_1602331_51": "Always hold on to your desire for adventure, and never forget about the friends you've made along the way.",
  "str_voice_1602331_52": "Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1602331_53": "Hey, you!",
  "str_voice_1602331_54": "Good morning!",
  "str_voice_1602331_55": "Huh? Noon already?!",
  "str_voice_1602331_56": "Get a good night's sleep!",
  "str_voice_1602331_57": "Happy New Year! We're all excited to see what adventures this year has in store for us!",
  "str_voice_1602331_6": "Vice says \"alchemy\" is an ancient term in your world, used to describe an incredible mystical practice... I also hope to learn more alchemy knowledge and techniques in the future.",
  "str_voice_1602331_7": "Do you know how to fish? What's that? You actually love fishing?! Great, I'll make us a pair of fishing rods!",
  "str_voice_1602331_8": "Tell me about another one of your adventures! I'm dying to hear more about them!",
  "str_voice_1602331_9": "Thank you, Navigator, for all your help during our time on the island and on your Colossus... my friends and I have had an unforgettable summer!",
  "str_voice_1602333_1": "Even though I grew up surrounded by lakes, the vast sea is something I'll never tire of seeing!",
  "str_voice_1602333_10": "What's that floating towards us? It's a barrel!",
  "str_voice_1602333_11": "\"The more revealing the armor, the better its defense\"? I-Is that really how it works here in Astra?!",
  "str_voice_1602333_12": "Phew! That was fun and all, but I really need to cool off now! Got anything I can use, Navigator?",
  "str_voice_1602333_13": "Ahh... Spending summer with friends is the best!",
  "str_voice_1602333_14": "Bahahaha! You're totally soaked, Navigator! Good thing we're wearing swimsuits, right... H-Hey! Sneak attacks are not fair!",
  "str_voice_1602333_16": "The sea is beckoning us to start a new adventure!",
  "str_voice_1602333_17": "Morning! Did you sleep well? The cool breeze on the Colossus almost makes me forget that it's summer down below!",
  "str_voice_1602333_18": "Would you like a nice, refreshing drink? Ahh... I don't have my usual ingredients, but it still tastes great!",
  "str_voice_1602333_19": "Achoo! It gets a little chilly at night on the Colossus, huh? Oh, is this blanket for me? Thank you!",
  "str_voice_1602333_2": "Navigator, doesn't this fabric feel just like Eldrocode? Oh, sorry... You probably don't even know what that is...",
  "str_voice_1602333_3": "There are so many interesting things about Astra's oceans! For example... The sea urchins here actually live in the sea!",
  "str_voice_1602333_35": "Time for adventure!",
  "str_voice_1602333_36": "To the ocean!",
  "str_voice_1602333_37": "Vanish to the other side of the sea!",
  "str_voice_1602333_38": "I won't lose to anyone this summer!",
  "str_voice_1602333_39": "How's this?!",
  "str_voice_1602333_40": "Blast-off!",
  "str_voice_1602333_44": "Set sail for another amazing summer adventure!",
  "str_voice_1602341_1": "Sorry, I'm not interrupting anything, am I? Forgive me, I just wanted to say how amazing it is to see the world from atop your Colossus.",
  "str_voice_1602341_10": "Inbound volume... outbound volume... order count... Ah! My apologies, I know I shouldn't be doing this during my time off.",
  "str_voice_1602341_11": "Thank you for placing your trust in me. While we're still in your world, please allow me to help you with your finances.",
  "str_voice_1602341_12": "After discussing travel planning and safety with Ms. Blanc, I feel as though I've learned a great many things. Is this truly how Aurorians live in this world...?",
  "str_voice_1602341_13": "You think I have the potential to become an Umbraton guild leader? How kind of you to say so... But I'm relatively new to the world of business, and I still have much to learn.",
  "str_voice_1602341_14": "Thank you for your generosity, Navigator! You've been working so hard to ensure our safety and enjoyment, and we've made such wonderful memories. I just hope we can return the favor someday!",
  "str_voice_1602341_15": "Happy birthday, Navigator! Ryza and Patty prepared this gift for you, but I was the one who proposed the idea. I hope it is to your liking!",
  "str_voice_1602341_16": "You seem quite busy today... Would you like some help?",
  "str_voice_1602341_17": "Good morning, Navigator! I made you a cup of tea.",
  "str_voice_1602341_18": "Welcome back. How goes it today? See anything interesting?",
  "str_voice_1602341_19": "It's a bit late for stories, but there's always tomorrow. Good night!",
  "str_voice_1602341_2": "Wonderful! Now, my friends and I will have even more adventures to look back on... all thanks to you.",
  "str_voice_1602341_20": "My world's capital is a wonderful, bustling city, but I often find myself yearning for my adventuring days basking in the wilderness with Ryza.",
  "str_voice_1602341_21": "Many of our Aurorian friends have suggested I try working in Umbraton for a while. Do you reckon I really have what it takes to make it there?",
  "str_voice_1602341_22": "The Valentz Guild, at your service! ...Something like that, you suppose?",
  "str_voice_1602341_23": "Despite the threat of these monsters, the people of this world continue to survive and lead meaningful lives. It's truly admirable...",
  "str_voice_1602341_24": "Ryza always says she doesn't understand much outside of alchemy, but I'm never disappointed as long as she's by my side.",
  "str_voice_1602341_25": "Patty's always worrying that she isn't polite enough... But I think she's a perfectly well-mannered young noblewoman.",
  "str_voice_1602341_26": "Going on adventures with Ryza... and everyone else. That's the greatest treasure I could ever ask for.",
  "str_voice_1602341_27": "I want to contribute too, just like everyone else. I'm a lot maturer than I used to be, so please, let me take on more responsibility.",
  "str_voice_1602341_28": "There's something almost whimsical about it... A truly comfortable place where friends are always welcome.",
  "str_voice_1602341_29": "Excuse me, I'm Klaudia Valentz. Astra is entirely new to me. I truly appreciate your guidance!",
  "str_voice_1602341_3": "I often hear beautiful music flowing through the Colossus... Wait, you mean I can join in as well?",
  "str_voice_1602341_30": "I seem to have improved a bit.",
  "str_voice_1602341_31": "I can still fight!",
  "str_voice_1602341_32": "I must continue training.",
  "str_voice_1602341_33": "I'll protect you.",
  "str_voice_1602341_34": "I... I'll do my best!",
  "str_voice_1602341_35": "Fairies, guide me!",
  "str_voice_1602341_36": "Wind, lend me your strength!",
  "str_voice_1602341_37": "There's no avoiding the wind!",
  "str_voice_1602341_38": "This ends now! White Requiem!",
  "str_voice_1602341_39": "Strike!",
  "str_voice_1602341_4": "Miss Connolly seems to have something to tell me, which is perfect because I'd love to see her instruments... How should I approach her though...",
  "str_voice_1602341_40": "Whirlwind!",
  "str_voice_1602341_41": "(Deep breath) I've got this!",
  "str_voice_1602341_42": "Excellent work, everyone!",
  "str_voice_1602341_43": "I must remain calm and heal the wounded...",
  "str_voice_1602341_44": "Thank you for being a lovely host. I've also prepared some refreshments for everyone...",
  "str_voice_1602341_45": "Thank you for your gift.",
  "str_voice_1602341_46": "Oh my, you shouldn't have!",
  "str_voice_1602341_47": "A-Actually, I have something as well...",
  "str_voice_1602341_48": "Can... Can I really have this? Oh, thank you!",
  "str_voice_1602341_49": "I was born to a family of traveling merchants, so I spent much of my childhood accompanying my father on his journeys. As a result, I rarely made any friends my age.",
  "str_voice_1602341_5": "You want to learn how to think like a merchant from me so you can meet Miss Vice's demands and defend yourself from Mr. Jomu's marketing schemes? Hehe, I'm glad you have so much faith in me.",
  "str_voice_1602341_50": "Ryza and her friends saved my life in the forest one day. We've been friends ever since, going on all kinds of adventures together.",
  "str_voice_1602341_51": "Though I'm still following in my father's footsteps as a merchant, I believe my experiences with Ryza have changed me in many different ways.",
  "str_voice_1602341_52": "Alchemy Stars.",
  "str_voice_1602341_53": "Excuse us...",
  "str_voice_1602341_54": "Good morning!",
  "str_voice_1602341_55": "Would you like some tea?",
  "str_voice_1602341_56": "Please get some rest.",
  "str_voice_1602341_57": "Another new year. May your fantastic adventures continue well into the future, and bring you even more wonderful memories.",
  "str_voice_1602341_6": "Please feel free to entrust me with any support work. I may not be as lively as Ryza or Patty, but I can still accomplish plenty of things within my expertise.",
  "str_voice_1602341_7": "You look exhausted; would you like to take a short break? I can provide tea and snacks, if you're interested.",
  "str_voice_1602341_8": "Struggling to manage your mission expenses? I happen to have some experience in such matters... Perhaps I can help?",
  "str_voice_1602341_9": "I learned a number of Astra's recipes from our friends aboard the Colossus today. I can't wait to try them out someday!",
  "str_voice_1602371_1": "You play the piano? Perfect! I play the conch! Let's play together sometime!",
  "str_voice_1602371_10": "Are you taking a break? Would you like a sweet dream? I can help you with that.",
  "str_voice_1602371_11": "Okay! Let me know if I forget anything!",
  "str_voice_1602371_12": "I've learned a new trick, PlayerName! Wait here for a moment, and I'll show it to you!",
  "str_voice_1602371_13": "My parents are sleeping, and I live within their dreams. They'll be coming with my ancestor to play with me once I too go to sleep.",
  "str_voice_1602371_14": "PlayerName, I helped so many more people today. Look! Just look at these red little flowers they left on my notebook... Huh? You mean... these are from yesterday?",
  "str_voice_1602371_15": "Happy birthday! I'm grateful for your birth, and I like you.",
  "str_voice_1602371_16": "Hey! Wanna head out together?",
  "str_voice_1602371_17": "Hey! Anything I can help you with?",
  "str_voice_1602371_18": "Oh! Wanna go moon gazing?",
  "str_voice_1602371_19": "Yawn... I feel drowsy. Don't stay up late, okay?",
  "str_voice_1602371_2": "... Where was I again? Oh, do you play any instruments? Wanna learn how to play the conch from me?",
  "str_voice_1602371_20": "Everyone in Harbor City has been so nice to me, so I'll do my best to help you protect it, Elvis!",
  "str_voice_1602371_21": "That lady from the True Order wants to know what exists outside the bubble, but popping it will wake everyone up.",
  "str_voice_1602371_22": "Only when I fall asleep shall the world realize it is but a dream.",
  "str_voice_1602371_23": "The illusory bubble is slightly mottled. Those rebels are having nightmares, and they're making others nightmares too.",
  "str_voice_1602371_24": "I like Connolly because her music is so sweet to the ear.",
  "str_voice_1602371_25": "I like Zeta because she always gives me candy when she passes by. Huh? Why do I remember? Silly PlayerName, it's because I forgot to eat the candy, of course.",
  "str_voice_1602371_26": "Ice coffee is delicious. Can't help but drink too much.",
  "str_voice_1602371_27": "How do I refuse spicy food while not upsetting others?",
  "str_voice_1602371_28": "In my dreams, my ancestor always carries me to fly, but he doesn't have this many rooms.",
  "str_voice_1602371_29": "I remember you, PlayerName. I wrote about you in my notebook. You'd like to take a look, you say? No peeking! Even I have the right to keep the odd secret here and there.",
  "str_voice_1602371_3": "Wanna read together? I don't know many words though, so could you read to me instead? Yay! Thank you!",
  "str_voice_1602371_30": "My ancestor is calling me in dreams.",
  "str_voice_1602371_31": "Troubles are fleeting.",
  "str_voice_1602371_32": "Fate is but a bubble from my ancestor.",
  "str_voice_1602371_33": "The world may be my dream.",
  "str_voice_1602371_34": "I can help.",
  "str_voice_1602371_35": "Let's go!",
  "str_voice_1602371_36": "My ancestor is awakening.",
  "str_voice_1602371_37": "Let's go! Attack!",
  "str_voice_1602371_38": "Let's go! It's the finale!",
  "str_voice_1602371_39": "Bubble rhythm.",
  "str_voice_1602371_4": "My strength is your strength! Just say the word!",
  "str_voice_1602371_40": "Bubble light.",
  "str_voice_1602371_41": "I'll protect you.",
  "str_voice_1602371_42": "Hehe! Thank goodness you're unharmed!",
  "str_voice_1602371_43": "Help me, ancestor.",
  "str_voice_1602371_44": "That's a lot of books! Got any fairy tales? I wanna read some.",
  "str_voice_1602371_45": "I won't forget your kindness.",
  "str_voice_1602371_46": "You're my sweet dream.",
  "str_voice_1602371_47": "Thank you! You're making me blush!",
  "str_voice_1602371_48": "I like it! It makes my heart thump!",
  "str_voice_1602371_49": "I still remember how my mother used to take my hand and tell me a fairy tale every night. As the boat rocked with the waves, she soon fell asleep.",
  "str_voice_1602371_5": "The conch's tune whisks me off into the dreams of my revered ancestor. Those bubbles are actually his laughter—he has been of significant aid to me.",
  "str_voice_1602371_50": "I found this conch with my father. I just picked it up when I heard someone calling out to me, and I could play it by instinct. It led me to my ancestor in dreams.",
  "str_voice_1602371_51": "Sometimes, I can meet my ancestor even without playing the conch. It seems to be guiding me to mend a very, very huge dream. Huh? What might happen to the world if everyone wakes up?",
  "str_voice_1602371_52": "Alchemy... Hmm... Oh! Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1602371_53": "Bubble!",
  "str_voice_1602371_54": "Shiny sun.",
  "str_voice_1602371_55": "Feeling lazy.",
  "str_voice_1602371_56": "Did you have a dream?",
  "str_voice_1602371_57": "Today's the most special day of them all! I have so many gifts for you! Please spend the day with me!",
  "str_voice_1602371_6": "PlayerName, you smell of a dream. Fear not, I shall play the conch if they refuse to stay away from you...",
  "str_voice_1602371_7": "You are very kind to me... It's true, I can sense it!",
  "str_voice_1602371_8": "I like you! Huh? Why are you blushing?",
  "str_voice_1602371_9": "I like you! Huh? Why are you looking away? Hmm... I feel like I'm forgetting something. Well, whatever! I just like you!",
  "str_voice_1602381_1": "I'm still learning how to balance being a Courier while also being a defender of justice.",
  "str_voice_1602381_10": "... Feeling tired? Fine, I suppose a break at a reasonable time isn't a breach of agreement. Good work today.",
  "str_voice_1602381_11": "Just so we're clear, you want me to supervise your work. Is that correct?",
  "str_voice_1602381_12": "Lady Freya's kindness is stunning, even to me... It appears I still have much to learn.",
  "str_voice_1602381_13": "Raven feathers aren't entirely black. If you look closely, you can distinguish all the colors they're comprised of... What's the matter? I thought discerning light and colors was your specialty?",
  "str_voice_1602381_14": "The Star Warriors seem to feel guilt towards our clan, none more so than Lord Achilles... If possible, please convince them that there's no need to feel remorseful, and that aiding them has been our greatest honor.",
  "str_voice_1602381_15": "Happy birthday. Hmm? Don't look so surprised. I've sworn to remember this day for the rest of my life, and offer you my best wishes every single year.",
  "str_voice_1602381_16": "Care to experience a truly diverse work environment with me?",

  "str_voice_1602381_23": "Those cold-blooded creatures of darkness are completely devoid of emotion and self-awareness. Sadly, at their core, they're no different than us.",
  "str_voice_1602381_24": "Goldie and I are not the same. She's a songbird who thrives in the light of day, while I'm a raven who hunts in the dead of night. We only came to know each other through a chance encounter at night.",

Unlike Goldie, who fights for justice in the night, I'm just taking my anger out on a few criminals... If I don't change soon, I may eventually develop a proclivity towards this kind of violence.",

  "str_voice_1602411_29": "Right, let's just get introductions out of the way. The name's Pepita, and no, I'm not \"that girl\" or \"that small creature,\" but Pepita. Pepita the Fighter.",

  "str_voice_1602411_49": "Like everyone else in Illumina, I had a pretty rough childhood. My father... Ugh, I hate calling him that. Anyway, that coward's the reason my mom died, and also why I ended up in the lab.",

  "str_voice_1602411_7": "Woof! Hahaha, did I scare you? Don't worry, I don't bite... At least not without a good reason!",
  "str_voice_1602411_8": "Think you can teach me how to pilot the Colossus? We travel way too slowly! I can push it beyond its limits! No? Oh, c'mon, I thought we were friends!",
  "str_voice_1602411_9": "Let me clue you in on a little secret: you're the perfect kind of friend for me. You care about me without constantly sticking your nose in my business, so... Thanks for everything.",
  "str_voice_1701071_1": "Huh? Need my expertise to lead the next battle?",
  "str_voice_1701071_10": "Since we have nothing better to do, let me sing my favorite song from the base. Everyone usually gets moving when I start singing.",

  "str_voice_1701071_16": "My job now is to guard this Colossus and destroy all of our enemies, provided they're Eclipsites, of course.",
  "str_voice_1701071_17": "Morning. Assemble everyone on Soroz to run 50 laps... No? I can see they are trouble.",
  "str_voice_1701071_18": "It's time to relax a bit, but don't stay up too late.",
  "str_voice_1701071_19": "Shouldn't you be sleeping? Let me take the next watch.",
  "str_voice_1701071_2": "What's the matter? You can always use more work after training.",
  "str_voice_1701071_20": "I only remember serving with fellow soldiers... Sorry, I can't recall anything else.",
  "str_voice_1701071_21": "This land is home to many thriving powers... But, the way I see it, things are only becoming more chaotic.",
  "str_voice_1701071_22": "I'm the Guardian of the North.",
  "str_voice_1701071_23": "It is our biggest foe, and hopefully the only foe for all Aurorians.",

  "str_voice_1701071_27": "I hate large Eclipsites for I have trouble sending them flying far.",

  "str_voice_1701071_48": "Thank you. Though you probably can't tell, I'm happy.",
  "str_voice_1701071_49": "I'm guessing I was a farmer-turned-soldier. I vaguely remember my fellows, but when I try to focus, the memory fractures even more.",
  "str_voice_1701071_5": "No jinx, it's not a real casket... Well, it probably isn't... I forget.",
  "str_voice_1701071_50": "I have a hazy memory of when I enlisted, became an officer, and had an audience with the king... Then the Eclipsites invaded, and Claymore invited me to join the Silent Hunters...",
  "str_voice_1701071_51": "We saved the kingdom from the crisis, only to be spurned by a fearful populace. Then... Then... I think I've forgotten something very crucial, something that meant a lot to me...",

  "str_voice_1701071_56": "Time to rest. Turn the lights off immediately.",
  "str_voice_1701071_57": "Happy New Year. Did someone say my sword looks a little ominous...?",
  "str_voice_1701071_6": "Don't stare at me all the time. Do something.",
  "str_voice_1701071_7": "I indeed lost some of my memory, but it has no impact on my efficiency in killing Eclipsites.",
  "str_voice_1701071_8": "I suddenly remember farming in a rye field... Is that me?",
  "str_voice_1701071_9": "It's good that you can use a shield. Sword, on the other hand, not yet.",
  "str_voice_1701073_1": "Strange... I've been having cruel dreams lately, and they're so vivid. What? You mean maybe they're not dreams but forgotten memories?",
  "str_voice_1701073_10": "Too weak to speak? You must be starved. Do you have any flour? I still remember how to bake bread, and it is on par with what you have here. Would you like to try it?",
  "str_voice_1701073_11": "At your service.",
  "str_voice_1701073_12": "The biggest threat to the world has not changed... No, I speak not of the Eclipsites.",
  "str_voice_1701073_13": "Protecting people is my life's purpose. Despite past tragedies, I will not give up.",
  "str_voice_1701073_14": "Do you know the scent of grown wheat? Light and sweet, pervading the nostrils in the heat. It's a sensation I can't even afford to dream about anymore.",
  "str_voice_1701073_16": "Do not be complacent even when Eclipsites aren't present. Protecting you is my sole duty now, PlayerName.",
  "str_voice_1701073_17": "Morning! Come face the new day in high spirits with me!",
  "str_voice_1701073_18": "One must be even more vigilant when the night falls, though that's a task for me. For you, your duty is to get a good rest.",
  "str_voice_1701073_19": "Sleep well. Not even nightmares dare approach with me standing guard.",
  "str_voice_1701073_2": "Adras... so this is my name? And you helped me find it again. I should say... thank you.",
  "str_voice_1701073_3": "A Silent Hunter's fighting spirit can never be quelled, no matter what happens.",

  "str_voice_1701073_58": "Eclipsites are no more than creatures long on brawn, and short on brains.",

  "str_voice_1701101_10": "La-da-da... I could get used to this laid-back life. Since you don't have much going on now, how about I chill with you out of the goodness of my heart?",
  "str_voice_1701101_11": "Got it, got it! Leave it to the great Silent Saint and most powerful Freya, the \"Requiem\" from Silent Hunters, to help the useless Navigator! What, you're going to make me work? You mean it?",
  "str_voice_1701101_12": "It's a scanty costume? Well, considering my spells can fry Eclipsites into a crisp from a mile away, I don't have to be fully loaded like Adras!",
  "str_voice_1701101_13": "You want me to call out to you like a cat? Are you okay in the head? I'm now very concerned about your mental health.",
  "str_voice_1701101_14": "If I had impaled the Navigator for touching me just now, maybe they'd start calling me the \"Untouchable Saint\"... That does sound appealing, no?",

  "str_voice_1701101_16": "Any plans for the day? Nothing? Unbelievable... Want my input?",
  "str_voice_1701101_17": "Morning! I thought you're going to sleep in till the afternoon. Anyway, good morning!",
  "str_voice_1701101_18": "I've decided to schedule the Navigator's day! What?\nIt's way past the time? Damn, just when I finally want to help!",
  "str_voice_1701101_19": "Okay, I'm off now. You can take over the shift now, Navigator... What? No way? How could you say that!",
  "str_voice_1701101_2": "I was often called a saint, but I don't handle confessions and atonements. You'll have to see someone else for that.",
  "str_voice_1701101_20": "Let bygones be bygones! I've slept so much that the past feels so far away... But it is pretty fun loitering over here while searching for our next target.",
  "str_voice_1701101_21": "Illumina and Lumopolis seem to be full of nothing but dullards... As for Northland... Make sure you take me with you next time!",
  "str_voice_1701101_22": "We are the conciliators of borderlands!",
  "str_voice_1701101_23": "Hate them, hate them very much.\nEven if I was not so righteous, I would still want to pound their ugly faces in.",
  "str_voice_1701101_24": "Things used to be complicated between Friegson and Cynthia! I heard Friegson even attacked her once, but now they're on much better terms!",
  "str_voice_1701101_25": "Adras is a beast, whether it's combat prowess or magic you're talking about! Wait, Navigator, are you jealous? You're kind of cute when you're like this...",
  "str_voice_1701101_26": "Why can't I like chocolate and other sweets?! Everyone else likes them, too... Shut up, you, not a word!",
  "str_voice_1701101_27": "I hate Eclipsites and you. Oops, don't cry! I'm sorry... If you must know, I do like you better!",
  "str_voice_1701101_28": "No thoughts are other than living comfortably, sorry.",
  "str_voice_1701101_29": "Nice to meet you. I'm Requiem with the Silent Hunters. Anyway, let me do all the fighting and keep your klutzy self out of my way.",
  "str_voice_1701101_3": "Huh? Where are you, Navigator? Oh, there you are! You sure blend into the crowd, just like a wallflower!",
  "str_voice_1701101_30": "Wow! That's what I'm talking about!",
  "str_voice_1701101_34": "Alright... Step aside and let me show you!",
  "str_voice_1701101_35": "No survivors!",

  "str_voice_1701101_39": "Forward and onward!",
  "str_voice_1701101_4": "Why Requiem? Because I can see spirits, such as those behind you right now... Just kidding, ha-ha!",
  "str_voice_1701101_40": "It's not over yet!",
  "str_voice_1701101_41": "I promise to live up to your expectations.",
  "str_voice_1701101_42": "Of course. Just appreciate me with all your heart.",
  "str_voice_1701101_43": "*Sobs* How could this happen? Sorry...",
  "str_voice_1701101_44": "Huh? Have you come to thank me specifically?",
  "str_voice_1701101_45": "Hey, not bad.",
  "str_voice_1701101_46": "This is unexpected. I'll take it!",
  "str_voice_1701101_47": "Thanks... Stop looking at me!",
  "str_voice_1701101_48": "Oh, this is... uh, thanks! I like it very much. You're so nice!",
  "str_voice_1701101_49": "Let me think. I'm pretty sure... I was born to a perfect family, so it makes sense for me to be this flawless, right?",
  "str_voice_1701101_5": "Hovering around me without any precaution... You might just end up getting yourself impaled, Navigator...",
  "str_voice_1701101_50": "It's a boring job whether I'm a military chaplain or a drill officer, having to nag people older than me about repentance and following the rules all day! I expect grown-ups to behave themselves!",
  "str_voice_1701101_51": "Well, I don't know what was up with me. This is what I became after following the Claymore's advice. Still not bad though, right?",
  "str_voice_1701101_52": "Yeah, Alchemy Stars!",
  "str_voice_1701101_53": "Hey, Navigator!",
  "str_voice_1701101_54": "Hey, are you up?",
  "str_voice_1701101_55": "Wake up, stop sleeping!",
  "str_voice_1701101_56": "Oh, so sleepy...",
  "str_voice_1701101_57": "It's the New Year! Praise the time off!",
  "str_voice_1701101_6": "Say, go make yourself busy. No need to keep an eye on me; I'm not going anywhere.",
  "str_voice_1701101_7": "How about sparring me if you got nothing better to do? Don't look at me that way. I killed a wolf with one punch before... It would take even less to deal with you, poor little Navigator.",
  "str_voice_1701101_8": "No matter how you count it, I'm not 19 yet... Or are you just dying to find out what happens to people who grill me like this?",
  "str_voice_1701101_9": "On second thought, you're a nice guy... How about letting me call you \"My dear\" out of appreciation? You would? I was just joking!",
  "str_voice_1701103_1": "Adventure in the dream is interesting, right? Remember to take me with you on the next one, but not if it's for one of the other Silent Hunters. Their dreams would probably be way too dark.",
  "str_voice_1701103_10": "Hmm? What's with that blank expression on your face? Don't tell me... is my saintly aura stunning you into silence?",
  "str_voice_1701103_11": "Ah, so the mighty Navigator finally recognizes my greatness, and has come to seek my sage counsel! What's that? You just need help with your work? Ugh... How disappointing.",
  "str_voice_1701103_12": "Though Northland is a cold and inhospitable place, the people there have always forged onward through the wind and snow. I'm proud to play the role of savior for strong and hard-working people like that.",
  "str_voice_1701103_13": "My comrades and I have been through it all: howling blizzards, raging storms, extreme cold, and countless Eclipsite attacks. The greatness of our kind doesn't lie in the blessings of the divine, but in the unquenchable fires that burn in our hearts.",
  "str_voice_1701103_14": "For generations, the Silent Saintesses have burned away their lives in order to help others, which is why they never lived for particularly long. Compared to them, I've led a long and happy life even though I'm only nineteen!",
  "str_voice_1701103_16": "Still pacing around at this hour, eh? Looks like even the great Navigator has trouble making plans of his own. As the smarter and more mature person here, allow me to assist you.",
  "str_voice_1701103_17": "Let me stay in bed! I already performed my saintly duties, now leave me alone!",
  "str_voice_1701103_18": "I'm off to eat with everyone else. Care to join us? Adras is cooking today, you know!",
  "str_voice_1701103_19": "Why are you still loitering around like this? Do you want to hear a bedtime story? If so, go ask Cynthia.",
  "str_voice_1701103_2": "Alright fine, as a reward for our long-standing friendship, I will now hear your confession... Huh? Why are you still standing around? I don't always have free time on my hands, so start confessing!",
  "str_voice_1701103_3": "Stop! I already know what you're about to say, and the answer is no: just because I'm the \"Silent Saintess\" doesn't mean I have to keep quiet all the time. Titles aren't meant to be taken literally, you know?",
  "str_voice_1701103_35": "Prepare for the blast.",
  "str_voice_1701103_36": "Allow me to intercede.",
  "str_voice_1701103_37": "Cleansed by thunder!",
  "str_voice_1701103_38": "Let all become silent—!",
  "str_voice_1701103_39": "Ride the storm!",
  "str_voice_1701103_40": "Command the thunder!",
  "str_voice_1701103_44": "So this is what peace feels like... Incredible.",
  "str_voice_1701103_58": "Thunder! And then, silence!",
  "str_voice_1701103_59": "A feast?! Where?!",
  "str_voice_1701103_60": "Mmm, this is the only reason why I bothered to come.",
  "str_voice_1701103_61": "Care for a little combat training, Navigator? I promise to pull my punches if you do.",
  "str_voice_1701103_62": "Freya, the sharpest lance of the Silent Hunters, has arrived!",
  "str_voice_1701103_63": "Freya the Flawless has arrived!",
  "str_voice_1701103_64": "Huh? Where'd everybody go?",
  "str_voice_1701103_65": "Ugh... Is it really that far away? I would've brought a horse if I knew that.",
  "str_voice_1701103_66": "Oh, what a lovely little surprise. The great Freya humbly accepts your gift.",
  "str_voice_1702361_1": "Long ago, the kingdom needed stars to shatter the darkness, so my comrades bravely stepped up and burned themselves out... Their ashes remain as stardust, and time will never erase those noble souls.",
  "str_voice_1702361_10": "The force that surrounds me... I call it Star Power, for it often whispers to me, telling me of starry scenes.",
  "str_voice_1702361_11": "Another Caelestite found me after Ludweiss. He hadn't seen the light of hope, like Ludweiss, but was equally determined to burn his soul. They're the real heroes, and I must sing of their exploits.",
  "str_voice_1702361_12": "Those fixated on profit or power are not fit to judge us, let alone record our stories with their narrow vision!",
  "str_voice_1702361_13": "We will stay true to ourselves, keeping silent guard and forever fighting evil. So it has been for two millennia, and so it will be for two more.",
  "str_voice_1702361_14": "I was not brave enough back then, which caused so much tragedy for my comrades. But luckily there are those who still love us, and they have passed the torch and allowed us to meet again. I owe you so much and cannot tell you how grateful I am...",
  "str_voice_1702361_15": "Happy birthday. I got Adras to teach me how to make you a cake.",
  "str_voice_1702361_16": "Anything you'd like to share?",
  "str_voice_1702361_17": "I never thought I'd see the sun again.",
  "str_voice_1702361_18": "Wanna warm up by the campfire?",
  "str_voice_1702361_19": "It's late. Watch out for those voices. Don't rashly trust those voices in your head, especially at night.",
  "str_voice_1702361_2": "Our old Caelestite comrade, Ludweiss... She made the ultimate sacrifice for us. I will continue her legacy, even if I'm the only one who remembers.",
  "str_voice_1702361_20": "Silent Hunter is a title I thought I'd buried. It represents many things... heroism, sacrifice, betrayal, and... hope.",
  "str_voice_1702361_21": "Northland? Oh... The kingdom now lives in the light of peace and good fortune, and that's enough.",
  "str_voice_1702361_22": "We are watchers of justice.",
  "str_voice_1702361_23": "They are not our only enemies, but they're the ones I solely wish to aim my sword at.",
  "str_voice_1702361_24": "Ludweiss loved to keep records, and I promised her I'd carry everything on. These days I love the world on her behalf.",
  "str_voice_1702361_25": "Don't be scared of my comrades. Lower your weapons, they're merely a baker, a joyful girl, a nervous guard, and someone who thirsts for peace.",
  "str_voice_1702361_26": "Everyone lives happily here, thank you.",
  "str_voice_1702361_27": "Books these days even glorify villains. I don't get it...",
  "str_voice_1702361_28": "You're lucky to be able to accomplish righteous deeds with your friends.",
  "str_voice_1702361_29": "Caelestite... Ah, forgive me. Long ago our noble Caelestite comrades sacrificed everything for us. Now I will protect the last of their kind.",
  "str_voice_1702361_3": "Friegson's a tough kid. Like Adras, she's never had a happy childhood and doesn't even have anyone special to remember. Don't blame her attitude, she's just exhausted.",
  "str_voice_1702361_30": "Rich darkness, at my disposal.",
  "str_voice_1702361_31": "Be careful, Caelestite.",
  "str_voice_1702361_32": "Abundant Star Power.",

  "str_voice_1702361_39": "All unharmed, right?",
  "str_voice_1702361_4": "Thank you, Caelestite. You've helped all our regrets and allowed me to fulfill my promise—to reunite with my comrades.",
  "str_voice_1702361_40": "Protect the Caelestite. I'll cover the rear!",
  "str_voice_1702361_41": "Greetings. I'm recording new information.",
  "str_voice_1702361_42": "Thank you, Caelestite.",

  "str_voice_1702361_44": "I'll record your kindness.",
  "str_voice_1702361_45": "I have nothing in return... unless you'd like to see my notes?",
  "str_voice_1702361_46": "A long, long time ago, I was called the Hand of the King. I acted with loyalty and conviction and fought relentlessly for the kingdom. My close friend was on the throne back then, and it was he who supported my uncompromising self.",
  "str_voice_1702361_47": "Since when was I left with nothing but friends? I don't know. Perhaps it was my unwavering stance that made everyone else see me as an enemy, but the only thing I couldn't accept was betrayal from the king.",
  "str_voice_1702361_48": "Later, I chose to seal my comrades, but I didn't expect the price to be my friend's sacrifice. I swore to secure a future for them, so I must remain in the past... Don't be sad, for if you see me now, it means I've already traversed the years.",

  "str_voice_1702361_6": "The Last Caelestite... What a sorrowful moniker. Have you also been waiting alone, hoping to meet your fellows? Don't look so forlorn. If I can reunite with my comrades, maybe you can meet your kind too. Let us help.",
  "str_voice_1702361_7": "Have a rest, feel the wind of freedom, and listen to the music of life.",
  "str_voice_1702361_8": "In the name of Achilles, I will protect you.",
  "str_voice_1702361_9": "I used to be able to use magic, but these days this body no longer receives the blessing of Lumina. It doesn't matter though. Even if I tumble into the abyss, I can still summon starlight to resist fate."
