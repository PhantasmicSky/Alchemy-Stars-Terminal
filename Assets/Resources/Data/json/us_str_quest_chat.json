  "str_quest_chat_10104005": "In my time of dire need... I heard your voice, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_10104006": "After that, you and I fought together to defeat the hordes of Eclipsites that came at us like waves on a raging sea. Eventually, we met up with our companions and survived...",

  "str_quest_chat_10105003": "The Colossus is really all sorts of fantastic... But it seems that it can only be used to communicate inside the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_10105004": "That's fine. We can split up around the Colossus. That way, the next time Eclipsites attack, we can at least inform each other.",

  "str_quest_chat_10142005": "H-Hey! I told you that it was my winning shot!",

  "str_quest_chat_10142011": "I-I-I wasn't aiming at you! I was just trying to communicate with you telepathically! After all, you have psychic abilities, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_10142012": "Say, are you hungry? L-Let's go out for a bite, my treat!",
  "str_quest_chat_10142013": "Sure... We can talk about your \"target practice\" while we're at it.",
  "str_quest_chat_10142014": "A-ha-ha... W-What are you even talking about...",

  "str_quest_chat_10158006": "If you have the time, try some quick, short exercises.",

  "str_quest_chat_10158009": "Don't mention it!",
  "str_quest_chat_10159001": "Morning! I'm heading to the Gannon walkathon!",
  "str_quest_chat_10159002": "Morning, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_10159003": "What do you mean by walkathon?",
  "str_quest_chat_10159004": "It's a group activity where everyone agrees to meet at an appointed time and place to walk a distance together!",
  "str_quest_chat_10159005": "Ahh, enough talking, I'll heading out, I'm gonna be late!",
  "str_quest_chat_10159006": "Such enthusiasm.",
  "str_quest_chat_10161001": "Did you have beef with rice for lunch today?",
  "str_quest_chat_10161002": "How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_10161003": "Was it delicious?",
  "str_quest_chat_10161004": "Half of the steak was rare. I was speechless...",
  "str_quest_chat_10161005": "I cooked it. I made arrangements for Illumina to supply us with some premium steak, and I had to line up for ages to get it.",
  "str_quest_chat_10161006": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_10162001": "Why am I always sleepy at noon...",
  "str_quest_chat_10162002": "Vice, you must be up really early in the morning, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_10162003": "I guess so. I got up at 8am today.",
  "str_quest_chat_10162004": "... If you got up at 8am, then why did you set my alarm for 7am!",
  "str_quest_chat_10163001": "The afternoon training is about to begin!",
  "str_quest_chat_10163002": "Isn't it lunch break?",
  "str_quest_chat_10163003": "You've been on lunch break for two hours already!",
  "str_quest_chat_10163004": "Has it been that long...",
  "str_quest_chat_10163005": "Don't even think of slacking off!",
  "str_quest_chat_10163006": "Coming!",
  "str_quest_chat_10164001": "Good afternoon. Are you in your room?",
  "str_quest_chat_10164002": "Yes. I'm going to have a little nap soon.",
  "str_quest_chat_10164003": "Ah... That's a shame!",
  "str_quest_chat_10164004": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_10164005": "I just finished reading a book about physical training, so I'm gonna go try out some of these new techniques!",
  "str_quest_chat_10164006": "Ahahaha! That's not exactly what I'd call a shame...",
  "str_quest_chat_10164007": "Well, you go rest and we can find another time! Let's make a plan in advance.",
  "str_quest_chat_10164008": "...Leave me alone!",
  "str_quest_chat_10165001": "Aren't you supposed to be napping?",
  "str_quest_chat_10165002": "No, I'm eating lunch right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_10165003": "Fine, go ahead eating! I got my hands on Illumina's tastiest snacks!",
  "str_quest_chat_10165004": "But if you're not interested... I'll eat them all myself!",
  "str_quest_chat_10165005": "...Wait, wait! I can still eat!",
  "str_quest_chat_10166001": "Hmm... I can't finish all my lunch again today.",
  "str_quest_chat_10166002": "You haven't been eating much for the past few days.",
  "str_quest_chat_10166003": "I've been... gaining weight.",
  "str_quest_chat_10166004": "Seriously? I can't tell.",
  "str_quest_chat_10166005": "In the tail...",
  "str_quest_chat_10166006": "Uh... That doesn't matter, does it...?",
  "str_quest_chat_10166007": "It's gonna affect my balance!",
  "str_quest_chat_10166008": "R-Right... That's true...",
  "str_quest_chat_10167001": "The most embarrassing thing just happened, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_10167002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_10167003": "I dozed off at the table right after lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_10167004": "Good thing I wasn't out for long!",
  "str_quest_chat_10167005": "You didn't snore, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat_10167006": "What? Me? No, no way!",
  "str_quest_chat_10167007": "I... just drooled a little...",
  "str_quest_chat_10167008": "But I wiped it off pretty fast!",
  "str_quest_chat_10167009": "Haha, it's not a big deal, really...",
  "str_quest_chat_10167010": "Just go and take a nap, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_10167011": "You're right...",
  "str_quest_chat_10168001": "I'm so energetic thanks to my morning coffee!",
  "str_quest_chat_10168002": "Isn't that a good thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_10168003": "But when I tried to take a nap at noon...",
  "str_quest_chat_10168004": "You just couldn't fall asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_10168005": "Yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat_10168006": "I'm still wired from the coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat_10168007": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_10168008": "Then forget about napping. How about just closing your eyes and resting your mind for a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_10168009": "That's... a good idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_10169001": "I've been feeling really fatigued in the afternoons recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_10169002": "Do you feel like that as well, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_10169003": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_10169004": "I find it hard to keep my spirits up these days...",
  "str_quest_chat_10169005": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat_10169006": "I think I feel pretty alright?",
  "str_quest_chat_10169007": "Have you made any adjustments to your schedule lately, Vice?",
  "str_quest_chat_10169008": "Not really, which makes it all the more strange.",
  "str_quest_chat_10169009": "... Oh wait, I think I get it now!",
  "str_quest_chat_10169010": "Could it be due to the recent change of seasons?",
  "str_quest_chat_10169011": "Hmm, that does make sense. We are affected by external changes.",
  "str_quest_chat_10169012": "Huh! Guess I had best hurry and get some shut-eye then!",
  "str_quest_chat_10181001": "PlayerName, supper?",
  "str_quest_chat_10181002": "At this hour?!",
  "str_quest_chat_10181003": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_10181004": "... Aren't you worried about gaining weight?",
  "str_quest_chat_10181005": "I won't.",
  "str_quest_chat_10181006": "But I will!",
  "str_quest_chat_10182001": "PlayerName, I can't sleep... Will you chat with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_10182002": "... What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_10182003": "I read a creepy story just now. Interested?",
  "str_quest_chat_10182004": "... No!",
  "str_quest_chat_10182005": "Did your cabinet move?",
  "str_quest_chat_10182006": "Stop it!",
  "str_quest_chat_10183001": "I'm guessing that you're still awake!",
  "str_quest_chat_10183002": "I don't know if I should reply you that I'm asleep or awake...",
  "str_quest_chat_10183003": "You should sleep soon if you're still awake!",
  "str_quest_chat_10183004": "I'm about to fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_10183005": "I'll check on you in five minutes!",
  "str_quest_chat_10183006": "??",
  "str_quest_chat_10184001": "Good work today!",
  "str_quest_chat_10184002": "Same to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_10184003": "Since you've been working so hard, how about a cup of my special post-work relaxation tonic?",
  "str_quest_chat_10184004": "Erm... I'm not so sure I like the sound of that... given the interesting creations you've come up with in the past...",
  "str_quest_chat_10184005": "Trust me! I've been studying up on the subject! I know what I'm doing this time!",
  "str_quest_chat_10184006": "Hmm... Alright. I believe in you, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_10184007": "...But I really can't drink anything right now. How about next time?",
  "str_quest_chat_10184008": "...That's too obvious, you don't have any faith in me.",
  "str_quest_chat_10185001": "Good evening! Tomorrow's training schedule is gonna be another tough one!",
  "str_quest_chat_10185002": "But yesterday's was so intense...",
  "str_quest_chat_10185003": "Navigator, you're not getting lazy now, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_10185004": "You slept in the day before yesterday!",
  "str_quest_chat_10185005": "If you want some high-quality training tomorrow, you should really get to sleep now!",
  "str_quest_chat_10185006": "...Alright. Well, goodnight then.",
  "str_quest_chat_10185007": "Goodnight, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_10186001": "PlayerName, I've been thinking...",
  "str_quest_chat_10186002": "About what?",
  "str_quest_chat_10186003": "It's late. You should be sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_10186004": "What if we make Soldier's Boiled Rice instead of fried rice? What would it taste like?",
  "str_quest_chat_10186005": "It tastes good enough as it is now...",
  "str_quest_chat_10186006": "I'll try it tomorrow!",
  "str_quest_chat_10186007": "Vice!",
  "str_quest_chat_10187001": "I tried using skin care products today!",
  "str_quest_chat_10187002": "But my skin doesn't really feel any different...",
  "str_quest_chat_10187003": "Yeah, I've heard of other people using such products...",
  "str_quest_chat_10187004": "Right? They're supposed to make your skin look better.",
  "str_quest_chat_10187005": "Why don't you keep using it and see what happens?",
  "str_quest_chat_10187006": "I will!",
  "str_quest_chat_10187007": "I'll write up a report for you after my experimentation!",
  "str_quest_chat_10187008": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_10187009": "That's... probably not necessary...",
  "str_quest_chat_10188001": "Ugh... training was too tough today.",
  "str_quest_chat_10188002": "What kind of training was it?",
  "str_quest_chat_10188003": "The physical kind...",
  "str_quest_chat_10188004": "But Sharona trained us herself today!",
  "str_quest_chat_10188005": "So... It was more rigorous than usual?",
  "str_quest_chat_10188006": "\"Rigorous\" doesn't even begin to describe it!",
  "str_quest_chat_10188007": "\"Torture\" would be a better word.",
  "str_quest_chat_10188008": "But that should help you sleep better, right? Consider what your body just went through...",
  "str_quest_chat_10188009": "That is true...",
  "str_quest_chat_10188010": "By the way, the reason Sharona came to train us herself...",
  "str_quest_chat_10188011": "Probably is because we've been slacking off a bit lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_10188012": "You people...",
  "str_quest_chat_10188013": "Heehee! Well then, time for me to turn in, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_10188014": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_10188015": "Good night, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_10189001": "Tonight...",
  "str_quest_chat_10189002": "I ate a really, really huge...",
  "str_quest_chat_10189003": "Steak with rice.",
  "str_quest_chat_10189004": "You sound...",
  "str_quest_chat_10189005": "Are you alright? Maybe you ate too much.",
  "str_quest_chat_10189006": "I think so.",
  "str_quest_chat_10189007": "I feel like my body's using all my energy just to digest this.",
  "str_quest_chat_10189008": "So, I'm sleepy earlier than usual today...",
  "str_quest_chat_10189009": "Well, I'm gonna go get some rest, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_10189010": "Well, I agree it'll be better to rest now since that's the case.",
  "str_quest_chat_10189011": "But eat less next time, alright?",
  "str_quest_chat_10189012": "Yes, yes, I know already. Night then!",
  "str_quest_chat_10189013": "Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_10751001": "Afternoon, Navigator!",

  "str_quest_chat_10751005": "Those Fireflies... Can I take one?",
  "str_quest_chat_10751006": "That way, I could have my very own Speaker!",
  "str_quest_chat_10751007": "But... The Fireflies can only live aboard a Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_10751008": "Ah, I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_10762001": "Navigator, a firefly's been bugging me!",
  "str_quest_chat_10762002": "Ah... I'll get on it.",
  "str_quest_chat_10762003": "It's okay. I caught it myself!",
  "str_quest_chat_10762004": "Let see if I can make it my Speaker!",
  "str_quest_chat_10762005": "W-Wait! Don't do it!",
  "str_quest_chat_10762006": "Just messing with ya! I let it go already.",

  "str_quest_chat_10763001": "I'm so tired!",
  "str_quest_chat_10763002": "It's noon already, take a break.",
  "str_quest_chat_10763003": "I got spotted by Eclipsites while on delivery this morning and got chased around...",
  "str_quest_chat_10763004": "I could've gotten away real quick if I had a Speaker.",
  "str_quest_chat_10763005": "But that's not something you can just wish for...",
  "str_quest_chat_10763006": "True.",

  "str_quest_chat_10764003": "I've got a letter here for you, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_10764004": "Thanks, I'll go pick it up right now! Where can I find you?",
  "str_quest_chat_10764005": "Heehee! Actually... I hid the letter in a secret spot!",
  "str_quest_chat_10764006": "Let's see if you can find it!",
  "str_quest_chat_10764007": "Huh? Why do I have to go looking for it?",
  "str_quest_chat_10764008": "B-Because it's more fun that way, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_10764009": "It totally has nothing to do with me misplacing it, or anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_10764010": "Is that what happened?!",
  "str_quest_chat_10765001": "Dear Mr. Navigator, may I ask if you have eaten lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_10765002": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_10765003": "I must say, you chose a perfect time to partake in an afternoon meal!",
  "str_quest_chat_10765004": "I-Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_10765005": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_10765006": "I see! My services are always available, should you require expedient meal delivery!",
  "str_quest_chat_10765007": "S-Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_10765008": "Uh, Pepi...? Why are you being so polite today?",
  "str_quest_chat_10765009": "As one of my valued clients, I'm simply addressing you in the proper manner, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_10765010": "But you were never THIS polite before. It feels like a bit too much...",
  "str_quest_chat_10765011": "Sigh, it's because our performance reviews are coming up...",
  "str_quest_chat_10765012": "So if anyone asks you about my level of service, you better give me full marks!",
  "str_quest_chat_10765013": "Otherwise, there's no telling when I'll get a promotion...",
  "str_quest_chat_10766001": "Getting ready to go on break, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_10766002": "Yep!",
  "str_quest_chat_10766003": "Think you can help me with a small favor first?",
  "str_quest_chat_10766004": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_10766005": "W-Well, it's just that I wanted to ask you something...",
  "str_quest_chat_10766006": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_10766007": "I-I want to ask for the day off!",
  "str_quest_chat_10766008": "S-So I was wondering... Could you tell my boss that I'm out sick today and getting my rest over here?",
  "str_quest_chat_10766009": "Huh? You're not feeling well? Hang on, I'll go check on you right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_10766010": "N-No need, PlayerName! I'll feel loads better once you help me ask for the day off, I promise!",
  "str_quest_chat_10766011": "Pepi, you're not just trying to skip work, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_10766012": "No way! It's just that whenever I even think about delivering that blonde lady's mail, I start shaking all over.",
  "str_quest_chat_10766013": "T-That counts as feeling sick, right?!",
  "str_quest_chat_10851001": "$#%! Wrong button! Er...",
  "str_quest_chat_10851002": "Well guess it wouldn't hurt to say hi to the Navigator now.",
  "str_quest_chat_10851003": "Good afternoon Navigator have you eaten lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_10851004": "I tried the food on a Colossus before and it's honestly not bad!",
  "str_quest_chat_10851005": "Wait... Unimet? Is it really you?",
  "str_quest_chat_10851006": "Who else would it be or have you already forgotten about me?",
  "str_quest_chat_10851007": "It's just... You usually don't talk this fast.",
  "str_quest_chat_10851008": "I'm not much of a talker but I can type pretty fast!",
  "str_quest_chat_10851009": "Pretty fast? You're replying almost instantly!!",
  "str_quest_chat_10851010": "All you're missing is some punctuation in your messages...",
  "str_quest_chat_10851011": "Thanks for the advice, Navigator. I'll try my best from now on!",
  "str_quest_chat_10862001": "Hey... I... good, good afternoon!!",
  "str_quest_chat_10862002": "Good afternoon, Unimet!",
  "str_quest_chat_10862003": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_10862004": "No... not yet!",
  "str_quest_chat_10862005": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_10862006": "Who has time for food when there's a model of the Other End in front of me?",
  "str_quest_chat_10862007": "... I get where you're coming from, but you should still eat something to keep your energy up.",
  "str_quest_chat_10862008": "Wow, can there be a more majestic train?",
  "str_quest_chat_10862009": "... I'm not getting through to you, am I?",
  "str_quest_chat_10881001": "Hey... Are you ever bored, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_10881002": "Not recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_10881003": "Sometimes...",
  "str_quest_chat_10881004": "So... What do you do when you're bored?",
  "str_quest_chat_10881005": "Read, think... stuff like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_10881006": "What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_10881007": "Play rock-paper-scissors with my mechanical hand...",
  "str_quest_chat_10881008": "It uh... can play rock-paper-scissors?",
  "str_quest_chat_10881009": "Well really, it's just me against myself...",
  "str_quest_chat_10882001": "Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_10882002": "Oh, good evening, Unimet.",
  "str_quest_chat_10882003": "Good eve... evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_10882004": "The Col... Colossus is just too cool!",
  "str_quest_chat_10882005": "I... I studied it for a whole day and sti... still couldn't quite understand it.",
  "str_quest_chat_10882006": "No rush, you've got all the time in the world.",
  "str_quest_chat_10882007": "Just remember to eat and sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_10882008": "Since y-you're the owner, you must know how your Colossus works, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_10882009": "Well, despite having been living on Soroz for such a long time...",
  "str_quest_chat_10882010": "I still don't know how everything works.",
  "str_quest_chat_10882011": "Not to mention, what we have is more like a student-teacher relationship... or perhaps family.",
  "str_quest_chat_10882012": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_10882013": "I suppose I must do more research.",
  "str_quest_chat_10951001": "Morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_10951002": "Were you awake early enough to see the light of dawn?",
  "str_quest_chat_10951003": "It's always so beautiful, whether I see it from atop the Colossus or from inside the forest...",
  "str_quest_chat_10951004": "The view is somewhat different, but both are wonderful to look at.",
  "str_quest_chat_10951005": "I just woke up... Can I still see it right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_10951006": "The time has already passed...",
  "str_quest_chat_10951007": "I never took you for the type to sleep in...",
  "str_quest_chat_10951008": "Next time, I will wake you up before the sun rises so that you can see it, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_10951009": "Thanks, but won't that be a little too... early?",
  "str_quest_chat_10952001": "Dew often condenses on leaves in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_10952002": "The way it glistens in sunlight is very pretty.",
  "str_quest_chat_10952003": "Just like the stars?",
  "str_quest_chat_10952004": "Yes. Have you seen it too?",
  "str_quest_chat_10952005": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_10952006": "But I don't see it often since I tend to get up late...",
  "str_quest_chat_10953001": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_10953002": "Morning, Sylva! Need something?",
  "str_quest_chat_10953003": "I went for a walk through the forest earlier today. The wildflowers in the dawn's early light were breathtaking.",
  "str_quest_chat_10953004": "I picked a few and left them at your doorstep.",
  "str_quest_chat_10953005": "This way, you can also enjoy the wonders of the forest dawn without waking up early.",
  "str_quest_chat_10953006": "Wow, thanks, Sylva!",
  "str_quest_chat_10953007": "How thoughtful of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_10953008": "Naturally, if you don't like them, you can always tell me...",
  "str_quest_chat_10953009": "No, I really like them! Honest!",
  "str_quest_chat_10953010": "I had no idea you would like them so much...",
  "str_quest_chat_10953011": "It's settled, then. I'll wake you up at 3:00 A.M. tomorrow for a spirited stroll through the forest!",
  "str_quest_chat_10953012": "T-That's a little too early for me...",
  "str_quest_chat_10961001": "Would you care to have lunch together?",
  "str_quest_chat_10961002": "Thanks for the offer, Sylva...",
  "str_quest_chat_10961003": "But I actually just finished eating... Sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat_10961004": "It's perfectly fine. I... simply asked you too late, is all.",
  "str_quest_chat_10961005": "It's just that... Today's ingredients are looking so fresh.",
  "str_quest_chat_10961006": "It reminds me... of the days I spent foraging for food in the forest.",
  "str_quest_chat_10961007": "Even though I have no idea what you ate back then...",
  "str_quest_chat_10961008": "It still sounds delicious...",
  "str_quest_chat_10961009": "Indeed. Even if I had no way of cooking any of the ingredients I gathered...",
  "str_quest_chat_10961010": "They tasted so fresh and sweet, all the same.",
  "str_quest_chat_10961011": "Just hearing about it is making me hungry again...",
  "str_quest_chat_10962001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_10962002": "It's such a lovely day. Not only is the air humid, but the temperature's also perfect.",
  "str_quest_chat_10962003": "Even if we were to head out now, we won't feel the sun glaring down on us.",
  "str_quest_chat_10962004": "That's right, the weather's indeed lovely.",
  "str_quest_chat_10962005": "But I just want to stay in bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_10962006": "Fiddle around with my Terminal, or just... take a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_10962007": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_10962008": "Eh? Don't tell me that you've plans to travel, Sylva?",
  "str_quest_chat_10962009": "Come on, tell me!",
  "str_quest_chat_10962010": "I'll do my best to help!",
  "str_quest_chat_10962011": "That's okay, Navigator. Just live the way you like.",
  "str_quest_chat_10962012": "You don't have to change your plans on such short notice for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_10962013": "I wish you a lovely afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_10963001": "Witnessing the bloom of a magnificent flower...",
  "str_quest_chat_10963002": "I can't think of a better way to spend a morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_10963003": "It sounds wonderful.",
  "str_quest_chat_10963004": "Afternoon, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_10963005": "Perhaps you'd like to spend the morning with me next time?",
  "str_quest_chat_10963006": "It should be fine...",
  "str_quest_chat_10963007": "Definitely! If I'm able to wake up that early, that is!",
  "str_quest_chat_10964001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_10964002": "Leah is gone today, so I ate lunch by myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_10964003": "It seems that food just doesn't taste the same when you eat alone.",
  "str_quest_chat_10964004": "You could always come to have lunch with me, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_10964005": "Really...? But don't we have to be friends to have lunch together?",
  "str_quest_chat_10964006": "What're you talking about, Sylva? You're my friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_10964007": "Navigator... Is that really true?",
  "str_quest_chat_10964008": "Of course! I wouldn't let you stay on the Colossus if you weren't, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_10964009": "I see... I'll come to have lunch with you the next chance I have, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_10964010": "Should I bring a gift? Perhaps I should go to the forest and have a look around.",
  "str_quest_chat_10964011": "Y-You really don't have to...",
  "str_quest_chat_10965001": "Are you resting right now, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_10965002": "Not yet, why?",
  "str_quest_chat_10965003": "I... would like your opinion on something, if possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_10965004": "My opinion? Sure, what is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_10965005": "Do you think I should cut my hair even shorter?",
  "str_quest_chat_10965006": "But it looks fine the way it is right now, doesn't it? Why would you want to cut it off?",
  "str_quest_chat_10965007": "Well, other people often mistake me for a girl...",
  "str_quest_chat_10965008": "So I thought maybe... Maybe it's because my hair is too long, that it covers my face.",
  "str_quest_chat_10965009": "I think...",
  "str_quest_chat_10965010": "Leave it long!",
  "str_quest_chat_10965011": "You like your current hairstyle, don't you Sylva? It's why you haven't changed it.",
  "str_quest_chat_10965012": "If people keep mistaking you for a girl, just correct them and be on your way.",
  "str_quest_chat_10965013": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_10965014": "I'm still uncomfortable talking to strangers, but I'll try that next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_10965015": "Snip away!",
  "str_quest_chat_10965016": "If you really want to cut it short, it wouldn't hurt to try out a new hairstyle, Sylva!",
  "str_quest_chat_10965017": "Though I think whether you cut your hair has nothing to do with how others see you.",
  "str_quest_chat_10965018": "Besides, you shouldn't doubt yourself based on other people's opinions of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_10965019": "I see... You're right, Navigator. I understand now!",
  "str_quest_chat_10965020": "Thank you for sharing your thoughts!",
  "str_quest_chat_11001999": "Vice has something urgent to talk to you about. Go to the Bridge now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11051001": "Greetings, and good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_11051002": "Good morning, Lester! You seem full of energy today!",
  "str_quest_chat_11051003": "Not really, I was just showing politeness.",
  "str_quest_chat_11051004": "Oh, is that so...",
  "str_quest_chat_11051005": "Of course it is! Say, don't you think it's way too bright inside your Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_11051006": "I had to use all of my stuff to block the window, just so I could create some semblance of dark around here!",
  "str_quest_chat_11051007": "Oh... Have you been having trouble sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_11051008": "That's right! I only managed to get a few winks of sleep after all that trouble. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to try and get a few more...",
  "str_quest_chat_11051009": "O-Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_11052001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_11052002": "Any plans for such early hours?",
  "str_quest_chat_11052003": "I'm on my way to get breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_11052004": "Would you like to join me?",
  "str_quest_chat_11052005": "What a coincidence. I guess I shall.",
  "str_quest_chat_11053001": "A day's plan starts with the dawn.",
  "str_quest_chat_11053002": "Morning, Lester!",
  "str_quest_chat_11053003": "You're up awfully early today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11053004": "I could say the same about you!",
  "str_quest_chat_11053005": "Hah! Don't start comparing us now!",
  "str_quest_chat_11053006": "When it comes to waking up early, I don't get a choice sometimes. Comes with being middle-aged...",
  "str_quest_chat_11053007": "Sleeping in is for the young'uns!",
  "str_quest_chat_11053008": "R-Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_11053009": "A day's plan starts with the dawn, and a life's plan starts with... being young!",
  "str_quest_chat_11053010": "But enough of that! It's time for me to get a little exercise!",
  "str_quest_chat_11053011": "Guess what happens to these old bones of mine if I don't?",
  "str_quest_chat_11053012": "What happens?",
  "str_quest_chat_11053013": "Believe it or not—they start to rust! Hahaha!",
  "str_quest_chat_11061001": "Have you eaten anything for lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_11061002": "Yeah, I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_11061003": "You know, from where I come. When we ask someone if they've eaten yet, we aren't just asking about your meal...",
  "str_quest_chat_11061004": "Th-Then how should I respond...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11061005": "On top of telling me whether you've eaten, you're also supposed to tell me what you're up to.",
  "str_quest_chat_11061006": "Oh... I was just about to go lie down for a bit...",
  "str_quest_chat_11061007": "I-Is that good enough of a response for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11061008": "Oho? You catch on pretty quickly!",
  "str_quest_chat_11061009": "Very well, then! Get plenty of rest, I'll beat it now!",
  "str_quest_chat_11061010": "...Oh, I get it. You're saying goodbye, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_11062001": "Good afternoon, sir.",
  "str_quest_chat_11062002": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_11062003": "I'll go first this time. Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_11062004": "Not yet. Shall we grab some lunch together?",
  "str_quest_chat_11062005": "Sure, I've not eaten either.",
  "str_quest_chat_11062006": "I wonder what's for lunch today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11062007": "I just happened to see the menu when I passed by the cafe this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_11062008": "We'll be having Cloud Island cuisine for lunch today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11062009": "There'll also be tea and snacks in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11062010": "Come on, let's get going!",
  "str_quest_chat_11062011": "There won't be anything left if we are late!",
  "str_quest_chat_11062012": "All right, let's go!",
  "str_quest_chat_11063001": "You eat yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_11063002": "Yeah, I just had breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_11063003": "What? It's nearly noon, and you just ate breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_11063004": "A late meal like this has to last you till dinner, so I hope you ate a little extra!",
  "str_quest_chat_11063005": "I just had lunch, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_11063006": "Oh? So you ate lunch at a reasonable time today, eh?",
  "str_quest_chat_11063007": "Today should be a good day for you then!",
  "str_quest_chat_11063008": "What about you, Lester? Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_11063009": "Do you even have to ask? In fact, I ate through all my stores of food!",
  "str_quest_chat_11063010": "Looks like I'll have to go foraging in the mountains soon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11063011": "I have plenty of food here, Lester. You're welcome to have anything you like.",
  "str_quest_chat_11063012": "Ah, I'll pass, I'm not a fan of much else besides wild fruit.",
  "str_quest_chat_11063013": "Still, thanks for the kind offer!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081001": "Good evening, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081002": "Can you help me with something?",
  "str_quest_chat_11081003": "Good evening, Lester. What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11081004": "It's like this, Navigator. If I'm able to do a job for a Caelestite, the folks back home will probably think I'm famous or something!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081005": "I will have a steady flow of jobs in line, then! Plenty of good and safe ones, too! So that I can earn the pay without risking too much!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081006": "Er... Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_11081007": "So how can I help?",
  "str_quest_chat_11081008": "Maybe some other time?",
  "str_quest_chat_11081009": "I... Don't really have any jobs for other people to do right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11081010": "Aw, c'mon! Don't turn me down, please!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081011": "Look, it's really easy! Just take one of the bottles on my tail, and that's it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081012": "Uh... Okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_11081013": "So you agree to it? Great, I'll deliver this right away!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081014": "Sure, I'll just wait for you to deliver it before I go to bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_11081015": "...Lester?",
  "str_quest_chat_11081016": "Where'd you go? Don't tell me you fell asleep?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081017": "Uh-oh... Had an accident, sorry! I'll deliver it to you next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081018": "What's going on...? This smell?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081019": "Wh-What is this awful stench?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081020": "It looks like... the smell is coming from your room!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081021": "It's fine, it's fine! I just sort of... Knocked this thing over, that's all!",
  "str_quest_chat_11081022": "Urgh... I think I'm about to pass out...",
  "str_quest_chat_11081023": "Huh? Pass out? Oh don't worry, it isn't lethal or anything. You'll wake up in a day or so!",
  "str_quest_chat_11082001": "Good evening, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_11082002": "Good evening, Lester.",
  "str_quest_chat_11082003": "I heard you keep a diary out of habit?",
  "str_quest_chat_11082004": "Yes. I'm writing in it right now, as a matter of fact.",
  "str_quest_chat_11082005": "Though I wouldn't call it a habit.",
  "str_quest_chat_11082006": "I only write down the interesting things.",
  "str_quest_chat_11082007": "That's nice.",
  "str_quest_chat_11082008": "It's never easy to keep up with a habit for years.",
  "str_quest_chat_11082009": "Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_11082010": "I'm going to let you go, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_11082011": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_11082012": "Good night, Lester.",
  "str_quest_chat_11083001": "Good evening, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_11083002": "Don't you feel like there are too many people on the Colossus at times?",
  "str_quest_chat_11083003": "Don't you feel it's pretty hectic around here?",
  "str_quest_chat_11083004": "Not at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_11083005": "I actually like having lots of people on board. Keeps things lively.",
  "str_quest_chat_11083006": "Maybe a little...",
  "str_quest_chat_11083007": "But I'm used to it, honestly.",
  "str_quest_chat_11083008": "Sigh... Gotta say, I admire you sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat_11083009": "If I had a big, hulking Colossus like this, I wouldn't let anyone on board to bother me. It'd be like my big, quiet sanctuary!",
  "str_quest_chat_11083010": "So you prefer peace and quiet, huh, Lester?",
  "str_quest_chat_11083011": "I never would've guessed...",
  "str_quest_chat_11083012": "How many times do I gotta tell you? You can't judge a woman by her looks.",
  "str_quest_chat_11083013": "You still got a lot to learn, eh?",
  "str_quest_chat_11083014": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_11101001": "There are some questions I'd like to ask you about that assessment report you provided to Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat_11101002": "Go ahead.",
  "str_quest_chat_11101003": "Why did you give yourself the lowest rating on your combat assessment?",
  "str_quest_chat_11101004": "Because I don't really have any combat power.",
  "str_quest_chat_11101005": "Also, under 'Recent Problems', you wrote 'Having trouble sleeping'?",
  "str_quest_chat_11101006": "Yes, it's pretty common...I'll feel really tired.",
  "str_quest_chat_11101007": "Understood. When you're free, come for me at the <color=#FFB400>Bridge</color>. Best if it's now. Immediately. Right away.",
  "str_quest_chat_11101008": "Urgh...That busy?",
  "str_quest_chat_11101999": "Sharona really emphasized on me meeting her at the Bridge now, immediately, and at once. It could be disastrous if I'm late.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105001": "PlayerName, are you still writing that assessment report?",
  "str_quest_chat_11105002": "Um... Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105003": "You sound a little reluctant. Is there a problem?",
  "str_quest_chat_11105004": "Um... I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105005": "Oh? Am I really asking for too much? There's no rush.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105006": "I'm okay. I think I'll be able to finish it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105007": "Really? There's no rush. The assessment report can be very hard to write.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105008": "In that case, can I submit the assessment report to you a few days late?",
  "str_quest_chat_11105009": "Of course not!",
  "str_quest_chat_11105010": "This is work, and work must be completed on time. You were the one who agreed to this.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105011": "I didn't know it was this difficult to write back then.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105012": "Ah... Maybe you really aren't that familiar with it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105013": "I'll help you then.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105014": "Really? Thank you so much! I'll buy you a gift later!",
  "str_quest_chat_11105015": "Y-you don't need to!",
  "str_quest_chat_11105016": "You don't need to give me a gift or anything. It's my duty to help my subordinates.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105017": "Alright then.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105018": "But I still need to thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11105019": "No need—just finish that assessment report as soon as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_11141001": "I've had my eye on you for a while... Nice to finally meet you!",
  "str_quest_chat_11141002": "I'm sure you've never met an Aurorian like me, right? Well, I've never met a Caelestite, either!",
  "str_quest_chat_11141003": "So? Care for a match?",
  "str_quest_chat_11141004": "I-I'm sorry?",
  "str_quest_chat_11141005": "We just met... and you want to fight me?",
  "str_quest_chat_11141006": "If you want to call it \"fighting\", then yes. Let's fight!",
  "str_quest_chat_11141007": "S-Sure, but... I'm not much of a fighter.",
  "str_quest_chat_11141008": "Oh? Doubting your own strength already?",
  "str_quest_chat_11141009": "That's fine, too! Nothing one of my training plans can't fix!",
  "str_quest_chat_11141010": "Training... Plans...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11141011": "That's right! I'll be your personal combat instructor and you will learn how to harness your power!",
  "str_quest_chat_11141012": "B-But... That's never been a big goal for me...",
  "str_quest_chat_11141013": "It's decided! I'll see you in my room tomorrow morning at six o'clock sharp!",
  "str_quest_chat_11141014": "Any chance we can reschedule?...",
  "str_quest_chat_11142001": "I can sense a vast, hidden potential within me...",
  "str_quest_chat_11142002": "The potential is so great that it makes my blood boil!",
  "str_quest_chat_11142003": "It's almost unbearable, this feeling...",
  "str_quest_chat_11142004": "Don't tell me you want a rematch...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11142005": "My comrade in battle... Help me relieve this rage burning in my chest!",
  "str_quest_chat_11142006": "I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11142007": "No really, I'm not a fighter at all... I'm sorry, but I can't help...",
  "str_quest_chat_11142008": "But if you want to let off some steam, Sharona...",
  "str_quest_chat_11142009": "Why don't we go play in the rec room for a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_11142010": "These \"toys\" aren't enough to take out my anger!",
  "str_quest_chat_11142011": "I see... I guess the games in the rec room aren't enough for Sharona...",
  "str_quest_chat_11142012": "How about we go to the cafe?",
  "str_quest_chat_11142013": "I'm sure a nice, hot cup of coffee will help you unwind!",
  "str_quest_chat_11142014": "However, a true soldier doesn't have the time or the need to slack off like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_11142015": "Hmm... Hey! What about the Workshop?",
  "str_quest_chat_11142016": "I'm sure you could let off some steam there, Sharona!",
  "str_quest_chat_11142017": "Hmm, not a bad idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_11142018": "Thanks for the suggestion. I think I'll go there right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_11142019": "Whew... Crisis averted.",
  "str_quest_chat_11151001": "The sun is out!",
  "str_quest_chat_11151002": "... Hmm? Urgh! What's happening!",
  "str_quest_chat_11151003": "Time to get up for a jog!",
  "str_quest_chat_11151004": "Huh?! What's happening?",
  "str_quest_chat_11151005": "I thought you wanted me to wake you up?",
  "str_quest_chat_11152001": "Are you free later on?",
  "str_quest_chat_11152002": "I guess so... What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_11152003": "I need your help with something.",
  "str_quest_chat_11152004": "There's actually something I can help you with?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11152005": "Anyone will do for heavy lifting.",
  "str_quest_chat_11152006": "OK...",
  "str_quest_chat_11153001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_11153002": "Good morning, Sharona!",
  "str_quest_chat_11153003": "Hmm...? You seem to be in unusually high spirits today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11153004": "Erm, well... I heard they're cooking my favorite breakfast today...",
  "str_quest_chat_11153005": "That's it? In that case, I shouldn't hold you to the same standards as the Grand Marshal.",
  "str_quest_chat_11153006": "... A good breakfast is a great way to start a day of intense training!",
  "str_quest_chat_11153007": "Sounds like nonsense, but I will not dwell on this matter any further.",
  "str_quest_chat_11154001": "It's time to get up!",
  "str_quest_chat_11154002": "It's not time for me to get up yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_11154003": "As long as I'm here, it's my responsibility to oversee your work and your rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_11154004": "Just... five more minutes...",
  "str_quest_chat_11154005": "Oh, sure you can. I'll just have to double today's training quota.",
  "str_quest_chat_11154006": "No, no, no! I'll get up! See?! I'm up already!",
  "str_quest_chat_11154007": "That's more like it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11155001": "How much do you know about weapon maintenance?",
  "str_quest_chat_11155002": "Not much...",
  "str_quest_chat_11155003": "Vice talked about it once...",
  "str_quest_chat_11155004": "Oh?",
  "str_quest_chat_11155005": "Only a few things, I can't remember much.",
  "str_quest_chat_11155006": "The Caelestites really aren't a very combat-oriented species.",
  "str_quest_chat_11155007": "Even cold weapons must be maintained in different ways. For example...",
  "str_quest_chat_11155008": "Barton's blade and mine must be maintained in different manners.",
  "str_quest_chat_11155009": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_11155010": "I'll tell you about it when we get the chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_11156001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_11156002": "Are you here for a morning stretch?",
  "str_quest_chat_11156003": "I, I...",
  "str_quest_chat_11156004": "How about tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat_11156005": "Can I say no?",
  "str_quest_chat_11156006": "Figured you were going to say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_11156007": "Still, I suggest you train your body as much as possible while you're still young.",
  "str_quest_chat_11156008": "You will feel the benefits of training in the following decades.",
  "str_quest_chat_11156009": "Roger! I'll keep that in mind, Commander Sharona!",
  "str_quest_chat_11156010": "I'd prefer not to remember you as a slacker like that lazy cat, understand?",
  "str_quest_chat_11156011": "Yes, ma'am!",
  "str_quest_chat_11157001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_11157002": "Good morning, Commander Sharona.",
  "str_quest_chat_11157003": "On your way to do your morning exercises again?",
  "str_quest_chat_11157004": "That's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_11157005": "Exercise requires constant discipline. There can be no days off.",
  "str_quest_chat_11158001": "Now, my comrade in battle.",
  "str_quest_chat_11158002": "Could I ask you to forbid horseplay in the Colossus corridor?",
  "str_quest_chat_11158003": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_11158004": "There were two kids playing in there just now. One of them stepped on my tail.",
  "str_quest_chat_11158005": "I did think of reminding them of the rules.",
  "str_quest_chat_11158006": "But they took one look at me and fled in tears.",
  "str_quest_chat_11158007": "That's not great. I'll be sure to remind everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat_11158008": "Although I'm not sure if the kids will pay any attention...",
  "str_quest_chat_11161001": "It's noon already. Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_11161002": "Good afternoon! Erm... Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_11161003": "I think I may have eaten too much this morning... I'm not really feeling hungry right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11161004": "Hmm? You're not hungry?",
  "str_quest_chat_11161005": "Has this ever happened to you before? If so, how long does it usually last, and do you need a doctor?",
  "str_quest_chat_11161006": "As we are already on the Colossus, there's no need to contact any external organizations.",
  "str_quest_chat_11161007": "Erm... Thanks, but... I think I'll be alright.",
  "str_quest_chat_11161008": "I'm fine, Sharona! Don't worry about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11161009": "Basically, I just... erm...",
  "str_quest_chat_11161010": "I just ate too much for breakfast...",
  "str_quest_chat_11161011": "Well then, I suggest you eat something easily digestible this afternoon, paired with some light exercise.",
  "str_quest_chat_11161012": "Jogging, or even walking, is better than doing nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_11161013": "Please take action immediately, instantly, promptly—",
  "str_quest_chat_11161014": "Right! Got it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11161015": "So, this is how a Legion Commander commands her troops...",
  "str_quest_chat_11162001": "Lunch break is over. Wake up!",
  "str_quest_chat_11162002": "I'm awake, I'm awake...",
  "str_quest_chat_11162003": "I suggest you get up ten minutes earlier tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_11162004": "That way, I won't have to look at that pathetically sleepy expression when we're about to start training.",
  "str_quest_chat_11162005": "Looking upon your previous training records, I've prepared you a cup of triple-espresso.",
  "str_quest_chat_11162006": "The Fireflies are already on their way to your room. Drink it up and come for your training session.",
  "str_quest_chat_11162007": "Alright. Thank you...",
  "str_quest_chat_11162008": "What a stringently thoughtful person...",
  "str_quest_chat_11163001": "How long do you think a noontime nap should be?",
  "str_quest_chat_11163002": "Long enough to wake up by natural?",
  "str_quest_chat_11163003": "Not sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_11163004": "Ah... Caelestites really aren't cut out for the military...",
  "str_quest_chat_11163005": "In the military, we have strict schedules for everything, including breaks.",
  "str_quest_chat_11163006": "That strict...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11163007": "How else can you be a good soldier?",
  "str_quest_chat_11163008": "Impressive.",
  "str_quest_chat_11164001": "I heard you had an extra helping at lunch today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11164002": "I did...",
  "str_quest_chat_11164003": "I was tired from my morning workout and couldn't help myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_11164004": "Is that bad for the fitness routine?",
  "str_quest_chat_11164005": "Overeating can make exercise harder.",
  "str_quest_chat_11164006": "But there's nothing wrong with some supplementary nutrition.",
  "str_quest_chat_11164007": "Is it bad for health?",
  "str_quest_chat_11164008": "No, not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_11164009": "I didn't mean to criticize you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11164010": "It's just a habit of mine to care for the soldiers I train.",
  "str_quest_chat_11164011": "T-Thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_11201001": "PlayerName, can I ask if there's something like a library on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_11201002": "Nope. You want to read some books...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11201003": "Ah, no.",
  "str_quest_chat_11201004": "Your friend wants to read some books? No, you told me that the Lumopolis has lots of them.",
  "str_quest_chat_11201005": "Ah, it's not to read. It's something else.",
  "str_quest_chat_11201006": "Angel... You're being kind of mysterious today. Is there anything you want to tell me? Shall we find a place to talk?",
  "str_quest_chat_11201007": "Okay PlayerName, I'll be waiting for you at the <color=#FFB400>Prism Pillar</color>.",
  "str_quest_chat_11201999": "Angel is waiting for you at the Prism Pillar. Don't be late.",
  "str_quest_chat_11202001": "PlayerName, what do you think of Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_11202002": "Lumopolis... is very beautiful.",
  "str_quest_chat_11202003": "Really? It seems like I've gradually forgotten about how beautiful it is here because I've always been living here...",
  "str_quest_chat_11202004": "Lumopolis... is very safe.",
  "str_quest_chat_11202005": "Really? As one of Lumopolis, I feel happy to hear you a Caelestite outsider say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_11202006": "No matter what others think, Lumopolis is like a home to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_11202007": "It's my duty to protect this home that basks under the grace of the god of light.",
  "str_quest_chat_11202008": "Although PlayerName always lives in the Colossus, I hope PlayerName will also see Lumopolis as home one day.",
  "str_quest_chat_11202009": "It'll be... a home that I share with PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_11261001": "Good afternoon. Are you free in the afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_11261002": "Yup, I guess I am pretty free.",
  "str_quest_chat_11261003": "I'm lost.",
  "str_quest_chat_11261004": "Where are you? I'll go get you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11261005": "... I don't know.",
  "str_quest_chat_11261006": "What can I do then? Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_11262001": "It's perfect weather for training today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11262002": "Yes, there's so much sunlight.",
  "str_quest_chat_11262003": "The air is really fresh too. It's a perfect day for a stroll.",
  "str_quest_chat_11262004": "Yep.",
  "str_quest_chat_11262005": "When are you ever going to invite me to go on a stroll with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11262006": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11263001": "Good afternoon. Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_11263002": "I'm having lunch now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11263003": "Good. I won't bother you, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_11263004": "Uh... Can I help you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11263005": "It's nothing. I just wanted to make sure you'd eaten.",
  "str_quest_chat_11263006": "It's not like I wanted to... It was the will of the heavens!",
  "str_quest_chat_11263007": "...Sure, that's very thoughtful of the heavens.",
  "str_quest_chat_11264001": "I feel... the Colossus is really amazing.",
  "str_quest_chat_11264002": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_11264003": "A giant construct... with its own consciousness...",
  "str_quest_chat_11264004": "Who created it? And why?",
  "str_quest_chat_11264005": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_11264006": "Don't you find it strange? Or, have you never thought about it...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11264007": "Not really... It's not like there's a definite answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_11264008": "That's true. Finding an answer to this question won't be an easy task.",
  "str_quest_chat_11265001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11265002": "Good afternoon, Angel!",
  "str_quest_chat_11265003": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_11265004": "No, I have to hurry up and get all these files sorted...",
  "str_quest_chat_11265005": "Eh? Do you have to do that on your lunch break?",
  "str_quest_chat_11265006": "Lady Irridon complimented me this morning... saying that I did a good job sorting the court files.",
  "str_quest_chat_11265007": "So I can't slack off! I need to use this time to check everything we'll be needing for this afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_11265008": "Wow, that's very diligent of you!",
  "str_quest_chat_11265009": "But take care of yourself and remember to eat lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_11265010": "Yeah, I'll have a sandwich later.",
  "str_quest_chat_11265011": "Got to go. See you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11265012": "Goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat_11266001": "What do you usually do on your lunch break, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_11266002": "Nap, usually.",
  "str_quest_chat_11266003": "I get sleepy when it's noon time!",
  "str_quest_chat_11266004": "Read a book, usually.",
  "str_quest_chat_11266005": "Reading during break is a form of relaxation as well!",
  "str_quest_chat_11266006": "Is that so...",
  "str_quest_chat_11266007": "A-Anything wrong with that?",
  "str_quest_chat_11266008": "No, just asking.",
  "str_quest_chat_11266009": "You have a good afternoon. I've got to run.",
  "str_quest_chat_11266010": "All right, good afternoon to you too.",
  "str_quest_chat_11301001": "PlayerName, you awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_11301002": "Of course! I'm not you!",
  "str_quest_chat_11301003": "Ah... Navigator, what do you mean by that... Anyway, I need to talk to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11301004": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11301005": "It's regarding the Colossus Room, that you're the expert on.",
  "str_quest_chat_11301006": "Fine... You rarely take the initiative... Where are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11301007": "Obviously at the <color=#FFB400>lounge</color>!",
  "str_quest_chat_11301999": "Dove actually wants to talk to you about something. Go to the lounge now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11302001": "Coocoo, PlayerName, do you want to Coocoo with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_11302002": "What's Coocoo?",
  "str_quest_chat_11302003": "Coocoo is Coocoo.",
  "str_quest_chat_11302004": "I still don't understand...",
  "str_quest_chat_11302005": "Fine, PlayerName, I'll give you an example.",
  "str_quest_chat_11302006": "For example, if I ask PlayerName out to have some fun at a park in Lumopolis, and PlayerName agrees without any hesitation!",
  "str_quest_chat_11302007": "Oh? Have I already agreed to it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11302008": "You will! You will, right?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11302009": "... I guess I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_11302010": "Yes! And then when it's the agreed time, PlayerName and I will appear together at...",
  "str_quest_chat_11302011": "The agreed place?",
  "str_quest_chat_11302012": "Inside the Soroz!",
  "str_quest_chat_11302013": "Doesn't that mean neither person went?",
  "str_quest_chat_11302014": "That's what Coocoo means!",
  "str_quest_chat_11302015": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_11302016": "Also, if it's like this, we can live happily together inside the Soroz and go Coocoo!",
  "str_quest_chat_11302017": "I think I understand, but not exactly...",
  "str_quest_chat_11302018": "It's okay, you just need to go Coocoo with me. Coocoo Coocoo!",
  "str_quest_chat_11302019": "Coocoo!",
  "str_quest_chat_11351001": "Yawn... I'm up so early today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11351002": "It's almost 10am!",
  "str_quest_chat_11351003": "Huh? Is it almost 10am?",
  "str_quest_chat_11351004": "Don't you have work to do in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_11351005": "I do, but... I'm sleepy, so I'll worry about it in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11351006": "... Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_11352001": "Oh... Did I promise PlayerName to do\nsomething today?",
  "str_quest_chat_11352002": "I've been waiting on the bridge for two hours.",
  "str_quest_chat_11352003": "Ahaha, I overslept... Hehe.",
  "str_quest_chat_11352004": "How dare you laugh!",
  "str_quest_chat_11352005": "... Should we give it a pass today? N-next time for sure! Coocoo!",
  "str_quest_chat_11353001": "Coo coo, good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_11353002": "Morning, Dove.",

  "str_quest_chat_11353005": "Why aren't you speaking?",
  "str_quest_chat_11353006": "Don't tell me...",
  "str_quest_chat_11353007": "Coo! That's enough!",
  "str_quest_chat_11353008": "I slept the whole day yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat_11353009": "I just got up...",
  "str_quest_chat_11353010": "No wonder!",
  "str_quest_chat_11354001": "I can't believe that I actually woke up on time today!",
  "str_quest_chat_11354002": "I'm having a hard time believing it too, Dove!",
  "str_quest_chat_11354003": "Do you have work today or something?",
  "str_quest_chat_11354004": "Nope, I'm off today!",
  "str_quest_chat_11354005": "Uh... Doesn't that mean you can sleep a little more today?",
  "str_quest_chat_11354006": "Don't you get it, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_11354007": "The reason I'm up early today is because it's my day off!",
  "str_quest_chat_11354008": "I-I don't get it...",
  "str_quest_chat_11354009": "See, the earlier I wake up on my day off, the more time I have to play!",
  "str_quest_chat_11354010": "If I do that on my work days, I just end up working longer.",
  "str_quest_chat_11354011": "But don't tell anyone I said that! Got it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11355001": "Coo, coo! Mails for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_11355002": "You're working early today, aren't you, Dove?",
  "str_quest_chat_11355003": "It's all because you're so popular. All of these letters are for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_11355004": "Heheh, thanks for all your hard work.",
  "str_quest_chat_11355005": "I'm in my room, you can deliver them whenever you have the chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_11355006": "Huh? Can't you send your Fireflies to pick them up?",
  "str_quest_chat_11355007": "I still have some sleep to catch up on!",
  "str_quest_chat_11355008": "Huh...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11355009": "And tell the Fireflies to keep it down. A girl needs her beauty sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_11355010": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_11355011": "Oh, and remember to give me a good rating, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_11361001": "Coo... Coo, coo.",
  "str_quest_chat_11361002": "Good afternoon, Dove.",
  "str_quest_chat_11361003": "Goof afternoon... Erm...",
  "str_quest_chat_11361004": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_11361005": "This afternoon's training... I don't have to go, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_11361006": "Well, my aunt's cousin's wife's sister is sick, and I have to go look after her!",
  "str_quest_chat_11361007": "So... Basically, I'm on leave, not absence, coo-coo...",
  "str_quest_chat_11361008": "Alright, but there's no training today...",
  "str_quest_chat_11361009": "...Coo!",
  "str_quest_chat_11362001": "Coo coo.",
  "str_quest_chat_11362002": "PlayerName, I had the fireflies send you something.",
  "str_quest_chat_11362003": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_11362004": "Attendance sheets!",
  "str_quest_chat_11362005": "You want me to modify them so you pass them, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_11362006": "Yep!",
  "str_quest_chat_11362007": "... No way.",
  "str_quest_chat_11362008": "Fine. Just this once.",
  "str_quest_chat_11362009": "The attendance sheets should be there soon. Remember to take them!",
  "str_quest_chat_11362010": "I-I didn't get anything?",
  "str_quest_chat_11362011": "But... I had the fireflies send them to you a while ago... Unless...",
  "str_quest_chat_11362012": "Looks like they take after you, coo coo...",
  "str_quest_chat_11362013": "Ahhhh! Nooooo!",
  "str_quest_chat_11363001": "Finally, it's time for a lunch break... Coo...",
  "str_quest_chat_11363002": "Dove? I thought lunch break was a foreign concept to you...",
  "str_quest_chat_11363003": "Since you're taking breaks all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_11363004": "Coo coo!",
  "str_quest_chat_11363005": "You need to sneak around to slack off at work, but you can chill out in the open on a lunch break.",
  "str_quest_chat_11363006": "I can't believe you said that with a straight face.",
  "str_quest_chat_11363007": "Coo, enough talking. I'm going to... hit the sack.",
  "str_quest_chat_11363008": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_11363009": "Good afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_11364001": "Yaaaawn—",
  "str_quest_chat_11364002": "What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_11364003": "I open my eyes to see what time it is, but it's barely noon...",
  "str_quest_chat_11364004": "You didn't just wake up, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11364005": "If only I could sleep all the way until nighttime...",
  "str_quest_chat_11364006": "Why's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_11364007": "It's too dark to see at night, so I don't have to make any deliveries.",
  "str_quest_chat_11364008": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_11364009": "Sigh... Guess I should get up and go to work now, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_11364010": "You'd better!",
  "str_quest_chat_11364011": "Coo, coo! Don't rush me!",
  "str_quest_chat_11364012": "Honestly, PlayerName... You're starting to sound a lot like my boss these days!",
  "str_quest_chat_11364013": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_11365001": "Coo, coo! What's going on with you, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_11365002": "Just getting ready to take a break.",
  "str_quest_chat_11365003": "Huh... really? How boring.",
  "str_quest_chat_11365004": "You don't take breaks or naps during the day, Dove?",
  "str_quest_chat_11365005": "No, wait... You spend most of the day asleep anyway, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_11365006": "Don't worry about the details so much!",
  "str_quest_chat_11365007": "Anyway, my new game just came in! Wanna play?",
  "str_quest_chat_11365008": "Uh... I-I still have work to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_11365009": "Coo, coo. You're no fun anymore, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_11365010": "Wait a minute, don't you have work to do, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_11365011": "What was that? I think something is wrong with this terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat_11365012": "I can't see the words, it's so blurry.",
  "str_quest_chat_11365013": "Playing now... Talk later...!",
  "str_quest_chat_11365014": "... You're just avoiding the question, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11401001": "Hello? You there?",
  "str_quest_chat_11401002": "Zoya?",
  "str_quest_chat_11401003": "Clever. You're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_11401004": "You're looking for me... Did something happen?",
  "str_quest_chat_11401005": "Yup, and you're getting smarter by the day. It's about the room.",
  "str_quest_chat_11401006": "The Room? Do you have something in mind?",
  "str_quest_chat_11401007": "I'll tell you later; it's too bothersome to talk here. I'll see you at the <color=#FFB400>Lumina Grid</color>.",
  "str_quest_chat_11401008": "Zoya! Hello!? Why is she always like this? Gone immediately after conversations.",
  "str_quest_chat_11401999": "Zoya is waiting for you at the Lumina Grid. You should go now or you'll be hearing her snide remarks again.",
  "str_quest_chat_11402001": "PlayerName, I'm inviting you to take part in my experiment.",
  "str_quest_chat_11402002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_11402003": "Yes. For the next 72 hours, you're not allowed to eat, drink, or sleep. You also need to be in a good mood...",
  "str_quest_chat_11402004": "Hold on, 72 hours without all those, and I still need to be in a good mood?",
  "str_quest_chat_11402005": "I haven't even agreed to it yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_11402006": "You won't do it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11402007": "Hey! It wasn't easy for me to become interested in anyone other than Hiiro. That's why I want to study you...",
  "str_quest_chat_11402008": "Fine then, I suppose respecting the wishes of the test subjects is basic ethics. We'll postpone the experiment indefinitely since you aren't willing to participate.",
  "str_quest_chat_11402009": "But you have to tell me immediately if you change your mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_11402010": "I'll make sure to study you thoroughly!",
  "str_quest_chat_11461001": "Hey, it's lunchtime! Planning on eating?",
  "str_quest_chat_11461002": "Is this really Zoya messaging me?",
  "str_quest_chat_11461003": "Stop overthinking things.",
  "str_quest_chat_11461004": "I just thought of you when I was wondering whether Commander Hiiro had eaten on time.",
  "str_quest_chat_11461005": "Erm... Should I be grateful?",
  "str_quest_chat_11461006": "Well, naturally!",
  "str_quest_chat_11462001": "Rumor has it that Umbraton has a kind of good sound-proof material.",
  "str_quest_chat_11462002": "Sound-proof?",
  "str_quest_chat_11462003": "Exactly, I am a researcher. I need a quiet environment.",
  "str_quest_chat_11462004": "Especially on the Colossus. There would always be people making noise in the corridors...",
  "str_quest_chat_11462005": "Just now, someone was running in the corridors right after lunch. It's not like they're kids!",
  "str_quest_chat_11462006": "I'll... pay attention to that.",
  "str_quest_chat_11462007": "No need. Just go buy some sound-proof materials.",
  "str_quest_chat_11462008": "It should cost about a hundred thousand Nightium.",
  "str_quest_chat_11462009": "Ugh... I-I'll think about it...",
  "str_quest_chat_11463001": "Good afternoon. Pardon me, but have you seen Lady Hiiro?",
  "str_quest_chat_11463002": "I haven't.",
  "str_quest_chat_11463003": "I don't think she's been on the Colossus for a while, sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat_11463004": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_11463005": "She went back to Gannon City for an urgent matter.",
  "str_quest_chat_11463006": "What?! Sigh... Another wasted effort...",
  "str_quest_chat_11463007": "If you really want to see her, why not set up a time to meet with one another?",
  "str_quest_chat_11463008": "Y-You mean... like a... date?",
  "str_quest_chat_11463009": "H-How could I possibly do something like that with Lady Hiiro?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11463010": "I just want to bump into her by coincidence, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat_11463011": "... But you wouldn't understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_11464001": "Good afternoon, Colossus homebody.",
  "str_quest_chat_11464002": "I accidentally knocked over a coffee cup in the corridor.",
  "str_quest_chat_11464003": "How should I clean it up?",
  "str_quest_chat_11464004": "Don't worry about it, I'll have the Fireflies take care of the mess.",
  "str_quest_chat_11464005": "No thanks, I would rather do it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_11464006": "That way, I can draft a new thesis on how to properly clean spilled coffee aboard a Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_11464007": "Do you really need to write an essay on cleaning?",
  "str_quest_chat_11464008": "Of course I do. Now tell me how I should proceed.",
  "str_quest_chat_11464009": "The same way you would clean a spilled drink anywhere else, I guess...",
  "str_quest_chat_11464010": "The same way? It seems this doesn't merit any sort of research whatsoever.",
  "str_quest_chat_11464011": "Forget it, just have the Fireflies clean it up then.",
  "str_quest_chat_11464012": "W-Wait, you didn't tell me where the spill is!",
  "str_quest_chat_11481001": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11481002": "??? How rare!",
  "str_quest_chat_11481003": "... Don't misunderstand the situation—Madam Hiiro said that I'll seem more polite like this.",
  "str_quest_chat_11481004": "Does this mean we've gotten closer to one another?",
  "str_quest_chat_11481005": "Dream on.",
  "str_quest_chat_11482001": "Ready for bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_11482002": "Ready.",
  "str_quest_chat_11482003": "You checked in on me only because of Lady Hiiro, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_11482004": "It seems you know your place.",
  "str_quest_chat_11482005": "Thanks... Though that wasn't really a compliment.",
  "str_quest_chat_11482006": "Since that's what you say just about every time...",
  "str_quest_chat_11482007": "Anyway, good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11482008": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11483001": "I have something to ask!",
  "str_quest_chat_11483002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11483003": "Oh, let me guess... You want to know if I've seen Hiiro around lately, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_11483004": "If so, the answer is no.",
  "str_quest_chat_11483005": "Who said you could refer to Lady Hiiro so casually?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11483006": "Besides, Lady Hiiro is very busy! The odds of running into her out of the blue are slim to none!",
  "str_quest_chat_11483007": "So you understand that too, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_11483008": "Of course I do!",
  "str_quest_chat_11483009": "Then what did you need from me?",
  "str_quest_chat_11483010": "... Nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_11483011": "... You wanted to ask about Hiiro, didn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11483012": "Not at all! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_11484001": "Whenever night falls, I'm always reminded of the Sea of Souls.",
  "str_quest_chat_11484002": "Mountains of black snow piled up over a vast wilderness.",
  "str_quest_chat_11484003": "Occasionally, a fragment of Quarkium tears through the sky, striking against the heavens like a match...",
  "str_quest_chat_11484004": "And leaving a glittering trail of starlight in its wake.",
  "str_quest_chat_11484005": "That sounds beautiful.",
  "str_quest_chat_11484006": "That's right. It was back then that I realized...",
  "str_quest_chat_11484007": "Beauty is often accompanied by danger.",
  "str_quest_chat_11484008": "That sounds lonely.",
  "str_quest_chat_11484009": "It is. Before then, I was convinced that I preferred being alone.",
  "str_quest_chat_11484010": "Ahem, sorry, I think I said too much.",
  "str_quest_chat_11484011": "Get some sleep, Colossus homebody.",
  "str_quest_chat_11484012": "... Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11501001": "How can you not be here during the Colossus preparation?",
  "str_quest_chat_11501002": "Colossus preparation?",
  "str_quest_chat_11501003": "Actually, it's fine even if I'm not around.",
  "str_quest_chat_11501004": "Yea. I had to cut down on my playtime to help!",
  "str_quest_chat_11501005": "No way! I'm already not playing around, so don't you dare slack off!",
  "str_quest_chat_11501006": "Anyway, come to the <color=#FFB400>Bridge</color> quickly! If you don't, I'll take it as you losing to me!",
  "str_quest_chat_11501007": "...You are so busy!",
  "str_quest_chat_11501999": "Either way, you should meet Gronru at the Bridge now! If you don't, she might do all sorts of things to the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_11502001": "Yo! Do you want to play a new game?",
  "str_quest_chat_11502002": "Huh? Another game?",
  "str_quest_chat_11502003": "Hmm? Why did I say another?",
  "str_quest_chat_11502004": "This game isn't very dangerous at all! I suppose it's a gaming hoop?",
  "str_quest_chat_11502005": "It's very fun!",
  "str_quest_chat_11502006": "Do you want to play with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_11502007": "What's a gaming hoop?",
  "str_quest_chat_11502008": "It's a special, round circle that rolls very well on the ground, and it never falls!",
  "str_quest_chat_11502009": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_11502010": "I'll go look for you once the testing on the gaming hoop is completed!",
  "str_quest_chat_11502011": "Um, okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_11502012": "You don't sound very happy!",
  "str_quest_chat_11502013": "Oh! It's not that, I just suddenly have an ominous...",
  "str_quest_chat_11502014": "An ominous what? I guarantee that the things I make are fun and safe! Just trust me!",
  "str_quest_chat_11502015": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_11502016": "Relax! It'll definitely be alright this time! Just wait for me to message you! Yo!",
  "str_quest_chat_11541001": "Goooooood morning, pilot of Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_11541002": "It's my first time aboard and, let me tell you, I'm so speechless! This must be the pinnacle of that bygone era's scientific knowledge!",
  "str_quest_chat_11541003": "Nice to meet you. Glad you like Soroz so much.",
  "str_quest_chat_11541004": "\"Soroz\", eh... What a cool name! It sounds like it's from that time.",
  "str_quest_chat_11541005": "Mm-hmm... So this is the so-called \"Perfect Creation\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_11541006": "\"That time\"...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11541007": "Correct! That mysterious, bygone era... The \"Ancient Civilization\"!",
  "str_quest_chat_11541008": "Whether it's the Colossus' pneumatic designs or its electromechanical structures, our current technology struggles to replicate any of them.",
  "str_quest_chat_11541009": "It transcends mere technology... It's technological artistry!",
  "str_quest_chat_11541010": "\"The Perfect Creation\"...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11541011": "That's right! You... don't seem to know very much about your Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_11541012": "When you consider all of its aspects, from its pneumatic designs to its electromechanical structures...",
  "str_quest_chat_11541013": "The Colossus is not just a technological marvel... It's technological artistry!",
  "str_quest_chat_11541014": "Oh... Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_11541015": "Although... There is one small flaw, a tiny one at that...",
  "str_quest_chat_11541016": "Huh? What flaw?",
  "str_quest_chat_11541017": "Its internal structures are all sealed shut! How am I supposed to research any of it if I can't access it?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11541018": "Never mind, I'll figure something out!",
  "str_quest_chat_11541019": "W-Wait! I don't know how to put it back together if you take it apart!",
  "str_quest_chat_11542001": "Ah... You're interested in my Throne, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11542002": "I'll let you in on a secret... It's also a relic of that ancient era...",
  "str_quest_chat_11542003": "I-I don't think I said anything about your Throne...",
  "str_quest_chat_11542004": "Very well. Seeing as you have no interest in literature, we can discuss other topics...",
  "str_quest_chat_11542005": "No thanks, I think I'm fine...",
  "str_quest_chat_11542006": "What?! Why on earth not?! Do you have any idea how powerful my Throne is? Something like Soroz will also...",
  "str_quest_chat_11542007": "You must learn everything there is to know!",
  "str_quest_chat_11542008": "Y-Yes, Commander!",
  "str_quest_chat_11542009": "V-Very well, Commander Gronru. Please enlighten me!",
  "str_quest_chat_11542010": "Hehe, now that's more like it! If you want to know, you'll have to trade me something for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11542011": "How can I say no?",
  "str_quest_chat_11542012": "Ahem... So, can you tell me more about your Throne?",
  "str_quest_chat_11542013": "Hem, that knowledge comes at a steep price. Can you afford it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11542014": "I have a bad feeling about this... What do you want for it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11542015": "Oh, nothing important! All I want is to take the Prism Pillar apart to study it...",
  "str_quest_chat_11542016": "!!!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_11542017": "No deal!!! Absolutely not!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_11542018": "Curses... Are you sure?",
  "str_quest_chat_11542019": "Of course I'm sure!!",
  "str_quest_chat_11542020": "What if I let you ride my Throne?",
  "str_quest_chat_11542021": "The answer's still no! Besides, I can't pilot it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11551001": "Come on! The game's already started!",
  "str_quest_chat_11551002": "Morning. What game are you taking about?",
  "str_quest_chat_11551003": "The who can get up earliest game! I won!",
  "str_quest_chat_11551004": "...You can't just make up a game like that without fair warning!",
  "str_quest_chat_11552001": "Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_11552002": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_11552003": "It's rare to hear you sounding so listless.",
  "str_quest_chat_11552004": "Because I don't feel like going to the Research Lab today...",
  "str_quest_chat_11552005": "But it's not like I have a choice. As a leader, I need to lead by example.",
  "str_quest_chat_11552006": "I'll just play my games later!",
  "str_quest_chat_11552007": "Yeah, I think it's better that way, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_11552008": "Hmm, I feel a little better after talking to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11552009": "Let's give it a go again...",
  "str_quest_chat_11552010": "Good morning, PlayerName!!",
  "str_quest_chat_11552011": "Right! Morning, Gronru!",
  "str_quest_chat_11553001": "Good morning! Do you like the sea?",
  "str_quest_chat_11553002": "Sure, I like it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11553003": "I find looking out at the sea a calming experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_11553004": "It's okay, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat_11553005": "Although the sea's picturesque, it can get quite hot...",
  "str_quest_chat_11553006": "Ahh, I see!",
  "str_quest_chat_11553007": "I really like the sea, but I don't often get the chance to visit it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11553008": "I'm usually occupied with work, and there are so many games to play!",
  "str_quest_chat_11553009": "I didn't realize you loved the sea that much...",
  "str_quest_chat_11553010": "And here I was thinking you were a diehard homebody!",
  "str_quest_chat_11553011": "Well, I do want to go out every once in a while!",
  "str_quest_chat_11553012": "And of course, I'll be sure to bring my portable game machine!",
  "str_quest_chat_11553013": "Haha, I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11553014": "So, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_11553015": "When the opportunity arises, why don't we go to the beach together?",
  "str_quest_chat_11553016": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_11554001": "Morning! I'm going to the testing grounds with Siobhan today!",
  "str_quest_chat_11554002": "Testing grounds?",
  "str_quest_chat_11554003": "Ahh, I mean the place we use to study those giant machines.",
  "str_quest_chat_11554004": "There's never a dull day there!",
  "str_quest_chat_11554005": "Hehe... Charon and Raphael have both been there too!",
  "str_quest_chat_11554006": "Ahh, I got it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11554007": "That's where the Emperor's Cup is held, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_11554008": "Regarding that...",
  "str_quest_chat_11554009": "I'm afraid it's confidential and I'm not authorized to reveal anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_11554010": "Hehe, but don't be too disappointed.",
  "str_quest_chat_11554011": "Next time... I'll tell you when I can bring you along!",
  "str_quest_chat_11554012": "After all, it's way more fun to see the ruins and experience it all in person than listen to a story, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_11554013": "Alright, I'll look forward to it then.",
  "str_quest_chat_11555001": "Morning! I've already started working.",
  "str_quest_chat_11555002": "That's early... I'm not even fully awake yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_11555003": "Well, things are a little hectic today because I need to review everyone's reports.",
  "str_quest_chat_11555004": "So that's how mornings are for a Tech Officer, huh...",
  "str_quest_chat_11555005": "But I much prefer mornings where I can spend time with my otome games!",
  "str_quest_chat_11555006": "Oops, I gotta go. Chandra's just arrived.",
  "str_quest_chat_11555007": "Well, all the best with work. Bye then.",
  "str_quest_chat_11561001": "You lost to me again, haha!",
  "str_quest_chat_11561002": "There's no way I can beat you!",
  "str_quest_chat_11561003": "As a punishment... You're paying for my meal today!",
  "str_quest_chat_11561004": "Again?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11561005": "Tee-hee, what should I have today...",
  "str_quest_chat_11561006": "Have mercy on me...",
  "str_quest_chat_11562001": "Have you played the game I lent you last time?",
  "str_quest_chat_11562002": "I haven't had the time yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_11562003": "Perfect! I'll come play it with you later this afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_11562004": "But I have something to do in the afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_11562005": "It's settled! Wait for me in the afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_11562006": "Listen to me finish!",
  "str_quest_chat_11563001": "Hmm... You seem a little tired.",
  "str_quest_chat_11563002": "Someone asked me to play games with her until the next morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_11563003": "Here, these will help you get a good night's rest!",
  "str_quest_chat_11563004": "I have a bad feeling, again...",
  "str_quest_chat_11564001": "Good afternoon! I've prepared a special lunch today according to our strategy!",
  "str_quest_chat_11564002": "What is this special lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_11564003": "Is this the famous Caelestite curiosity I've heard so much about?",
  "str_quest_chat_11564004": "Hah, lend me your Colossus and I'll tell you!",
  "str_quest_chat_11564005": "Well, I guess I won't ask then...",
  "str_quest_chat_11565001": "Right on time. Let's battle!",
  "str_quest_chat_11565002": "Battle? What battle?",
  "str_quest_chat_11565003": "Hmm... The battle of who can eat the most at lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_11565004": "That doesn't sound too healthy...",
  "str_quest_chat_11565005": "Who cares about health? Come on!",
  "str_quest_chat_11565006": "Ahaha... Actually, I really can't eat that much...",
  "str_quest_chat_11565007": "So, you win!",
  "str_quest_chat_11565008": "What an easy victory... Boring!",
  "str_quest_chat_11566001": "I heard that Caelestites play a special game... at lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_11566002": "What game?",
  "str_quest_chat_11566003": "Something called Firefly Lunch Brawl!",
  "str_quest_chat_11566004": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_11566005": "Is it? Heheh!",
  "str_quest_chat_11566006": "I'm sure there's no such thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_11566007": "Actually...",
  "str_quest_chat_11566008": "I just thought of it. We'll use the fireflies...",
  "str_quest_chat_11566009": "Stop treating them as game items...",
  "str_quest_chat_11566010": "How disappointing. It was a great idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_11567001": "Ugh, meetings, meetings, meetings... I hate meetings!",
  "str_quest_chat_11567002": "Good afternoon, Gronru.",
  "str_quest_chat_11567003": "It's not such a good afternoon when I have so many more meetings coming up...",
  "str_quest_chat_11567004": "Have you been in meetings all morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_11567005": "Not only that, there's more this afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_11567006": "Rats, I just hate going to meetings that where the Grand Marshal is present!",
  "str_quest_chat_11567007": "Is it because you can't play games during those meetings?",
  "str_quest_chat_11567008": "Eh? How'd you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_11567009": "It was pretty obvious.",
  "str_quest_chat_11567010": "Anyway, I need to play a game or two to recharge now!",
  "str_quest_chat_11567011": "Gotta run. Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_11567012": "All right. See you later.",
  "str_quest_chat_11568001": "Studying how machines operate is a game too, actually!",
  "str_quest_chat_11568002": "It's that effortless?",
  "str_quest_chat_11568003": "Yeah. When I get stuck, I just play a couple of machine assembly games to get unstuck!",
  "str_quest_chat_11568004": "What? Games like that exist?",
  "str_quest_chat_11568005": "Oh, poor PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_11568006": "It seems there's a lot you don't know about!",
  "str_quest_chat_11568007": "Well, I guess?",
  "str_quest_chat_11568008": "Heehee, fear not!",
  "str_quest_chat_11568009": "I'll put together a list of my recommendations for you during lunch break!",
  "str_quest_chat_11568010": "Follow it and you can't go wrong!",
  "str_quest_chat_11568011": "Ah... Sounds good. Thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_11569001": "It's lunch break! I must properly make use of this time to play games!",
  "str_quest_chat_11569002": "That's rare, Gronru.",
  "str_quest_chat_11569003": "Lunch break is almost over. You're only starting now?",
  "str_quest_chat_11569004": "Today's research report ran through lunch break!",
  "str_quest_chat_11569005": "Unimet also pointed out some of the problems she had...",
  "str_quest_chat_11569006": "No time for chatter, I'm about to begin. Good afternoon to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_11569007": "There's absolutely no room for interjection. Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11570001": "Leave a message if you need anything! If I don't reply, it means I'm working.",
  "str_quest_chat_11570002": "... Sure you're not playing your games?",
  "str_quest_chat_11570003": "Ohh? Afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_11570004": "Huh? That was a fast reply.",
  "str_quest_chat_11570005": "That's because I can see you're looking for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_11570006": "And I'm indeed playing a game, but I'll reply to your message before the next round starts, haha.",
  "str_quest_chat_11570007": "... I knew it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11570008": "Ahh, the next round's about to begin!",
  "str_quest_chat_11570009": "Enjoy your lunch break, PlayerName! I'm going back to my game!",
  "str_quest_chat_11570010": "Err, good day to you, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_11571001": "Guess what I'll be having for lunch today!",
  "str_quest_chat_11571002": "Illumina's meal ration?",
  "str_quest_chat_11571003": "Wrong! Try again!",
  "str_quest_chat_11571004": "Err... A lunch box from the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_11571005": "Nope, wrong again!",
  "str_quest_chat_11571006": "Just tell me... I don't think I'll be able to guess it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11571007": "Haha, alright then.",
  "str_quest_chat_11571008": "I'll be trying the popular barbecue from the desert region!",
  "str_quest_chat_11571009": "I hear it's really yummy!!",
  "str_quest_chat_11571010": "Well, it does taste pretty good.",
  "str_quest_chat_11571011": "Now that you mention it, I'm in the mood for barbecue myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_11571012": "Hehe, that's great!",
  "str_quest_chat_11572001": "Hey! Good afternoon! I tried a game from a new genre today!",
  "str_quest_chat_11572002": "There are actually games you haven't played before?",
  "str_quest_chat_11572003": "Of course. Those walking sim types of games.",
  "str_quest_chat_11572004": "Err... Walking simulation?",
  "str_quest_chat_11572005": "Why not just go for an actual walk?",
  "str_quest_chat_11572006": "Because I get to see so many types of sceneries while walking in the game!",
  "str_quest_chat_11572007": "It's a great way to relax and immerse in beauty!",
  "str_quest_chat_11572008": "I guess that does sound nice.",
  "str_quest_chat_11572009": "I just can't believe the types of games available these days...",
  "str_quest_chat_11573001": "I need to get more rest this afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11573002": "Ohh? Had a busy morning at work?",
  "str_quest_chat_11573003": "... Or did you spend all morning playing your games?",
  "str_quest_chat_11573004": "I wasn't gaming earlier today!",
  "str_quest_chat_11573005": "Some children paid a visit to the Research Lab and I needed to show them around.",
  "str_quest_chat_11573006": "You mean like an \"open day\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_11573007": "Something like that!",
  "str_quest_chat_11573008": "I was explaining to them how I manage Illumina's tech.",
  "str_quest_chat_11573009": "Wow, sounds like a real honor!",
  "str_quest_chat_11574001": "What should I do during my lunch break today?",
  "str_quest_chat_11574002": "Play your games?",
  "str_quest_chat_11574003": "Even with games, I can still get occasionally burnt out if I just keep at it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11574004": "Take a nap?",
  "str_quest_chat_11574005": "Technically speaking, sleep isn't high on my list of priorities...",
  "str_quest_chat_11574006": "Haha, I'm kidding!",
  "str_quest_chat_11574007": "Why don't you tell me what you're going to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_11574008": "It'll help me make up my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_11574009": "I'm going to workout a little!",
  "str_quest_chat_11574010": "I've been hearing many suggestions about exercising during my lunch break.",
  "str_quest_chat_11574011": "That does sound like a good choice.",
  "str_quest_chat_11574012": "Would you like to try it out as well?",
  "str_quest_chat_11574013": "Alright, just this once.",
  "str_quest_chat_11581001": "Don't get sleepy!",
  "str_quest_chat_11581002": "Let's make a new dungeon together!",
  "str_quest_chat_11581003": "What dungeon?",
  "str_quest_chat_11581004": "Umm... How about an exploring the Colossus dungeon?",
  "str_quest_chat_11581005": "I get the feeling this won't be a leisurely exploration...",
  "str_quest_chat_11581006": "You got it! We've gotta take the Colossus apart first!",
  "str_quest_chat_11581007": "Don't worry, I know my way around this kind of old technology.",
  "str_quest_chat_11581008": "I think... I'm going to have to say no.",
  "str_quest_chat_11582001": "I'm getting ready for bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_11582002": "Goodnight, then. I have a little more work to do...",
  "str_quest_chat_11582003": "Really? In that case, wanna play a little game?",
  "str_quest_chat_11582004": "Just to help you relax after a hard day's work!",
  "str_quest_chat_11582005": "Haha... Actually, I'll be heading to bed soon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11582006": "Hmm... I see. You're afraid of losing to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_11583001": "Evening! I'm about to clear the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_11583002": "Evening. Erm... what do you mean by clear?",
  "str_quest_chat_11583003": "I've studied every part of it! I'm heading for 100% completion!",
  "str_quest_chat_11583004": "It's just like Throne, the technology of those ancient times...",
  "str_quest_chat_11583005": "Hah, get ready for the next round!",
  "str_quest_chat_11583006": "Well, as long as you don't destroy the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_11584001": "Please don't be",
  "str_quest_chat_11584002": "What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_11584003": "If there's an issue with the Colossus, be sure to tell me. I'll fix it right away.",
  "str_quest_chat_11584004": "Wait... I just went through all the checks today...",
  "str_quest_chat_11584005": "Hmm... The lock... it broke just now...",
  "str_quest_chat_11584006": "It's you... You did it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11584007": "Right, I was just doing research...",
  "str_quest_chat_11584008": "I'll send the fireflies over.",
  "str_quest_chat_11584009": "Wait! No need! I've already changed it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11584010": "I'll get the fireflies to send over the backup key tomorrow. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11584011": "...Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11585001": "So... sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_11585002": "But I want to clear this level first...",
  "str_quest_chat_11585003": "Maybe just stay up all night, then?",
  "str_quest_chat_11585004": "You won't sleep well with that on your mind, and will wake up tired the next day, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_11585005": "Maybe you should turn in now?",
  "str_quest_chat_11585006": "I understand that feeling, but staying up late isn't good for your body.",
  "str_quest_chat_11585007": "Hmm, yeah, you've got a point!",
  "str_quest_chat_11585008": "That's what I'll do, then!",
  "str_quest_chat_11585009": "Yup!",
  "str_quest_chat_11586001": "Hey, PlayerName, guess what I've got to tell you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11586002": "You're not getting me to play games with you again, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11586003": "It's late, Gronru!",
  "str_quest_chat_11586004": "Wrong!",
  "str_quest_chat_11586005": "I'm here to tell you I plan to go to bed early today!",
  "str_quest_chat_11586006": "You must be getting ready for bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_11586007": "That's right!",
  "str_quest_chat_11586008": "Going to bed early, this is new for you, Gronru...",
  "str_quest_chat_11586009": "Yup!",
  "str_quest_chat_11586010": "Well then, good night, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_11586011": "Night, Gronru.",
  "str_quest_chat_11587001": "Oh my, it's so late already?",
  "str_quest_chat_11587002": "Yup, you should rest up.",
  "str_quest_chat_11587003": "What if I can't play my game while I work...",
  "str_quest_chat_11587004": "You're not meant to in the first place!",
  "str_quest_chat_11587005": "But we didn't do anything wrong!",
  "str_quest_chat_11587006": "It just seems neither fun nor productive.",
  "str_quest_chat_11587007": "We shouldn't do it anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_11587008": "... agreed.",
  "str_quest_chat_11587009": "Fine, fine. I'll go straight to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_11587010": "Hmm. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11588001": "It's that time again!",
  "str_quest_chat_11588002": "Yep, time for a break.",
  "str_quest_chat_11588003": "I don't know why, but I feel the urge to write a journal entry today!",
  "str_quest_chat_11588004": "Don't you usually do that?",
  "str_quest_chat_11588005": "It depends on my mood.",
  "str_quest_chat_11588006": "Well, I'm gonna go write in my journal. Rest well, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_11588007": "Alright then, goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_11589001": "Hehe, I had a wonderful supper!",
  "str_quest_chat_11589002": "As expected. Looks like you aren't one to be concerned about gaining weight.",
  "str_quest_chat_11589003": "I care more about satisfying my cravings than the tiresome thought of worrying about putting on a few pounds!",
  "str_quest_chat_11589004": "You've gotta just do whatever you want when you want to, otherwise it's just meaningless.",
  "str_quest_chat_11589005": "Would you like to join me, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_11589006": "Thanks, but no thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_11589007": "It's late, and I'm worried I won't be able to fall asleep if I indulge in supper.",
  "str_quest_chat_11589008": "Well, that's a pity...",
  "str_quest_chat_11590001": "Darn, darn, darn, screw this! I lost!",
  "str_quest_chat_11590002": "It's late. Are you still playing games?",
  "str_quest_chat_11590003": "If I don't make it into the leaderboard today, I won't be able to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_11590004": "Wow, what a competitive spirit!",
  "str_quest_chat_11590005": "Uh-huh, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_11590006": "Well, time's ticking away! You go get some rest and I'll tell you how I did in the morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_11590007": "Well... Don't stay up too late.",
  "str_quest_chat_11590008": "Gotcha. Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_11591001": "*sniff* ... The plot of the game I finished today was so touching...",
  "str_quest_chat_11591002": "What kind of story was it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11591003": "It told the story of a young girl and a sentient giant machine!",
  "str_quest_chat_11591004": "Uh... Was it a love story?",
  "str_quest_chat_11591005": "It did have romance...",
  "str_quest_chat_11591006": "But I think the most touching part about it was when \"two ordinary beings joined forces against the tide of time.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_11591007": "That sounds really complex...",
  "str_quest_chat_11591008": "It is, but the emotions behind it were really moving!",
  "str_quest_chat_11591009": "*sniff* Well, night then, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_11591010": "I'm gonna replay the entire game!",
  "str_quest_chat_11591011": "Err, goodnight then...",
  "str_quest_chat_11592001": "What do you think about before sleeping every night?",
  "str_quest_chat_11592002": "My plans for the next day.",
  "str_quest_chat_11592003": "Wow, really?",
  "str_quest_chat_11592004": "Just wherever my mind leads me to...",
  "str_quest_chat_11592005": "Ohh? Tell me more!",
  "str_quest_chat_11592006": "Do you think it helps you sleep better?",
  "str_quest_chat_11592007": "Your guess is as good as mine.",
  "str_quest_chat_11592008": "I feel like I just drift off to sleep every time.",
  "str_quest_chat_11592009": "What... And here I thought a Caelestite would have some kind of special method!",
  "str_quest_chat_11592010": "Do you have trouble sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_11592011": "Nope, I was just curious.",
  "str_quest_chat_11592012": "After all, I don't need to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_11592013": "R-really?",
  "str_quest_chat_11592014": "Hehe... It's a secret.",
  "str_quest_chat_11592015": "Have a good night's sleep, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_11592016": "Hmm... I *am* feeling a little sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_11592017": "Night, Gronru.",
  "str_quest_chat_11601001": "So you're that special person?",
  "str_quest_chat_11601002": "???",
  "str_quest_chat_11601003": "I guess I am.",
  "str_quest_chat_11601004": "How are you still confused at this stage? You got to at least act shrewd, got it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11601005": "That reaction was quite clever, but not enough.",
  "str_quest_chat_11601006": "Anyway, I've been wanting to see you for a long time! Come see me!",
  "str_quest_chat_11601007": "Wait, don't we know each other? Why suddenly...",
  "str_quest_chat_11601008": "Cut the crap. Where are you? Come and see me!",
  "str_quest_chat_11601009": "I'm waiting for you at the <color=#FFB400>Bar</color>. Come here before it's too late!",
  "str_quest_chat_11601010": "I think we have a lot to talk about between us!",
  "str_quest_chat_11601999": "Barton seems to be waiting anxiously in the Bar. What does he want to tell you? Go find out now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11602001": "Where are you? Hey! Come out!",
  "str_quest_chat_11602002": "I'm coming out.",
  "str_quest_chat_11602003": "Let me ask you. How long have we known each other for?",
  "str_quest_chat_11602004": "It hasn't been that long.",
  "str_quest_chat_11602005": "Are you serious? How much longer do you need it to be?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11602006": "Super long—since the sea ran dry and the rocks crumbled.",
  "str_quest_chat_11602007": "Oh? I didn't know you had such a way with words.",
  "str_quest_chat_11602008": "So, what do you actually want to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_11602009": "Come and meet me. I'll teach you the ultimate secret of battle!",
  "str_quest_chat_11602010": "Just tell me here. It's more convenient...",
  "str_quest_chat_11602011": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_11602012": "The ultimate secret to winning battles is making sneak attacks whenever possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_11602013": "You've told me that countless times already!",
  "str_quest_chat_11602014": "But I haven't demonstrated, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_11602015": "What do you want to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_11602016": "As they say, you have to practice something to really learn it. It's time for you to experience it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11641001": "Hey there, Navigator. Looking for a quick battle?",
  "str_quest_chat_11641002": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_11641003": "I'd fight with everything I got if I had no choice.",
  "str_quest_chat_11641004": "But since I have a choice... My answer should be clear.",
  "str_quest_chat_11641005": "Why do you want to battle, anyways?",
  "str_quest_chat_11641006": "Answer me, first!",
  "str_quest_chat_11641007": "Fine... No, I have no desire to battle you. I enjoy peace.",
  "str_quest_chat_11641008": "Ah, you're one of THOSE people... How boring.",
  "str_quest_chat_11641009": "So I take it we can't have firefights on the Colossus, then?",
  "str_quest_chat_11641010": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_11641011": "There are so many armed fighters on board...",
  "str_quest_chat_11641012": "But that doesn't mean you get to play around with your weapons!",
  "str_quest_chat_11641013": "Then I have no interest in such a quiet, boring place.",
  "str_quest_chat_11641014": "Who could think peace is \"boring\"...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11641015": "You don't think so? War and struggle... These are the only things that matter to a soldier!",
  "str_quest_chat_11641016": "If conflict doesn't exist here, maybe it's time I stirred some up...",
  "str_quest_chat_11641017": "Hey... Why do I get the impression you're plotting something dangerous?",
  "str_quest_chat_11651001": "Navigator! Wake up...!",
  "str_quest_chat_11651002": "What do you mean? I woke up a long time ago...",
  "str_quest_chat_11651003": "Really? Then why haven't I seen you today?",
  "str_quest_chat_11651004": "Because I'm still in my room...",
  "str_quest_chat_11651005": "To a real military man...",
  "str_quest_chat_11651006": "You aren't really awake until you've done your morning exercise!",
  "str_quest_chat_11651007": "Sure, but I was never in the military...",
  "str_quest_chat_11651008": "What's this? The great and courageous Navigator, calling it quits this early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_11651009": "Fine, I'll go train right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_11652001": "Ah!",
  "str_quest_chat_11652002": "What's the matter? Is everything okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_11652003": "Nothing. Just wish something would happen, is all.",
  "str_quest_chat_11652004": "Unfortunately, everything is perfectly normal and peaceful this morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_11652005": "Isn't that a good thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_11652006": "At this rate, my jaw is going to rust over...",
  "str_quest_chat_11652007": "Oh, yeah! Breakfast this morning was really tough to chew...",
  "str_quest_chat_11652008": "I'm sure you can get a really good jaw workout with that!",
  "str_quest_chat_11652009": "Really? I'll go try it right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_11653001": "I don't know what's happened to me recently, but I've been obsessed with having a full-course barbecue meal for breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_11653002": "That's a lot to eat in the morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_11653003": "You need to eat sufficiently to fight well!",
  "str_quest_chat_11653004": "You should give it a go next time! Otherwise, you'll probably remain a weakling.",
  "str_quest_chat_11653005": "Ahem, alright... Though I can't say I agree with your statement.",
  "str_quest_chat_11654001": "Black Umbrella's newly developed drink is pretty good.",
  "str_quest_chat_11654002": "What drink?",
  "str_quest_chat_11654003": "It's a drink that makes you feel energized.",
  "str_quest_chat_11654004": "What is Black Umbrella?",
  "str_quest_chat_11654005": "Come on, don't tell me you've never heard of Black Umbrella Laboratories!",
  "str_quest_chat_11654006": "Those Black Umbrella fellows are all science researchers!",
  "str_quest_chat_11654007": "It's a drink that lets you feel the energy coursing through your body after you drink it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11654008": "Ah, I see!",
  "str_quest_chat_11654009": "Yes, but it's still a work in progress and what I drank was just a trial.",
  "str_quest_chat_11654010": "Once the actual product's completed, I'll get you some to try!",
  "str_quest_chat_11654011": "Ohh, thanks in advance!",
  "str_quest_chat_11661001": "This Colossus of yours ain't bad! It's got just about everything!",
  "str_quest_chat_11661002": "Th-Thanks for the kind words. If you can't find what you need, just let me know.",
  "str_quest_chat_11661003": "I think the warehouse's drinks could use some restocking.",
  "str_quest_chat_11661004": "Hmm? I could've sworn there were plenty in there already...",
  "str_quest_chat_11661005": "The drinks in there are perfect for washing my face.",
  "str_quest_chat_11661006": "My jaw feels brand-new after washing with them!",
  "str_quest_chat_11661007": "But there weren't too many left in the warehouse. I've almost gone through all of them in just the last few days!",
  "str_quest_chat_11661008": "Huh? You aren't talking about my special, hard-to-find lemon water, are you...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11662001": "What do you think you're doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_11662002": "H-Having lunch...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11662003": "Heh, so you think you can just have lunch whenever you please?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11662004": "D-Did I do something wrong...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11662005": "Doesn't anyone in this entire, humongous Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_11662006": "Enjoy playing war games?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11662007": "I don't think they necessarily dislike playing war games, it's just...",
  "str_quest_chat_11662008": "Just what?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11662009": "N-Nothing! It's just... maybe you're too good...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11662010": "Hahahahaha! Finally, someone who understands!",
  "str_quest_chat_11663001": "I heard Umbraton has a new wargame! Have you heard of it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11663002": "Not at all...",
  "str_quest_chat_11663003": "What new wargame?",
  "str_quest_chat_11663004": "I thought you drop by Umbraton quite often? How come you don't know?",
  "str_quest_chat_11663005": "It's a wargame with new mechanics and maps that'll keep you interested for days!",
  "str_quest_chat_11663006": "Maybe it's because I'm not interested in them, to begin with...",
  "str_quest_chat_11663007": "But how did you get to know so much about it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11663008": "Because I'm bored! I got nothing to do since there are no battles to be fought!",
  "str_quest_chat_11663009": "Wanna play after the meal?",
  "str_quest_chat_11663010": "Well... I still have work to do in the afternoon, so, no thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_11664001": "The sun is so harsh this afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11664002": "Would you like to go back to your room to rest?",
  "str_quest_chat_11664003": "You read my mind!",
  "str_quest_chat_11664004": "I've had it with these meetings, reports, and analyses!",
  "str_quest_chat_11664005": "Screw them, I'm gonna go take a nap!",
  "str_quest_chat_11664006": "Good call, Barton.",
  "str_quest_chat_11681001": "Why is it so quiet around here?",
  "str_quest_chat_11681002": "Well, it is nighttime... Maybe everyone's asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_11681003": "Sleep? Sleep?? But isn't sleep boring to you people?!",
  "str_quest_chat_11681004": "Why don't we play some games instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_11681005": "Huh? You like playing games, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_11681006": "Do I look like someone who doesn't play games...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11681007": "N-Not at all! I just figured a Legion Commander wouldn't have time to play...",
  "str_quest_chat_11681008": "...Ah, forget it. You look tired enough already. Off to bed, you!",
  "str_quest_chat_11681009": "We'll play some other time. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11682001": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_11682002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11682003": "It's been way too peaceful around here lately... When are we going to find some Eclipsites for fighting?",
  "str_quest_chat_11682004": "Aren't peaceful days something we should all wish for?",
  "str_quest_chat_11682005": "A soldier's instinct is to show his combat prowess. So what does that make me now?",
  "str_quest_chat_11682006": "A soldier is trained for a thousand days to help others in their hour of need.",
  "str_quest_chat_11682007": "Fighting in battles all days isn't the only thing that validates a soldier's existence.",
  "str_quest_chat_11682008": "Hah? You've gotten some nerve, scolding a Legion Commander of Illumina...",
  "str_quest_chat_11682009": "I-I was just saying what was on my mind...",
  "str_quest_chat_11682010": "Although, it looks like you might have a point...",
  "str_quest_chat_11682011": "I need some time to think.",
  "str_quest_chat_11683001": "I'm getting ready for bed, kid!",
  "str_quest_chat_11683002": "Guess you don't like to stay up late.",
  "str_quest_chat_11683003": "Of course I don't. There's no benefit to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11683004": "I'm getting ready for bed, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_11683005": "Going to bed early is a good habit!",
  "str_quest_chat_11683006": "Though it's earlier than usual for me today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11683007": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_11683008": "I spent the whole day with the rookies and that really wore me out! Got no stamina left for exercising now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11683009": "So, I decided to get up early tomorrow and make up for today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11683010": "You have so much self-discipline!",
  "str_quest_chat_11683011": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_11683012": "It's bedtime! Good night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_11683013": "Good night, Barton!",
  "str_quest_chat_11684001": "I just got back from the rookie training camp today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11684002": "It's pretty late. You must have worked hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_11684003": "Pfft, hard, my ass!",
  "str_quest_chat_11684004": "All I did was a hundred push-ups in one go in front of those young fellows.",
  "str_quest_chat_11684005": "That's the life of a soldier!",
  "str_quest_chat_11684006": "... I think you probably scared them.",
  "str_quest_chat_11684007": "All the more reason to train harder then if you're scared!",
  "str_quest_chat_11684008": "Mm, I guess you're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_11684009": "Well, it's getting late, so I'm going to go to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_11684010": "You should turn in early as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_11684011": "Night then, Barton.",
  "str_quest_chat_11685001": "Hey, kid!",
  "str_quest_chat_11685002": "Hi, Barton.",
  "str_quest_chat_11685003": "You're still up this late?",
  "str_quest_chat_11685004": "I just got done training for the night, and I'm about to turn in.",
  "str_quest_chat_11685005": "You sure go to bed late all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_11685006": "True... And I can't get up the next day, either.",
  "str_quest_chat_11685007": "That's why you shouldn't burn the midnight oil, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_11685008": "Get enough rest, so you have the energy to train!",
  "str_quest_chat_11685009": "All right, I'll hit the sack right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11685010": "You probably should too, for your training tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_11685011": "Of course. Good night, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_11685012": "Good night, Barton.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701001": "Regarding the Cooperation Invitation, Illumina has prepared specific instructions.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701002": "For Illumina and I, to work together with all of you is a great opportunity.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701003": "Please feel free to contact me if you need any assistance.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701004": "I will assist you to the best of my abilities.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701005": "Me! Please help me!",
  "str_quest_chat_11701006": "It's probably nothing serious, but can I trouble you for a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_11701007": "There's no rush.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701008": "Please speak before passing judgments.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701009": "I'm free now. Can you come to the <color=#FFB400>lounge</color> to chat face-to-face?",
  "str_quest_chat_11701010": "I'll have you know that I'm not free every day!",
  "str_quest_chat_11701021": "About that note, you can ignore the contents of it until I confirm the other party's intentions before proceeding to reply.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701022": "I thought back to your account and found something quite unpleasant to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701023": "Did I say something that offended you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11701024": "Hmm... Could you tell me what is it that upset you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11701025": "Please don't misunderstand. I wasn't offended at all. On the contrary, I should be the one apologizing to you for the rudeness of my colleague.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701026": "What upset me was Wrath's behavior. I shall get her to apologize to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701027": "You once said that you found traces of dirt on your bed sheets...",
  "str_quest_chat_11701028": "I figure it's because Wrath stepped on your bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_11701999": "Go to the lounge to find Hiiro. She doesn't have much time, so she might not stay waiting for very long.",
  "str_quest_chat_11702001": "PlayerName, have you gotten used to the training these few days?",
  "str_quest_chat_11702002": "Oh... I guess I'm okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_11702003": "You sound a little reluctant. Are you feeling tired?",
  "str_quest_chat_11702004": "A little. Can you take it easier on me next time?",
  "str_quest_chat_11702005": "My training plan must be followed to the letter. Don't even think of slacking off.",
  "str_quest_chat_11702006": "But you do sound a little tired. Are you still tired after having rested for a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_11702007": "A little.",
  "str_quest_chat_11702008": "You should exercise more. Your body will waste away if you sit there doing nothing on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_11702009": "It's good that your muscles are sore. It means your strength is improving.",
  "str_quest_chat_11702010": "I suppose it's necessary to help you relieve your pain for this beginners' training. I have some ointments on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_11702011": "Go and apply some if you can't take it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11702012": "Oh... Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11741001": "Hello, my name is Hiiro. It is a pleasure to meet you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11741002": "Please accept my apologies if I interrupted you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11741003": "O-Oh no, there's no trouble at all, Miss Hiiro. The pleasure is mine!",
  "str_quest_chat_11741004": "(Huh... Why am I being so formal?)",
  "str_quest_chat_11741005": "I am honored. Pardon me, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_11741006": "Is there a meditation chamber on this Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_11741007": "\"Meditation\"...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11741008": "Erm, if you're looking for a quiet place, there's a spare room you could use?",
  "str_quest_chat_11741009": "As for a \"meditation chamber,\" I don't know exactly what you mean...",
  "str_quest_chat_11741010": "Hmm... Understood.",
  "str_quest_chat_11741011": "If there is no meditation chamber, then I must focus even harder on my training.",
  "str_quest_chat_11741012": "Y-You're very diligent, Miss Hiiro...",
  "str_quest_chat_11741013": "From this day forward, I shall continue on my path to enlightenment aboard this frugal Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_11741014": "Um... Glad to be of service...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11742001": "I can sense my kendo has improved significantly.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742002": "But in my diligence, have I grown hasty? I cannot afford to lose my way...",
  "str_quest_chat_11742003": "If my progress along the path of righteousness is not steady, both my mind and my blade will lose their edge.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742004": "Are you doubting yourself, Miss Hiiro?",
  "str_quest_chat_11742005": "Quite so.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742006": "That's a surprise...",
  "str_quest_chat_11742007": "That isn't like you, Hiiro.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742008": "I wholeheartedly agree.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742009": "Perhaps this is yet another obstacle on my path to be overcome.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742010": "Miss Hiiro... You're always so disciplined and your resolve has never wavered once.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742011": "But you expect so much from yourself... I don't think I've ever seen you NOT training.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742012": "You have a point.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742013": "I can assure you, there is no need to be so hard on yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742014": "Even the smallest improvements are a testament to your rigorous training and conviction. I think you're still on the right path!",
  "str_quest_chat_11742015": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742016": "In other words, my doubts about my progress are an affirmation of my resolve...",
  "str_quest_chat_11742017": "Thank you. My mind feels clear once more.",
  "str_quest_chat_11742018": "I will continue with my training and show you my resolve through my katana.",
  "str_quest_chat_11751001": "Good morning! Have you made up your mind about learning swordsmanship?",
  "str_quest_chat_11751002": "... I-I think I'll give it a pass.",
  "str_quest_chat_11751003": "So, you were just messing with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_11751004": "No, no, no! I dare not!",
  "str_quest_chat_11751005": "Are you going to learn it then?",
  "str_quest_chat_11751006": "I'll learn it! I will!",
  "str_quest_chat_11752001": "It's almost 10am. Did you just wake up?",
  "str_quest_chat_11752002": "Oh... I slept at 4am last night because I was reading.",
  "str_quest_chat_11752003": "Take care of yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_11752004": "Are you worried about me?",
  "str_quest_chat_11752005": "... Did you forget it was your turn to make breakfast today?",
  "str_quest_chat_11752006": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_11753001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_11753002": "Good morning... Hiiro. It's really early...",
  "str_quest_chat_11753003": "That's what I wanted to talk to you about.",
  "str_quest_chat_11753004": "You seem to be quite awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_11753005": "...You wanted to make sure I was awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_11754001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_11754002": "Morning, Commander Hiiro!",
  "str_quest_chat_11754003": "The flowers on Cloud Mountain are particularly pretty during this season.",
  "str_quest_chat_11754004": "I'm used to going for a morning stroll among the flowers.",
  "str_quest_chat_11754005": "But there aren't many flowers in Gannon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11754006": "Are you homesick or in low spirits, Commander Hiiro?",
  "str_quest_chat_11754007": "Never mind what I said. I'll get myself together.",
  "str_quest_chat_11754008": "Regardless, let's keep our spirits up to welcome this new day, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_11754009": "Yes!",
  "str_quest_chat_11754010": "You too, Commander Hiiro!",
  "str_quest_chat_11755001": "Morning. The wind is very different up here on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_11755002": "It gets much stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_11755003": "Because of the height, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat_11755004": "Is it bothering you, Commander Hiiro?",
  "str_quest_chat_11755005": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_11755006": "Tough environments only make me stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_11761001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11761002": "Good afternoon, Miss Hiiro. Have you eaten?",
  "str_quest_chat_11761003": "Not yet. I plan to use my lunch time today to meditate.",
  "str_quest_chat_11761004": "But... won't you get hungry?",
  "str_quest_chat_11761005": "No. There is no training this afternoon, so I won't need to use up too much energy.",
  "str_quest_chat_11761006": "If your stomach is too full while meditating, it becomes easier to get distracted.",
  "str_quest_chat_11761007": "Same old Hiiro...",
  "str_quest_chat_11762001": "Sorry to bother you.",
  "str_quest_chat_11762002": "What do I need to do if I want the Fireflies to stay with me for a fixed period of time this afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_11762003": "You could never bother me, Miss Hiiro.",
  "str_quest_chat_11762004": "Just explain what you want directly to the Fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat_11762005": "But... why do you want them to stick around?",
  "str_quest_chat_11762006": "Because I wish to train my concentration and test whether I can prevent my thoughts from being distracted by external entities.",
  "str_quest_chat_11762007": "Alright. I hope you won't find them too annoying...",
  "str_quest_chat_11763001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11763002": "Have you arranged the training plan for this afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_11763003": "Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_11763004": "I'll do it now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11763005": "Hmm. You being the leader of this place, I should hope so.",
  "str_quest_chat_11763006": "I wouldn't expect you to hope for any less, Miss Hiiro...",
  "str_quest_chat_11764001": "PlayerName, how much do you know about the Far East?",
  "str_quest_chat_11764002": "Not much...",
  "str_quest_chat_11764003": "Understandable, it is rather far away.",
  "str_quest_chat_11764004": "A bit.",
  "str_quest_chat_11764005": "So what exactly do you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_11764006": "It... has a very different culture.",
  "str_quest_chat_11764007": "Yes, indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_11764008": "Why are you asking?",
  "str_quest_chat_11764009": "Oh, I just suddenly feel you and I are somehow alike.",
  "str_quest_chat_11764010": "Alike?",
  "str_quest_chat_11764011": "We were both outsiders to this land at first.",
  "str_quest_chat_11764012": "Outsiders... Is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11765001": "Afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_11765002": "Good afternoon, Commander Hiiro.",
  "str_quest_chat_11765003": "Let me rest a while. This morning's training was tough...",
  "str_quest_chat_11765004": "I saw. You sure put a lot of effort in.",
  "str_quest_chat_11765005": "Take a break and build up your strength for future training.",
  "str_quest_chat_11765006": "Yes, Commander...",
  "str_quest_chat_11781001": "It's getting late.",
  "str_quest_chat_11781002": "Maybe you should consider having an early night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11781003": "Indeed. I'm going to get ready for bed after I finish what I'm doing right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11781004": "If it's not too bold of me to ask, could you tell me what it is you're doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_11781005": "Just... eat something that helps me sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_11781006": "...I don't think a midnight snack will help you sleep any better.",
  "str_quest_chat_11781007": "But now that you've started, be sure not to waste any food.",
  "str_quest_chat_11781008": "Rest early after you finish eating. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11781009": "...Alright, Miss Hiiro. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11782001": "Good evening. Vice told me everything.",
  "str_quest_chat_11782002": "Ah! Good evening, Miss Hiiro!",
  "str_quest_chat_11782003": "...I'm always honest with you, you know that!",
  "str_quest_chat_11782004": "...I haven't done anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_11782005": "...So, what did Vice tell you, exactly?",
  "str_quest_chat_11782006": "She invited you to have a midnight snack with her, but you turned her down.",
  "str_quest_chat_11782007": "You're making progress.",
  "str_quest_chat_11782008": "Thank you! But actually...",
  "str_quest_chat_11782009": "Whatever the reason, declining such a request is a good thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_11782010": "Sleep well, and good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_11782011": "...Sleep well, Miss Hiiro.",
  "str_quest_chat_11783001": "It's time to rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_11783002": "The moment between being in a deep sleep and fully awake is indeed a strange state of consciousness.",
  "str_quest_chat_11783003": "At this time, my thoughts wander, and I try my best to control them.",
  "str_quest_chat_11783004": "But if it's a good rest you want...",
  "str_quest_chat_11783005": "Shouldn't you clear your mind and go to sleep early?",
  "str_quest_chat_11783006": "...You're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_11783007": "Forcing yourself to stay awake causes you to lose time you could be sleeping. It's really not a good idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_11783008": "Well, I'm retiring. You should rest early, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_11783009": "Good night, Miss Hiiro.",
  "str_quest_chat_11784001": "PlayerName, what do you usually do at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_11784002": "Well... If time permits... I like to zone out.",
  "str_quest_chat_11784003": "Zone out?",
  "str_quest_chat_11784004": "In other words, do nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_11784005": "Won't you get lazy like that?",
  "str_quest_chat_11784006": "Weapons must be maintained, and our minds as well. Zoning out rests the mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_11784007": "Can't argue with that.",
  "str_quest_chat_11785001": "Okay, time for my pre-sleep meditation.",
  "str_quest_chat_11785002": "You meditate before sleeping, Commander Hiiro?",
  "str_quest_chat_11785003": "That sounds intense...",
  "str_quest_chat_11785004": "That sounds disciplined...",
  "str_quest_chat_11785005": "Oh, it's nothing physically tiring. I just review the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_11785006": "To assess the outcomes of your meditation?",
  "str_quest_chat_11785007": "That's part of it. But more importantly, it's to identify opportunities for further improvement.",
  "str_quest_chat_11785008": "I must be constantly aware of the progress I'm making and adjust my practice accordingly.",
  "str_quest_chat_11785009": "It sounds complicated...",
  "str_quest_chat_11785010": "You could try it too if you want.",
  "str_quest_chat_11785011": "Er, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_11801001": "Are you free right now? Am I bothering you?",
  "str_quest_chat_11801002": "I've got some free time.",
  "str_quest_chat_11801003": "Actually, right now I'm a bit...",
  "str_quest_chat_11801004": "Great, I've prepared some refreshing coffee for you, the kind I'm good at making, a special blend. I hope you will enjoy it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11801005": "Well, you seem a little down today, so I thought I should prepare you a nice cup of coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat_11801006": "Of course, if you're busy, it's fine...",
  "str_quest_chat_11801007": "But if you would like some, do meet me at the <color=#FFB400>Cafe</color>!",
  "str_quest_chat_11801999": "Since Connolly summoned so much courage to invite you, she must really want you to meet her at the Cafe!",
  "str_quest_chat_11802001": "PlayerName, about the silky smooth coffee...",
  "str_quest_chat_11802002": "Yeah, I'm listening.",
  "str_quest_chat_11802003": "Oh, it's the new item I asked you to try earlier...",
  "str_quest_chat_11802004": "Ah, I remember now.",
  "str_quest_chat_11802005": "I've already tried it and evaluated it seriously.",
  "str_quest_chat_11802006": "S-so? Do you have any suggestions?",
  "str_quest_chat_11802007": "I'd say it tastes more like chocolate than coffee... I don't taste any coffee at all...",
  "str_quest_chat_11802008": "C-chocolate?",
  "str_quest_chat_11802009": "Oh no... I didn't turn the lights on when I mixed the ingredients... I must have used cocoa powder instead of ground coffee...",
  "str_quest_chat_11802010": "Boo-hoo... I wanted to try a new recipe, but I ended up making something completely different...",
  "str_quest_chat_11802011": "D-don't cry... Um... it was really smooth!",
  "str_quest_chat_11802012": "... Huh? Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_11802013": "Yes! Although you can't add silky smooth coffee to the menu, you can add silky smooth hot chocolate instead!",
  "str_quest_chat_11802014": "I-I see! You're so smart, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_11802015": "Then... I'll add silky smooth chocolate to the menu...",
  "str_quest_chat_11802016": "Oh right... When the coffee is correctly made next time... PlayerName, please taste it for me...",
  "str_quest_chat_11802017": "No problem!",
  "str_quest_chat_11803001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_11803002": "Connolly, terrific!",
  "str_quest_chat_11803003": "You were the brightest star in today's race!",
  "str_quest_chat_11803004": "Your chanting and dance routine cheered everyone up!",
  "str_quest_chat_11803005": "It's all thanks to yesterday's training.",
  "str_quest_chat_11803006": "I wouldn't have been able to do any of this without PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_11803007": "I knew you could do it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11803008": "You make a better cheerleader than me, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_11803009": "Sheol wanted me to tell you...",
  "str_quest_chat_11803010": "Her clients are interested in the proposal for a male cheerleading squad.",
  "str_quest_chat_11803011": "So maybe next time... we can...",
  "str_quest_chat_11803012": "I... I'll think about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11841001": "G... Greetings...",
  "str_quest_chat_11841002": "T-Thank you for having me aboard this Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_11841003": "I... I like this place so much...",
  "str_quest_chat_11841004": "Ah, that's good to hear! Don't mention it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11841005": "We're all good friends here, so please enjoy your time here with everyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_11841006": "O... Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_11841007": "But... Um...",
  "str_quest_chat_11841008": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_11841009": "E-Excuse me... Is it alright if... if I practice my clarinet?",
  "str_quest_chat_11841010": "Clarinet? Sure, no problem.",
  "str_quest_chat_11841011": "As long as you're not disturbing others, it's fine!",
  "str_quest_chat_11841012": "Okay... I won't bother anyone...",
  "str_quest_chat_11841013": "I-I'll find a somewhere to practice quietly...",
  "str_quest_chat_11841014": "No problem! We'd love to hear you play, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_11841015": "Ah...! O-Okay, then...",
  "str_quest_chat_11842001": "G... Greetings...",
  "str_quest_chat_11842002": "Um, I-I'm sorry... Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat_11842003": "Huh? Is something wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_11842004": "Th-These spirits... There are more, again...",
  "str_quest_chat_11842005": "They're so scary. I... I don't know what to do...",
  "str_quest_chat_11842006": "Spirits?",
  "str_quest_chat_11842007": "Spirits? You mean those things you summoned, Connolly?",
  "str_quest_chat_11842008": "Y-yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_11842009": "Maybe you're just able to see more of them, now that you're stronger?",
  "str_quest_chat_11842010": "It's fine, don't be scared!",
  "str_quest_chat_11842011": "Don't be afraid! You can see more of them because you've gotten stronger!",
  "str_quest_chat_11842012": "It's a good thing, I promise.",
  "str_quest_chat_11842013": "R... Really...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11842014": "That's right! Besides...",
  "str_quest_chat_11842015": "You ought to be used to them by now, right? What about Anton?",
  "str_quest_chat_11842016": "Anton... Is fine...",
  "str_quest_chat_11842017": "So just treat them the same way you would treat Anton, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_11842018": "O-Okay... Thank you...",
  "str_quest_chat_11851001": "Good morning... Did you sleep well last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_11851002": "Yeah, for the most part. Just a little hungry.",
  "str_quest_chat_11851003": "I-I could make you s-something to eat, then!",
  "str_quest_chat_11851004": "Really? That'd be great, thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_11851005": "I-It's nothing, don't mention it...!",
  "str_quest_chat_11852001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_11852002": "Good morning, Connolly! You're up early today.",
  "str_quest_chat_11852003": "Um... There's something I'd like to ask you...",
  "str_quest_chat_11852004": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11852005": "Today, when I was making coffee in my room...",
  "str_quest_chat_11852006": "I accidentally broke a whole bunch of cups!",
  "str_quest_chat_11852007": "I've seen those Fireflies... fix things before... So, those... those broken cups...",
  "str_quest_chat_11852008": "Can I just... just ask them to help, directly...?",
  "str_quest_chat_11852009": "Don't worry... Tell them what you want them to do, you will be fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_11852010": "Ah... I've never spoken to them before...",
  "str_quest_chat_11852011": "Thank you... I'll try...",
  "str_quest_chat_11853001": "PlayerName, don't drink too much coffee in the morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_11853002": "Yeah... I think I'm getting addicted to it...",
  "str_quest_chat_11853003": "But it's fine. It keeps my head clear.",
  "str_quest_chat_11853004": "It's better to have milk in the morning... It's healthier.",
  "str_quest_chat_11853005": "Especially for people your age...",
  "str_quest_chat_11853006": "You can still get taller...",
  "str_quest_chat_11853007": "I-I'm not short!",
  "str_quest_chat_11853008": "Right! I don't mean anything by it...",
  "str_quest_chat_11853009": "It's just that... It's healthier to have milk in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_11854001": "G-Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_11854002": "Good morning, Connolly.",
  "str_quest_chat_11854003": "So... I made a new flavor of coffee...",
  "str_quest_chat_11854004": "Would you mind trying it?",
  "str_quest_chat_11854005": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_11854006": "Great! I-I'd appreciate it if you could give me some feedback.",
  "str_quest_chat_11854007": "I'm looking forward to it!",
  "str_quest_chat_11854008": "Okay. I'll leave it at the door, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_11881001": "Wo-would you like some milk?",
  "str_quest_chat_11881002": "Oh, I was just thinking of having some milk before going to bed. You're so thoughtful!",
  "str_quest_chat_11881003": "Then... Please open the door...",
  "str_quest_chat_11881004": "That was fast!",
  "str_quest_chat_11881005": "I-it's because I just put the milk outside the room...",
  "str_quest_chat_11882001": "You looked... A bit exhausted just now...",
  "str_quest_chat_11882002": "Yeah, I've been busy all morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_11882003": "W-Would you like some coffee? It might help...",
  "str_quest_chat_11882004": "Sure, that sounds nice!",
  "str_quest_chat_11883001": "G-Good evening...",
  "str_quest_chat_11883002": "Good evening, Connolly. Are you getting ready to go to bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_11883003": "T-Today was a good day...",
  "str_quest_chat_11883004": "What happened today?",
  "str_quest_chat_11883005": "The lights in my room... They broke...",
  "str_quest_chat_11883006": "My room... in the dark... for the whole day. Peaceful to stay.",
  "str_quest_chat_11883007": "...I'll fix the lights tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_11883008": "Is it... okay if you don't fix them?",

  "str_quest_chat_11963015": "Keep my share of the hot sauce away from everyone else's. I don't want to get involved with anyone over it.",
  "str_quest_chat_11963016": "Sure, sure...",

  "str_quest_chat_11982003": "He told me you'd been waiting for me by my door for a long time.",
  "str_quest_chat_11982004": "But when I hustled back, I didn't see you there.",

  "str_quest_chat_11984006": "Well, not many people are willing to talk to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_11984007": "I see... Maybe it's because everyone thinks you prefer being alone?",

  "str_quest_chat_12041008": "Listen up! The name's Regina, lead vocalist of the Rediesel Wrench's metal band, and the greatest musician in all of Astra!",
  "str_quest_chat_12041009": "If you're ready to rock, look no further! Especially not at Barbara...",
  "str_quest_chat_12041010": "Who the heck is Barbara...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12041011": "You don't know Barbara, either? That's perfect!",
  "str_quest_chat_12041012": "You'll be fine, as long as you know who I am! You can count on me for some REAL metal!",
  "str_quest_chat_12041013": "Right, okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_12041014": "So whaddya say? Think we can put together a stage for a show? The top of this big fella would be perfect, I think!",
  "str_quest_chat_12041015": "On top of Soroz...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12041016": "What're you standing around for?! I'll be waiting at the top!",
  "str_quest_chat_12041017": "W-Wait, don't go up there! What if you fall off?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12041018": "Fall? Pfff, that'd be even MORE metal! I'll slam the ground hard enough to flip the whole damn continent!",
  "str_quest_chat_12041019": "H-Hey!!",
  "str_quest_chat_12061001": "Hey! Coming to my concert this afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_12061002": "N-no. I just had lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat_12061003": "You don't like my music?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12061004": "No, it's not that!",
  "str_quest_chat_12061005": "Then are you coming or not!",
  "str_quest_chat_12061006": "... It's a 14-hour concert... Have mercy on me!",
  "str_quest_chat_12062001": "It's high noon! Let's soak up some sun!",
  "str_quest_chat_12062002": "Isn't it supposed to be cloudy today?",
  "str_quest_chat_12062003": "As long as we keep the burning sun in our hearts, we can feel its heat any time of day...!",
  "str_quest_chat_12062004": "I got it, I got it! Keep it down, would you? The others are on their breaks...",
  "str_quest_chat_12063001": "My new album is done and dusted.",
  "str_quest_chat_12063002": "I've saved you one for old time's sake.",
  "str_quest_chat_12063003": "Oh, t-thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_12063004": "No probs.",
  "str_quest_chat_12063005": "It'd make my day if you could play it on the Colossus for three days and three nights.",
  "str_quest_chat_12063006": "That way, I'd show that big fool, Barbara, what real music is!",
  "str_quest_chat_12063007": "Be sure to crank it up to the highest volume!",
  "str_quest_chat_12063008": "If I were to do that...",
  "str_quest_chat_12063009": "All the windows on the Colossus will shatter!",
  "str_quest_chat_12064001": "I asked someone to buy some stuff from Umbraton recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_12064002": "You actually buy things from Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat_12064003": "You don't have to look so surprised.",
  "str_quest_chat_12064004": "What did you buy?",
  "str_quest_chat_12064005": "I heard there's a new music style that's been gaining popularity in Umbraton lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_12064006": "Ohh, so it's some kind of Umbraton album?",
  "str_quest_chat_12064007": "I wouldn't call it an album yet, but that's pretty close.",
  "str_quest_chat_12064008": "I was hoping the music would get me through the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_12064009": "Get you through? What if it doesn't?",
  "str_quest_chat_12064010": "Well, if it doesn't, it means they're not good enough. I'm gonna smash these discs if they're not up to snuff.",
  "str_quest_chat_12064011": "Right... I'll leave you to it then, Regina.",
  "str_quest_chat_12065001": "Got any cold drinks on the Colossus, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_12065002": "How about some iced coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat_12065003": "As long as it's cold.",
  "str_quest_chat_12065004": "How about some cold milk?",
  "str_quest_chat_12065005": "Anything cooler than that?",
  "str_quest_chat_12065006": "I'm not sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_12065007": "But you can check at the Cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_12065008": "Is there anything wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_12065009": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_12065010": "My throat is just parched from practicing songs all morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_12065011": "So that's why it was so noisy on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_12081001": "The concert is about to begin! What are you doing sleeping!?",
  "str_quest_chat_12081002": "Regina... Evening... I'm so sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_12081003": "Wait... You're having a concert on the Colossus right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_12081004": "Right! I'm rehearsing in my room for a major gig!",
  "str_quest_chat_12081005": "Hmm? You'd rather I rehearse in the corridor for you? My pleasure!",
  "str_quest_chat_12081006": "No, no, no... That's not what I meant...",
  "str_quest_chat_12081007": "I think metal music rehearsal is best kept in your room!",
  "str_quest_chat_12081008": "Rehearsing in your room... should make you feel more like a real artist!",
  "str_quest_chat_12081009": "Huh? How do you know I'm into metal? I guess my style gave it away!",
  "str_quest_chat_12081010": "Well, I'll carry on rehearsing in my room! As for you... You should go to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_12081011": "Goodnight, Regina!",
  "str_quest_chat_12082001": "What kind of music do you usually listen to before going to bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_12082002": "Umm... I don't usually listen to music before going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_12082003": "Because I always fall asleep as soon as I'm done with my work...",
  "str_quest_chat_12082004": "Huh?! What do you mean you don't listen to death metal every night!?",
  "str_quest_chat_12082005": "If I did that, I'd never sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_12082006": "Your taste is different from what I expected!",
  "str_quest_chat_12082007": "Your preference really has no equal...",
  "str_quest_chat_12083001": "I heard that you're curious about how I sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_12083002": "I am a little curious, actually.",
  "str_quest_chat_12083003": "Regina's hair always seems to be aflame...",
  "str_quest_chat_12083004": "Pathetic.",
  "str_quest_chat_12083005": "No, I'm not the nosey type.",
  "str_quest_chat_12083006": "That's more like it.",
  "str_quest_chat_12083007": "I only have one thing to say about that.",
  "str_quest_chat_12083008": "How metal musicians sleep is none of your business!",
  "str_quest_chat_12083009": "... That's fire!",
  "str_quest_chat_12083010": "Of course, that's the metal way!",
  "str_quest_chat_12084001": "I'm gonna turn in early today.",
  "str_quest_chat_12084002": "Ohh, why?",
  "str_quest_chat_12084003": "No reason in particular.",
  "str_quest_chat_12084004": "I just decided to rest earlier today.",
  "str_quest_chat_12084005": "As expected, I guess musicians are free-spirited.",
  "str_quest_chat_12084006": "Night then.",
  "str_quest_chat_12084007": "Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_12101001": "PlayerName, what do you think after using the Regina Extreme Death Rock Wake-Up Call Device?",
  "str_quest_chat_12101002": "I'm awake. I'm awake for real this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_12101003": "Indeed, my invention shows immediate results.",
  "str_quest_chat_12101004": "I even asked Odi to mix Regina and Barbara's voices, and the results were outstanding.",
  "str_quest_chat_12101005": "Actually, I'm still a little sleepy right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_12101006": "In other words, there's still room for optimization for this invention, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_12101007": "Would you like to add the roar of Eclipsites?... I'm sure it'll sound real friendly.",
  "str_quest_chat_12101008": "But this time I've made an even more stunning new product than this!",
  "str_quest_chat_12101009": "It's called...",
  "str_quest_chat_12101010": "Meet me at the <color=#FFB400>Bar</color>, then I'll tell you. Remember, the <color=#FFB400>Bar</color>. See you there!",
  "str_quest_chat_12101999": "Rather than making a new invention, the top priority is to pull Tiny One out of the Bar. Minors aren't allowed in the bar even if they are only going to drink milk!",
  "str_quest_chat_12151001": "I just wanted to see if you're awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_12151002": "Is that you, Tiny One? Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_12151003": "Did you come to drag me out of bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_12151004": "No, but... it looks like you slept for too long again, didn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_12151005": "Oh, I get it. You don't like the morning glare, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_12151006": "Heh, then I'll take down all the lighting fixtures on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_12151007": "Stop...! Wait, come back! I'm awake!",
  "str_quest_chat_12152001": "PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_12152002": "Hey, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_12152003": "Still sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_12152004": "No, I'm up!",
  "str_quest_chat_12152005": "Oh, so you're up. Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_12152006": "It's still so early. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_12152007": "Regina and Barbara are going to hold a Fiery Support concert on the Colossus, and I've already set up the lighting and venue. So, be sure to come and join us!",
  "str_quest_chat_12152008": "Huh?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12152009": "Wait a sec, let me open all the windows on the Colossus first!",
  "str_quest_chat_12152010": "Why'd you do that for?",
  "str_quest_chat_12152011": "Prevent them from being shattered, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_12153001": "Are you there, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_12153002": "What's up, Tiny One?",
  "str_quest_chat_12153003": "To end your habit of oversleeping, I made a little something for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_12153004": "Is it an alarm clock?",
  "str_quest_chat_12153005": "Is it a bomb?",
  "str_quest_chat_12153006": "It's a table lamp!",
  "str_quest_chat_12153007": "Table lamp? Will that work?",
  "str_quest_chat_12153008": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_12153009": "It has a timer.",
  "str_quest_chat_12153010": "When it's time for you to get up, it lights up brighter than a laser beam.",
  "str_quest_chat_12153011": "You wouldn't be able to keep sleeping even if you wanted to, guaranteed!",
  "str_quest_chat_12153012": "Uh... Why don't you keep it for yourself instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_12154001": "Hey, wake up!",
  "str_quest_chat_12154002": "It's still so early. Is something the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_12154003": "Why are my breakfast utensils different from other people's?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12154004": "Haha, you noticed?",
  "str_quest_chat_12154005": "They're made just for kids! Cute, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_12154006": "I hear those would help make mealtime fun for children too!",
  "str_quest_chat_12154007": "... Let me say this one last time.",
  "str_quest_chat_12154008": "I AM NOT A CHILD!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_12154009": "I, don't need plates with ears, no matter how cute they look! Now take them back and give me normal utensils!",
  "str_quest_chat_12154010": "OK, fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_12154011": "If you don't use them, I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_12154012": "Sigh...",
  "str_quest_chat_12154013": "What's so bad about these anyway...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12154014": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_12154015": "Uh... B-Breakfast was delicious, by the way.",
  "str_quest_chat_12154016": "Thanks for the food.",
  "str_quest_chat_12155001": "Can you receive my message...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12155002": "I can.",
  "str_quest_chat_12155003": "Aha! I knew it would work!",
  "str_quest_chat_12155004": "Of course it works. The communication systems aboard the Colossus are pretty good, aren't they?",
  "str_quest_chat_12155005": "Absolutely! Which is why I took mine apart to study it!",
  "str_quest_chat_12155006": "Huh?!?",
  "str_quest_chat_12155007": "Oh, relax.",
  "str_quest_chat_12155008": "If you're getting my messages, it means I was able to put it back together, good as new!",
  "str_quest_chat_12155009": "You could at least tell me before you do something like that...",
  "str_quest_chat_12156001": "You awake yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_12156002": "Yeah, I've been awake for a while now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12156003": "Huh. Never took you for an early riser.",
  "str_quest_chat_12156004": "It's not that early anymore...",
  "str_quest_chat_12156005": "I'm up, I swear!",
  "str_quest_chat_12156006": "Huh? Oh, don't worry about it! You can go back to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_12156007": "Alright, I'm out of bed now!",
  "str_quest_chat_12156008": "Anyway, do you need something?",
  "str_quest_chat_12156009": "Not really. I made a bet with someone to see if you were awake or not.",
  "str_quest_chat_12156010": "Looks like I lost this time...",
  "str_quest_chat_12156011": "What kind of person do you guys think I am...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12201001": "I heard you have trouble sleeping lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_12201002": "That...I guess I've been a little too tensed lately...",
  "str_quest_chat_12201003": "Hmm... Would you like me to tell you a new story I wrote recently? A bedtime story always helps with sleeping!",
  "str_quest_chat_12201004": "I'm already a grown up. Listening to fairy tales is a bit...",
  "str_quest_chat_12201005": "Even though it's a little strange, there's no harm in trying.",
  "str_quest_chat_12201006": "Fairy tales are not only for kids?",
  "str_quest_chat_12201007": "Just relax and leave everything to me!",
  "str_quest_chat_12201008": "Then I'll come to you now!",
  "str_quest_chat_12201009": "You're at the <color=#FFB400>lounge</color>, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_12201999": "It's rare for Louise to be so thoughtful, so you should probably wait for her in the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat_12202001": "PlayerName! I'm currently working on a new story!",
  "str_quest_chat_12202002": "Do you want to hear it? Will you?",
  "str_quest_chat_12202003": "Sure, sure, go ahead.",
  "str_quest_chat_12202004": "Once upon a time, there was a large white dragon...",
  "str_quest_chat_12202005": "Whose back sat a young knight!",
  "str_quest_chat_12202006": "Is this a story about a knight?",
  "str_quest_chat_12202007": "You can guess. I'm sure you'll be able to get it right!",
  "str_quest_chat_12202008": "Why does it sound a little familiar?",
  "str_quest_chat_12202009": "It should of course sound familiar to you. This story is based on a certain person!",
  "str_quest_chat_12202010": "Carry on then. I'll keep listening.",
  "str_quest_chat_12202011": "White roses were on the left side of the young knight while yellow daisies were on the right.",
  "str_quest_chat_12202012": "Why does it sound a little strange?",
  "str_quest_chat_12202013": "All sorts of flowers were behind the young knight.",
  "str_quest_chat_12202014": "Is this story heading towards a weird direction?",
  "str_quest_chat_12202015": "Which flower will you choose?",
  "str_quest_chat_12202016": "You're asking me questions now?",
  "str_quest_chat_12202017": "I don't know which one to pick.",
  "str_quest_chat_12202018": "An unexpected dilemma has occurred, but I guess it's expected.",
  "str_quest_chat_12202019": "Even I would be troubled if I had so many flowers.",
  "str_quest_chat_12202020": "Can't I choose them all?",
  "str_quest_chat_12202021": "Your answer surprises me! You're wiser than I thought!",
  "str_quest_chat_12202022": "I see, if I had so many flowers, I would want them all as well, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_12202023": "Yes, that's the case if we're only talking about flowers!",
  "str_quest_chat_12202024": "Of course! This is a story about flowers and nothing more!",
  "str_quest_chat_12202025": "It looks like I'll need to make some improvements to this story. I'll show it to you again when I finish writing the next page!",
  "str_quest_chat_12241001": "Hello, Navigator! My name is Louise!",
  "str_quest_chat_12241002": "Hi there! The others have told me about you, Miss Louise; what stories do you have for us today?",
  "str_quest_chat_12241003": "This time... My little brown friend didn't prepare anything this time! Sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat_12241004": "Buuuuut... I could make some cute little boxes for everyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_12241005": "\"Cute little boxes\"... What are they for?",
  "str_quest_chat_12241006": "For looking cute, obviously!",
  "str_quest_chat_12241007": "Nothing else besides that, although I'm sure those kids would love them all the same!",
  "str_quest_chat_12241008": "K-Kids...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12241009": "Even though you're not a little kid anymore, I'm sure you'd like one too, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_12241010": "So they're just boxes, huh...",
  "str_quest_chat_12241011": "Even so, I'm sure you'd like one, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_12241012": "Y-Yeah, sure. Thanks again...",
  "str_quest_chat_12251001": "Ooooooh, Navigator! I brought you some breakfast!",
  "str_quest_chat_12251002": "Huh? You mean...",
  "str_quest_chat_12251003": "I left it in front of your door. Enjoy!",
  "str_quest_chat_12251004": "Oh, okay. Thank you, Louise.",
  "str_quest_chat_12252001": "Ugh, I was up all night telling stories. I'm beat...",
  "str_quest_chat_12252002": "Yeah, I'm a little tired, too...",
  "str_quest_chat_12252003": "Let's go for a walk, Navigator! That ought to wake us up!",
  "str_quest_chat_12252004": "Sure, although sleeping a little longer is fine, too...",
  "str_quest_chat_12253001": "Morning! Morning! Morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_12253002": "How are you feeling? I'm feeling amazing!",
  "str_quest_chat_12253003": "Morning... It's a rare sight to see you up so early.",
  "str_quest_chat_12253004": "That's because I just built a strawberry, cherry, and cotton candy house!",
  "str_quest_chat_12253005": "I bet you can't even look at it without drooling!",
  "str_quest_chat_12253006": "Wanna try it? Your tongue might get stuck while eating it, but it's still delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_12253007": "Oh, I see. Thank you, Louise...",
  "str_quest_chat_12253008": "But if my tongue will get stuck, perhaps I'll pass...",
  "str_quest_chat_12254001": "Navigator, do you want to listen to a story?",
  "str_quest_chat_12254002": "I... just started on the plans for today...",
  "str_quest_chat_12254003": "Well... why not?",
  "str_quest_chat_12254004": "It's short. A long time ago, there was a piglet...",
  "str_quest_chat_12254005": "It wanted to build a house, but couldn't decide to build it with hay, wood, or stones...",
  "str_quest_chat_12254006": "In the end, it went with stones and defeated the big bad wolf.",
  "str_quest_chat_12254007": "How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_12254008": "You told me the same story a few days ago...",
  "str_quest_chat_12254009": "I see... I'll go come up with a new story then.",
  "str_quest_chat_12255001": "Hmmm... Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_12255002": "Yawn... Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_12255003": "Oh? Are you just getting out of bed, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_12255004": "Haven't you heard that famous saying before?",
  "str_quest_chat_12255005": "\"The early bird gets the worm!\"",
  "str_quest_chat_12255006": "You know, I gotta say...",
  "str_quest_chat_12255007": "If the worm didn't wake up so early, the early bird wouldn't get it... Know what I mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_12255008": "Oh...",
  "str_quest_chat_12255009": "Oh no! You're absolutely right! I wouldn't want the lovely little worms to get eaten, after all!",
  "str_quest_chat_12255010": "... So I'll play the worm, then?",
  "str_quest_chat_12255011": "In that case, a little more sleep won't hurt me. In fact, it'll keep the early bird away even longer!",
  "str_quest_chat_12255012": "Yeah! That's a great idea!",
  "str_quest_chat_12261001": "Do I just have to eat more if I want to grow taller?",
  "str_quest_chat_12261002": "Hmm... You'll need to eat more and get more sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_12261003": "But you're not very tall even though you sleep a lot...",
  "str_quest_chat_12261004": "Uh, what?",
  "str_quest_chat_12262001": "Wanna come to my party?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12262002": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_12262003": "You promised. I'll see you at 11pm then!",
  "str_quest_chat_12262004": "Why so late...",
  "str_quest_chat_12262005": "My sister said I'll meet companions I've never seen before if it's late at night. I want to play with them!",
  "str_quest_chat_12262006": "... I'm not going anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_12263001": "Her Majesty says you shouldn't eat too much candy at lunchtime...",
  "str_quest_chat_12263002": "Hmm... So I'll just give you some, okay? Do you like candy?",
  "str_quest_chat_12263003": "Well, I don't mind a little candy once in a while.",
  "str_quest_chat_12263004": "What do you wanna do when you finish your candy? Wanna play with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_12263005": "Sorry, Louise... I have to work this afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_12263006": "Oh... I guess you are the Navigator, after all. You're always busy, busy, busy!",
  "str_quest_chat_12263007": "Next time you have time to play, remember to call me!",
  "str_quest_chat_12263008": "Sure thing!",
  "str_quest_chat_12264001": "Good afternoon, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_12264002": "This is my favoritist time of day!",
  "str_quest_chat_12264003": "Oh? Why is that? Is it because the lunch is delicious?",
  "str_quest_chat_12264004": "That's one of the reasons, yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_12264005": "The other is I get to have a sweet Lumowhistler afterward!",
  "str_quest_chat_12264006": "Ah, candy, of course...",
  "str_quest_chat_12264007": "Not just any candy, but a special candy!",
  "str_quest_chat_12264008": "You can whistle with it! It's awesome... You should try it next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_12264009": "Hmm, it sounds really familiar...",
  "str_quest_chat_12264010": "I'll try it. Thank you, Louise.",
  "str_quest_chat_12264011": "I hope you'll like it as much as I do!",
  "str_quest_chat_12265001": "I brought some candy to share with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_12265002": "Thanks, Louise!",
  "str_quest_chat_12265003": "But don't you think you've given me a lot lately...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12265004": "Huh? You think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_12265005": "In that case, remember to save the wrappers and give them back to me, okay PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_12265006": "I want to make some crafts out of them!",
  "str_quest_chat_12265007": "I thought you loved sweets too, Louise? Why don't you just eat the candy yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_12265008": "Well, it's not like I can't finish them all by myself...",
  "str_quest_chat_12265009": "But Her Majesty told me to stop eating so much candy all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_12265010": "I'm a good girl, so I have to do as I'm told... Which is why I'm trusting you to finish the job, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_12265011": "But I can't eat ten whole boxes of candy by myself...",
  "str_quest_chat_12281001": "You still there, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_12281002": "Yeah, I'm still awake. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_12281003": "C-Could you please tell me a story? Just a short one!",
  "str_quest_chat_12281004": "Sure. I could use a quick break, anyways.",
  "str_quest_chat_12282001": "Navigator, are you still up...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12282002": "I must've napped too long earlier today. I don't feel sleepy at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_12282003": "Your body still needs rest, Navigator. Try to go to bed a little earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_12282004": "Sure thing, Louise.",
  "str_quest_chat_12282005": "I'll be waking you up first thing in the morning, don't forget!",
  "str_quest_chat_12283001": "Hmm, I can't sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_12283002": "Navigator, do you have any little tips to help me get to sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_12283003": "Well, in your case, Louise...",
  "str_quest_chat_12283004": "How about counting all your favorite flavors of candy in your head?",
  "str_quest_chat_12283005": "Yeah! That might just work!",
  "str_quest_chat_12283006": "Thanks, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_12283007": "Chocolate... strawberry... cotton candy... peppermint... hazelnut...",
  "str_quest_chat_12284001": "Vice just gave me a piece of coffee candy!",
  "str_quest_chat_12284002": "How was it, good?",
  "str_quest_chat_12284003": "A bit bitter, but still very sweet!",
  "str_quest_chat_12284004": "I liked it a lot!",
  "str_quest_chat_12284005": "That's good to hear.",
  "str_quest_chat_12284006": "Just remember to brush your teeth before going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_12284007": "I will!",
  "str_quest_chat_12285001": "Hey there!",
  "str_quest_chat_12285002": "Hey Louise. It's a little late, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_12285003": "Hahaha, I knew you'd be awake, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_12285004": "Would you like me to read you a few bedtime stories?",
  "str_quest_chat_12285005": "I've written tons of new ones lately!",
  "str_quest_chat_12285006": "That sounds great!",
  "str_quest_chat_12285007": "Well, I have been having trouble sleeping...",
  "str_quest_chat_12285008": "Maybe I should give your bedtime stories a chance?",
  "str_quest_chat_12285009": "Perfect! I already took the liberty of recording my stories on the Fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat_12285010": "Sounds good, I'll go listen to them in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat_12285011": "No thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_12285012": "I'm a little too old for bedtime stories, sorry. I can fall asleep all on my own.",
  "str_quest_chat_12285013": "But I already went to the trouble of recording my stories on the Fireflies...",
  "str_quest_chat_12285014": "Oh, alright... I'll go listen to them in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat_12285015": "Awesome!",
  "str_quest_chat_12285016": "Remember to tell me what you think once you're done!",
  "str_quest_chat_12301001": "Looking for me?",
  "str_quest_chat_12301002": "It's not a big deal...",
  "str_quest_chat_12301003": "Got it, let's talk when we meet.",
  "str_quest_chat_12301004": "I haven't said anything yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_12301005": "Well, in any case, I'll help if it's solvable, and if it's not, there's nothing I can do, really.",
  "str_quest_chat_12301006": "...As expected of you!",
  "str_quest_chat_12301007": "I just don't want to waste time here.",
  "str_quest_chat_12301008": "You have a point...",
  "str_quest_chat_12301009": "I'm at the <color=#FFB400>Cafe</color>, come look for me right away.",
  "str_quest_chat_12301010": "Remember to be neat.",
  "str_quest_chat_12301999": "Nikinis probably has a perfect solution for your problem, so don't worry about it. Go to the Cafe to meet her now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12302001": "PlayerName, do you know what a white tulip means in floriography?",
  "str_quest_chat_12302002": "Floriography? What's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_12302003": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_12302004": "I'm sorry, I really don't know...",
  "str_quest_chat_12302005": "Fine, I forgive you.",
  "str_quest_chat_12302006": "After all, you've lived alone for such a long time...",
  "str_quest_chat_12302007": "Why are you keeping quiet?",
  "str_quest_chat_12302008": "Sigh, as expected...",
  "str_quest_chat_12302009": "As expected?",
  "str_quest_chat_12302010": "I know you have lived alone for a long time, so there are probably many things you don't understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_12302011": "Let me tell you then.",
  "str_quest_chat_12302012": "Floriography refers to the meaning that has been attributed to flowers.",
  "str_quest_chat_12302013": "Then a white tulip symbolizes...",
  "str_quest_chat_12302014": "It's an Eternal Blessing.",
  "str_quest_chat_12302015": "Is that so... I really learned something.",
  "str_quest_chat_12302016": "Sometimes you should balance your knowledge and learn about arts and social sciences instead of just immersing yourself in science and engineering.",
  "str_quest_chat_12302017": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_12302018": "... Sigh, I might have given you a flower if you had answered me correctly...",
  "str_quest_chat_12341001": "Not surprised to see YOU here...",
  "str_quest_chat_12341002": "Ah, p-please, no need to be so cold! Especially since it's the first time we've met...",
  "str_quest_chat_12341003": "Fair enough, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat_12341004": "I can sense the perfunctory tone everywhere...",
  "str_quest_chat_12341005": "I am Nikinis, guardian of Lake Mirror. The person in the mirror is my older sister.",
  "str_quest_chat_12341006": "There, satisfied now?",
  "str_quest_chat_12341007": "I-In the mirror...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12341008": "Yes, the girl in the mirror.",
  "str_quest_chat_12341009": "There's... someone in the mirror?",
  "str_quest_chat_12341010": "Your sister...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12341011": "Correct. My sister lives in the mirror.",
  "str_quest_chat_12341012": "H-How could someone live in a mirror?",
  "str_quest_chat_12341013": "How was I unclear in any way? Don't make me say it a third time...",
  "str_quest_chat_12341014": "Sorry! My bad... Everything is crystal clear now!",
  "str_quest_chat_12341015": "If that's the case, then take me to my room. I require rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_12341016": "Right away...!",
  "str_quest_chat_12342001": "Is this the power I seek? It's nothing like what I imagined...",
  "str_quest_chat_12342002": "What did you imagine...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12342003": "I was expecting... Something stronger...",
  "str_quest_chat_12342004": "Strong enough to help my sister escape the mirror.",
  "str_quest_chat_12342005": "But you're already very strong, Nikinis!",
  "str_quest_chat_12342006": "Not enough... I need to be even stronger if I want to see my sister again.",
  "str_quest_chat_12342007": "Sorry if I'm being rude by asking, Nikinis, but I'm still very curious. Your sister...",
  "str_quest_chat_12342008": "What do you mean when you say she lives on the other side of the mirror?",
  "str_quest_chat_12342009": "It's a curse. My sister has been sealed away inside the mirror.",
  "str_quest_chat_12342010": "But someday, I'm certain we will be reunited.",
  "str_quest_chat_12342011": "I'm certain of it, too! I look forward to meeting her!",
  "str_quest_chat_12342012": "I can't believe I accidentally let you console me like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_12342013": "Don't you dare look down on me!",
  "str_quest_chat_12342014": "In any case, I should thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_12361001": "Shall we spend this afternoon together...",
  "str_quest_chat_12361002": "Hmm? What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_12361003": "You don't have anything better to do now anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_12361004": "... Does lunch count?",
  "str_quest_chat_12361005": "What I mean is...",
  "str_quest_chat_12361006": "Is...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12361007": "Forget it. It isn't important.",
  "str_quest_chat_12361008": "???",
  "str_quest_chat_12362001": "The flowers I sent you... Are you taking good care of them?",
  "str_quest_chat_12362002": "Yeah, I water them every day, just like you showed me.",
  "str_quest_chat_12362003": "Glad to hear it. I have a few more things lying around here somewhere...",
  "str_quest_chat_12362004": "You call this \"a few more things\"?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12363001": "Did you take a look in the mirror today?",
  "str_quest_chat_12363002": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_12363003": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_12363004": "I saw you just a while ago, and you feel really different.",
  "str_quest_chat_12363005": "I thought you groomed yourself in front of a mirror after lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_12363006": "Thinking back... I did wash my face and blew my hair.",
  "str_quest_chat_12363007": "I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat_12364001": "It's noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_12364002": "It is. What're you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_12364003": "Enjoying the flowers. There's nothing more relaxing than fragrant blooms.",
  "str_quest_chat_12364004": "How are those flowers I gave you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_12364005": "I was just about to water them.",
  "str_quest_chat_12364006": "You can't.",
  "str_quest_chat_12364007": "Delicate blooms can be damaged by over-watering.",
  "str_quest_chat_12364008": "Oh. Then I'll do it later.",
  "str_quest_chat_12381001": "Good evening... Seems like you haven't rested yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_12381002": "Good evening, Nikinis.",
  "str_quest_chat_12381003": "Not yet, do you need anything?",
  "str_quest_chat_12381004": "The Colossus is so dry at night...",
  "str_quest_chat_12381005": "My skin, my lips... they're losing moistness... I can practically feel the wrinkles forming.",
  "str_quest_chat_12381006": "...Sis would feel the same, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_12381007": "So... Could you please send more Fireflies to keep my room at a reasonable humidity?",
  "str_quest_chat_12381008": "Of course, if it's not convenient for you, just forget it about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_12381009": "I don't think anyone's ever brought this up before...",
  "str_quest_chat_12381010": "So... Will it be a problem?",
  "str_quest_chat_12381011": "No, no, it's fine! I'll tell the Fireflies to come by.",
  "str_quest_chat_12381012": "Thank you... Sweet dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_12382001": "Where are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_12382002": "Good evening, Nikinis. I'm in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_12382003": "Is there anything I can do for you? You sound like...",
  "str_quest_chat_12382004": "The lilies I was going to give you have withered.",
  "str_quest_chat_12382005": "Whenever the Colossus lands or takes off, its internal temperature and humidity affect the flowers growing here.",
  "str_quest_chat_12382006": "According to my observations, this is the third time now. The lilies always wither at the night after the Colossus has landed or taken off.",
  "str_quest_chat_12382007": "...Uh, is there anything we can do about it?",
  "str_quest_chat_12382008": "...I'm just letting you know. I have nothing else to do right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12382009": "Sorry... I'll tell the Fireflies to take special care about this.",
  "str_quest_chat_12382010": "The temperature and humidity of the Colossus... Consider it's done.",
  "str_quest_chat_12382011": "Well, that's fine, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_12382012": "Goodbye, and rest well.",
  "str_quest_chat_12383001": "If you're heading to bed, don't worry about it...",
  "str_quest_chat_12383002": "Huh? Evening. I'm not heading to bed just yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_12383003": "What's wrong, Nikinis?",
  "str_quest_chat_12383004": "This is the first time I've ever felt like this...",
  "str_quest_chat_12383005": "Felt like what?",
  "str_quest_chat_12383006": "Hmm... The Colossus smells so clean today... and so comforting...",
  "str_quest_chat_12383007": "I'm quite sure it's not the scent of flowers, but somehow it's soothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_12383008": "I... I want to know what that smell is.",
  "str_quest_chat_12383009": "Ah... I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_12383010": "The Colossus went pass over a forest today.",
  "str_quest_chat_12383011": "I asked the Fireflies to open all the windows...",
  "str_quest_chat_12383012": "So... it's probably the smell of trees?",
  "str_quest_chat_12383013": "Indeed... It has been so long since I smelled the scent of nature...",
  "str_quest_chat_12383014": "Thank you. Sleeping amidst this natural aroma would be a nice experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_12383015": "Well then, please go to sleep early. I wish you dreams more beautiful than the finest flowers.",
  "str_quest_chat_12384001": "I'm going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_12384002": "Uh... Good night, I guess?",
  "str_quest_chat_12384003": "Are you asking a question?",
  "str_quest_chat_12384004": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_12384005": "No, it was more like etiquette.",
  "str_quest_chat_12384006": "I was just saying goodnight since you said you were going to bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_12384007": "Oh.",
  "str_quest_chat_12384008": "I thought you didn't like going to bed this early.",
  "str_quest_chat_12384009": "So if you'd like me to turn in later as well, I could probably do that.",
  "str_quest_chat_12384010": "No, that's not what I meant at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_12384011": "Actually, I'm getting ready for bed too, Nikinis.",
  "str_quest_chat_12384012": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_12384013": "Well, good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_12385001": "These flowers only bloom in the dead of night.",
  "str_quest_chat_12385002": "And only those who wait until then are able to enjoy their beauty.",
  "str_quest_chat_12385003": "And are you waiting for that, Nikinis?",
  "str_quest_chat_12385004": "Yes. My sister and I both want to see them at their most beautiful.",
  "str_quest_chat_12385005": "I hope you do!",
  "str_quest_chat_12401001": "PlayerName! PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_12401002": "What is it? What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_12401003": "I-I-I have something to ask you!",
  "str_quest_chat_12401004": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_12401005": "Come to the <color=#FFB400>Bridge</color>! I've made a discovery!",
  "str_quest_chat_12401999": "Raphael seems to have made a new discovery at the Bridge! Go see her now!",
  "str_quest_chat_12402001": "PlayerName, hello! Did you get hurt today?",
  "str_quest_chat_12402002": "... It's a little scary being greeted like this.",
  "str_quest_chat_12402003": "I'm sorry, I just wanted to try out the new Holy Water Shell I developed.",
  "str_quest_chat_12402004": "I also especially requested the City Lord of Schwartz to find me the best technician in the city to find a way to make it lighter.",
  "str_quest_chat_12402005": "Each shell only weighs 5 horse-carriages now!",
  "str_quest_chat_12402006": "I don't care how heavily wounded you are. As long as you're still breathing and can survive this shell...",
  "str_quest_chat_12402007": "I'd probably just die at the spot.",
  "str_quest_chat_12402008": "Hey! Are you questioning my medical skills?",
  "str_quest_chat_12402009": "I rather question your arm strength...",
  "str_quest_chat_12402010": "I'll probably be so touched that I'm on my knees.",
  "str_quest_chat_12402011": "On your knees? No, no, no, it's my duty to treat and heal. You don't have to thank me like that!",
  "str_quest_chat_12402012": "Oh? You think I'll be thanking you?",
  "str_quest_chat_12402013": "I mean, the shell weighs 5 horse-carriages! It's 5 horse-carriages! Even the Colossus would get smashed into a Colossus pancake if it gets hit by one of these!",
  "str_quest_chat_12402014": "Huh? The Colossus? Oh right... The Colossus is so big, so it should be able to take a few of my Holy Water Shells!",
  "str_quest_chat_12402015": "Okay, lock down on the Soroz, then aim—",
  "str_quest_chat_12402016": "What?! Soroz, rise into the air! Fly as far away as you can! Quickly!",
  "str_quest_chat_12402017": "Hey! No need to get all worked up... I was just joking! I don't even know how heavy the shell is...",
  "str_quest_chat_12402018": "So, PlayerName, why don't you help me find out?",
  "str_quest_chat_12402019": "Please spare me!",
  "str_quest_chat_12441001": "How do you do? Raphael, at your service!",
  "str_quest_chat_12441002": "Oh, my dear Navigator! Whenever you need treatment, I'll be at your beck and call!",
  "str_quest_chat_12441003": "T-Treatment, huh... You're a medic, I take it?",
  "str_quest_chat_12441004": "Bingo! The woman you see before you is one of the Four Angels of Lumopolis, the greatest healer and support in the land!",
  "str_quest_chat_12441005": "Then... Could I ask why you're carrying that giant missile around?",
  "str_quest_chat_12441006": "Oh? When it comes to healing and support, this is the great Raphael's secret weapon!",
  "str_quest_chat_12441007": "I see! So you use this missile to blast Eclipsites away first! Then your allies are safe, and you have a safe path to their position!",
  "str_quest_chat_12441008": "Hmm? What could you mean, Navigator? While I'm no novice at dispatching Eclipsites, I would only ever train my precious Holy Water Shells on my beloved teammates!",
  "str_quest_chat_12441009": "However, I do tend to fire it into the most heated areas of battle. That way, I can heal my precious comrades while also blasting away those nasty Eclipsites!",
  "str_quest_chat_12441010": "The great Raphael is absolutely brimming with cunning, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_12441011": "I-I agree! With you around, I feel much safer already!",
  "str_quest_chat_12441012": "Hmm! I don't blame you for wanting to lavish me with praise, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442001": "Oooooooh, my dear Navigator! I'm positively overjoyed today!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442002": "My body is bursting at the seams with power! Even my Holy Water Shell has grown stronger!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442003": "You've grown, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_12442004": "It makes me very happy that you're growing like this!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442005": "You have my thanks, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442006": "The great Raphael is poised and ready to help even more people now!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442007": "Great to hear!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442008": "I'm sure our allies will be just as excited as you about this, Raphael!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442009": "Hee-hee! Of course! I am everyone's guardian angel, after all! Leave it to me!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442010": "Whether it's my companions or those Eclipsites, there are enough Holy Water Shells to go around!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442011": "Well, even though getting hit by a missile still hurts... I can't deny the amazing healing effects...",
  "str_quest_chat_12442012": "It's a little unorthodox, but that's just your way of caring for everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat_12442013": "Ha-ha! Absolutely!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442014": "Besides, I'm sure everyone will want to praise you even more, now that you've gotten stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_12442015": "Really? You mean that? T-Then...!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442016": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_12442017": "You have to be the first to praise me, Navigator! No matter where you are, I'll always have a missile with your name on it!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442018": "H-Hang on...!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442019": "So you'd better sing my praises to the moon and back!",
  "str_quest_chat_12442020": "Waaaait!",
  "str_quest_chat_12461001": "You should rest up during noon, since the routine physical examination is in the afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_12461002": "What physical examination??",
  "str_quest_chat_12461003": "I've also only just decided!",
  "str_quest_chat_12461004": "... C-can I say no?",
  "str_quest_chat_12461005": "No! Your health issues are very important!",
  "str_quest_chat_12461006": "Help...!",
  "str_quest_chat_12462001": "I made lunch for you today!",
  "str_quest_chat_12462002": "Wow!",
  "str_quest_chat_12462003": "I even added a special Raphael health supplement!",
  "str_quest_chat_12462004": "?! Have you tried it yourself...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12462005": "No! You'll be the first to taste it!",
  "str_quest_chat_12462006": "Thank you, I guess...",
  "str_quest_chat_12463001": "Come take a look... Quickly!",
  "str_quest_chat_12463002": "Good afternoon, Raphael. What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_12463003": "I just did a leg!",
  "str_quest_chat_12463004": "Although... I did accidentally shave off all the hair on the patient's legs at the beginning of the treatment...",
  "str_quest_chat_12463005": "But I kept changing the subject and made sure the patient didn't find out!",
  "str_quest_chat_12463006": "Anyway, let's get back to the leg! Isn't that the smoothest leg you've ever seen?",
  "str_quest_chat_12463007": "Erm... Is this where I give complements?",
  "str_quest_chat_12463008": "You're supposed to say well done! Directly!",
  "str_quest_chat_12463009": "Umm... Well... Well done.",
  "str_quest_chat_12463010": "It would be better if there were no accident along the way, next time...",
  "str_quest_chat_12464001": "Hey, good afternoon! How was your lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_12464002": "Good afternoon, Raphael! I'm about to take an afternoon nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_12464003": "Whoa, whoa, whoa! An afternoon nap!? I know the perfect way to make sure you sleep like a baby!",
  "str_quest_chat_12464004": "I just learned how to induce hypnosis with my Holy Water Shell. You shall be the first one to experience it! Heehee!",
  "str_quest_chat_12464005": "Thank you! But there's really no need!",
  "str_quest_chat_12465001": "Navigator, could you lend me some fireflies?",
  "str_quest_chat_12465002": "What have you done?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12465003": "I need them to test my new missile. I won't hurt them!",
  "str_quest_chat_12465004": "The new missile has improved damage, but also improved healing!",
  "str_quest_chat_12465005": "Wait... Fireflies can't be healed by missiles...",
  "str_quest_chat_12465006": "But it doesn't matter! I will fix them!",
  "str_quest_chat_12465007": "It does matter!",
  "str_quest_chat_12466001": "By the way, does napping after lunch make you taller?",
  "str_quest_chat_12466002": "Not sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_12466003": "Some do say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_12466004": "Raphael, are you taking a nap?",
  "str_quest_chat_12466005": "Raphael?",
  "str_quest_chat_12466006": "Raphael!",
  "str_quest_chat_12466007": "Raphael...",
  "str_quest_chat_12466008": "I'm thinking about the nap!",
  "str_quest_chat_12466009": "I'm sorry to have disturbed you.",
  "str_quest_chat_12466010": "Well... Seems like not napping is the reason why I...",
  "str_quest_chat_12466011": "It's fine. You can still grow taller!",
  "str_quest_chat_12466012": "Thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_12467001": "I learned a lot this morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_12467002": "You can learn?",
  "str_quest_chat_12467003": "Hey, who do you think I am?",
  "str_quest_chat_12467004": "I read books too, sometimes, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_12467005": "Sorry... So, what kind of books?",
  "str_quest_chat_12467006": "What are they about?",
  "str_quest_chat_12467007": "Healing, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_12467008": "I got into it today and realized mental trauma should be treated, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_12467009": "True. So, can your missiles treat the mind?",
  "str_quest_chat_12467010": "Not right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_12467011": "But that's what I'm researching next!",
  "str_quest_chat_12467012": "Very admirable!",
  "str_quest_chat_12467013": "For better study...",
  "str_quest_chat_12467014": "I must take an afternoon nap now!",
  "str_quest_chat_12467015": "I'm starting to doubt your attitude toward research...",
  "str_quest_chat_12468001": "Hi, PlayerName. It's time for lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_12468002": "Are there any picky eaters?",
  "str_quest_chat_12468003": "I'm not sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_12468004": "I recently invented a \"balanced diet\" missile!",
  "str_quest_chat_12468005": "For the picky eaters, hehe...",
  "str_quest_chat_12468006": "One hit will blast them into balanced nutrition.",
  "str_quest_chat_12468007": "It sounds great, and it seems super easy to do...",
  "str_quest_chat_12468008": "Is it really that effective?",
  "str_quest_chat_12468009": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_12468010": "I've only tested it on myself...",
  "str_quest_chat_12468011": "... then why did you ask if there were any picky eaters?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12468012": "Raphael was just asking around!",
  "str_quest_chat_12469001": "In the afternoon, I'm teaching the students of Dawn Academy first aid techniques.",
  "str_quest_chat_12469002": "First aid is so important!",
  "str_quest_chat_12469003": "It's rarely needed but life-saving when it is.",
  "str_quest_chat_12469004": "Exactly! Would you like to join the class, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_12469005": "Then you'll be able to treat people's wounds when I'm not there to help!",
  "str_quest_chat_12469006": "That sounds good! Wait, I'll be right over.",
  "str_quest_chat_12470001": "It's so hot at noon!",
  "str_quest_chat_12470002": "Be careful, Navigator. You shouldn't spend too much time in the sun when it's this hot.",
  "str_quest_chat_12470003": "Why? I love sunbathing.",
  "str_quest_chat_12470004": "But you can faint if you overheat.",
  "str_quest_chat_12470005": "That's true... I've heard people can even faint if they get too hot.",
  "str_quest_chat_12470006": "Indeed! It's called heatstroke!",
  "str_quest_chat_12470007": "Oh, okay. Got it.",
  "str_quest_chat_12470008": "Thanks for the warning.",
  "str_quest_chat_12501001": "PlayerName, are you free recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_12501002": "Me? I guess I am. I'm going to check up on the Fireflies later...",
  "str_quest_chat_12501003": "Oh, then I won't get in your way.",
  "str_quest_chat_12501004": "Well... I'm leaving now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12501005": "I need you for something.",
  "str_quest_chat_12501006": "What is it? Right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_12501007": "Yes, come to the <color=#FFB400>Bridge</color>.",
  "str_quest_chat_12501008": "It's not too urgent, so I can do it another day. What do you need me for?",
  "str_quest_chat_12501009": "Oh? Actually, it isn't that important. I just want to find someone to idle with.",
  "str_quest_chat_12501010": "It sounds great. I'm feeling a little tired recently and feel like getting some rest too.",
  "str_quest_chat_12501011": "Come to the <color=#FFB400>Bridge</color> then!",
  "str_quest_chat_12501999": "It's quite rare for you to have free time. Gabriel has invited you to rest at the Bridge!",
  "str_quest_chat_12502001": "Oh! PlayerName, is everything going well at work recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_12502002": "Yeah, everything is going great.",
  "str_quest_chat_12502003": "I'm glad to hear that.",
  "str_quest_chat_12502004": "Yeah, I'm dealing with some problems right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12502005": "Don't let them stress you out. Maybe they'll be automatically resolved over the next few days.",
  "str_quest_chat_12502006": "... Oh, really?",
  "str_quest_chat_12502007": "Of course, everything will be fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_12502008": "I guess so...",
  "str_quest_chat_12502009": "PlayerName, feel free to come to me at any time if you have any problems at work.",
  "str_quest_chat_12502010": "Oh? Y-You want to listen to me in therapy?",
  "str_quest_chat_12502011": "Not really, all I do is help impatient people slow down.",
  "str_quest_chat_12502012": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_12502013": "Remember, you can come to me whenever!",
  "str_quest_chat_12541001": "Ah, the weather is beautiful today! Perfect for coming to see you!",
  "str_quest_chat_12541002": "I'm happy to see you, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_12541003": "Want to go to the cage and enjoy the sunlight?",
  "str_quest_chat_12541004": "It's great for your skin!",
  "str_quest_chat_12541005": "So you came out to sunbathe today, Gabriel?",
  "str_quest_chat_12541006": "That's right! I wouldn't have left my room if the weather wasn't so nice...",
  "str_quest_chat_12541007": "So what does nice weather have to do with coming to see me...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12541008": "Hee-hee... It has plenty to do with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_12541009": "If the weather is nice, I can sit in the Bird Cage and soak up the sunlight!",
  "str_quest_chat_12541010": "That... Doesn't answer my question...",
  "str_quest_chat_12541011": "If it's not nice, I wouldn't even leave my room!",
  "str_quest_chat_12541012": "See? The sunlight aboard the Colossus is so comfortable... Ahh...",
  "str_quest_chat_12541013": "If I knew it was this comfortable... *Yawns* I would take naps more often... Zzz...",
  "str_quest_chat_12541014": "N-Naps?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12541015": "You came on board... Just to take a nap?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12541016": "Ha-ha... Maybe... Zzzz...",
  "str_quest_chat_12541017": "There's no way she's asleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_12541018": "That was fast!",
  "str_quest_chat_12542001": "I can feel some memories coming back to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_12542002": "How strange...",
  "str_quest_chat_12542003": "Are they happy memories?",
  "str_quest_chat_12542004": "They don't seem to be.",
  "str_quest_chat_12542005": "These memories... There's no happiness or color in them. How gloomy...",
  "str_quest_chat_12542006": "Are they sad or painful memories?",
  "str_quest_chat_12542007": "I can't tell, either... These memories are so... Unclear.",
  "str_quest_chat_12542008": "I wouldn't be so calm if it wasn't for the Bird Cage...",
  "str_quest_chat_12542009": "I may not know anything about your painful past, Gabriel... but it's okay now! Everyone on Soroz is here for you, including me!",
  "str_quest_chat_12542010": "I may not be any good for fighting... but listening to other people's troubles is what I do best!",
  "str_quest_chat_12542011": "Hmm, that's so cute... Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_12542012": "But if you ask me, you're the one who needs protecting.",
  "str_quest_chat_12542013": "Hey, I'm not a total weakling, you know...",
  "str_quest_chat_12542014": "*Giggles* That's not what I meant. Anyway, just trust in me and everything will be okay!",
  "str_quest_chat_12542015": "*Yawns* Oh, all that talking made me sleepy again...",
  "str_quest_chat_12542016": "What, again?! G-Gabriel? Hello?",
  "str_quest_chat_12561001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12561002": "Hello, Gabriel.",
  "str_quest_chat_12561003": "Do you have any plans for the afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_12561004": "Nothing important, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_12561005": "Then come spend it with me!",
  "str_quest_chat_12562001": "The afternoon sun is so beautiful, today.",
  "str_quest_chat_12562002": "Good afternoon, Gabriel. You're awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_12562003": "So, you've already figured out my routine?",
  "str_quest_chat_12562004": "Yeah... It's hard not to notice...",
  "str_quest_chat_12562005": "Then, allow me to explain myself...",
  "str_quest_chat_12562006": "The weather is too good to sleep in. Sleepiness is for the rainy days.",
  "str_quest_chat_12562007": "But... This is not too bad, either... I'll just go ahead and..",
  "str_quest_chat_12562008": "You'll just go ahead and... fall asleep!?",
  "str_quest_chat_12562009": "So... sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_12562010": "Enjoy your nap, Gabriel...",
  "str_quest_chat_12563001": "Yum. Breakfast was so tasty.",
  "str_quest_chat_12563002": "It's noon! Have you just finished breakfast, Gabriel?",
  "str_quest_chat_12563003": "Yeah. I wanted super-soft bread.",
  "str_quest_chat_12563004": "But that means you have to let the bread prove for a long time.",
  "str_quest_chat_12563005": "So I just waited and drank barley tea.",
  "str_quest_chat_12563006": "And finally, it was done.",
  "str_quest_chat_12563007": "You're very patient...",
  "str_quest_chat_12581001": "I just woke up from my nap. I don't feel that sleepy now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12581002": "You sure can sleep... It's already night-time!",
  "str_quest_chat_12581003": "I can't help it. The bed feels too comfy.",
  "str_quest_chat_12581004": "But you won't be able to sleep at night then...",
  "str_quest_chat_12581005": "That's why I'm here to chat with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_12581006": "??? I, I'm gonna sleep first...",
  "str_quest_chat_12582001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12582002": "Good evening, or should we say \"good night\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_12582003": "Huh? It's that late already?",
  "str_quest_chat_12582004": "I suppose it doesn't matter. The night is young!",
  "str_quest_chat_12582005": "Your sleep schedule seems a little... Off.",
  "str_quest_chat_12583001": "Good evening. I had a good day today!",
  "str_quest_chat_12583002": "Good evening, Gabriel! What happened today?",
  "str_quest_chat_12583003": "I didn't work all day. I passed on my jobs for the others to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_12583004": "Ah... I wish every day will be as good as this.",
  "str_quest_chat_12583005": "What a life...",
  "str_quest_chat_12584001": "Good evening... Did you know, barley tea can really help you to relax.",
  "str_quest_chat_12584002": "Would you like to try some?",
  "str_quest_chat_12584003": "Is it really a good idea to drink tea so late at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_12584004": "It'll be fine. I've already gotten enough sleep during the daytime...",
  "str_quest_chat_12584005": "Now I can just spend the next couple of hours thinking about my plan for tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_12584006": "Well, I'm going to go to bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_12584007": "I'll probably have a lot of work to do tomorrow...",
  "str_quest_chat_12584008": "Oh, that's too bad! Well, good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_12584009": "Good night...",
  "str_quest_chat_12585001": "Huh... Well, it's night time.",
  "str_quest_chat_12585002": "It's time to... sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_12585003": "Feeling sleepy already, Gabriel?",
  "str_quest_chat_12585004": "Yes, I can't help it...",
  "str_quest_chat_12585005": "You always sleep early...",
  "str_quest_chat_12585006": "Because the Colossus is always...",
  "str_quest_chat_12585007": "So quiet...",
  "str_quest_chat_12585008": "And it's perfect for...",
  "str_quest_chat_12585009": "Sleeping...",
  "str_quest_chat_12585010": "Gabriel...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12585011": "Already fallen asleep, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_12585012": "Nights and sweet dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_12586001": "Ahh, look at the time!",
  "str_quest_chat_12586002": "That's right, Gabriel.",
  "str_quest_chat_12586003": "Evening, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_12586004": "Don't tell me you just woke up?",
  "str_quest_chat_12586005": "Whoops, you got me...",
  "str_quest_chat_12586006": "But, this won't affect my sleep later at all...",
  "str_quest_chat_12586007": "... What a peculiar sleep habit!",
  "str_quest_chat_12587001": "Oh, good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_12587002": "It's quiet this evening, as usual.",
  "str_quest_chat_12587003": "Quiet moments like this are ideal for sitting by the window and drinking barley tea.",
  "str_quest_chat_12587004": "For watching the stars and thinking about what tomorrow will bring.",
  "str_quest_chat_12587005": "And what are you doing tomorrow, Gabriel?",
  "str_quest_chat_12587006": "Taking a day off, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_12588001": "Oh, is that the time?",
  "str_quest_chat_12588002": "Are you going to bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_12588003": "No, I only just got up.",
  "str_quest_chat_12588004": "You just got up?",
  "str_quest_chat_12588005": "You guessed it!",
  "str_quest_chat_12588006": "The tea I had at lunchtime wasn't enough to keep me awake. I couldn't resist a little nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_12588007": "But I ended up sleeping until just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12588008": "Wow, you can sleep even after drinking tea? I wish I could sleep so easily.",
  "str_quest_chat_12601001": "Did you get the message?",
  "str_quest_chat_12601002": "Haven't thought of a reply yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_12601003": "Don't know how to reply?",
  "str_quest_chat_12601004": "Maybe you are still thinking.",
  "str_quest_chat_12601005": "We've sent so many messages.",
  "str_quest_chat_12601006": "After reading them all.",
  "str_quest_chat_12601007": "There will be no time to reply.",
  "str_quest_chat_12601008": "Maybe you are busy right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12601009": "Maybe you can't reply in time.",
  "str_quest_chat_12601010": "I can finally reply now!",
  "str_quest_chat_12601011": "You don't need to rush.",
  "str_quest_chat_12601012": "I really need to have a normal chat right now!",

  "str_quest_chat_12741002": "If I told you everything I say is a lie, would you believe me?",
  "str_quest_chat_12741003": "Of course not, if it was a lie.",
  "str_quest_chat_12741004": "Then, if I told you I was lying when I said that... Would you believe me then?",
  "str_quest_chat_12741005": "If you were lying when you said \"everything I say is a lie\"... I would believe you.",
  "str_quest_chat_12741006": "But what is say IS a lie, so if I say \"everything I say is a lie\", then I'm lying twice.",
  "str_quest_chat_12741007": "Then I... Won't believe you?",
  "str_quest_chat_12741008": "But if everything I say is a lie, and I say \"everything I say is a lie\", then is it still a lie?",
  "str_quest_chat_12741009": "I have no idea! Are you lying or not?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12741010": "We keep circling the answer!",
  "str_quest_chat_12741011": "Very good. You must know by now whether or not you can believe my words.",
  "str_quest_chat_12741012": "No, I don't!!",
  "str_quest_chat_12761001": "Good morning, you must be awake by now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12761002": "...It's already noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_12761003": "Oh? Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_12761004": "Your Colossus looks so perfect... The facilities are excellent here...",
  "str_quest_chat_12761005": "I wonder if it's suitable for deep-sea diving?",
  "str_quest_chat_12761006": "I haven't thought about it before... Probably not.",
  "str_quest_chat_12761007": "Wait... What's that sound?",
  "str_quest_chat_12761008": "The Fireflies are reporting a problem with the drainage system!",
  "str_quest_chat_12761009": "Hmm? That really sounds quite terrible.",
  "str_quest_chat_12761010": "The Colossus must have encountered some trouble, eh? Now, we're all going to sink along with it...",
  "str_quest_chat_12761011": "...Kleken, you were trying to stall me just now?",
  "str_quest_chat_12761012": "Is that why you messaged me!?",
  "str_quest_chat_12761013": "Gah... I'd better solve this problem first.",
  "str_quest_chat_12761014": "Now, this is what mornings are made of... Hope you'll enjoy.",
  "str_quest_chat_12762001": "The sun has just reached its zenith.",
  "str_quest_chat_12762002": "...You're actually right, for once.",
  "str_quest_chat_12762003": "Noble Navigator, did you know that I never eat lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_12762004": "I didn't know that... This is just another lie, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_12762005": "Really! How could you suggest such a thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_12762006": "You see, because I never eat exactly at lunchtime, it can't be called lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_12762007": "...What kind of weird eating habits do you have, then!?",
  "str_quest_chat_12763001": "It's raining. What a perfect day to go out.",
  "str_quest_chat_12763002": "Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_12763003": "I see... What a brave Navigator, not afraid of a little storm.",
  "str_quest_chat_12763004": "I think it's better to stay indoors...",
  "str_quest_chat_12763005": "Stay in, so one can recharge for the journeys ahead.",
  "str_quest_chat_12763006": "Are you lying again?",
  "str_quest_chat_12763007": "Of course not.",
  "str_quest_chat_12764001": "Oh, you sweet, little Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_12764002": "Still working at this hour?",
  "str_quest_chat_12764003": "Is it really that late?",
  "str_quest_chat_12764004": "Man, time sure does fly when you're busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_12764005": "A true gentleman would never overexert himself.",
  "str_quest_chat_12764006": "You know, it's not too late to exchange good nights, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_12764007": "Sure. Good ni—Huh? Wait a minute...",
  "str_quest_chat_12764008": "It's still daytime outside!",
  "str_quest_chat_12764009": "Hahaha! As gullible as ever, my dear PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12764010": "Speaking with you is always so much fun. Until next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_12764011": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_12781001": "The creature from the deep-sea is watching you...",
  "str_quest_chat_12781002": "Noble Navigator... Are you aware of the potential crisis brewing at this very moment?",
  "str_quest_chat_12781003": "Good evening, Kleken...",
  "str_quest_chat_12781004": "What kind of wicked prank are you cooking up tonight?",
  "str_quest_chat_12781005": "Noble Navigator, what I have in store for you tonight is far more terrifying than a prank...",
  "str_quest_chat_12781006": "The dark, serene depths of the ocean... The most peaceful slumber...",
  "str_quest_chat_12781007": "Sleep... Sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_12781008": "I haven't noticed anything suspicious today...",
  "str_quest_chat_12781009": "That was actually just a lullaby, Brave Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_12781010": "An excerpt from An Adventurer's Voyage.",
  "str_quest_chat_12781011": "Uh... So, you were actually just saying good night?",
  "str_quest_chat_12781012": "Of course not.",
  "str_quest_chat_12782001": "The sun is rising.",
  "str_quest_chat_12782002": "...It's night time.",
  "str_quest_chat_12782003": "The sun is rising...",
  "str_quest_chat_12782004": "It just needs a little more time.",
  "str_quest_chat_12782005": "Do you consider this to be a lie?",
  "str_quest_chat_12782006": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_12782007": "When it comes to time, accuracy is something you actually need to pay attention to...",
  "str_quest_chat_12782008": "I guess it doesn't count.",
  "str_quest_chat_12782009": "Compared to your usual lies...",
  "str_quest_chat_12782010": "Of course, Noble Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_12782011": "Perhaps this is, in fact, a great prophecy. Who can deny it to be true?",
  "str_quest_chat_12782012": "And now, my second prophecy for tonight... I foretell that you will be going to sleep soon.",
  "str_quest_chat_12782013": "You call that a prophecy!?",
  "str_quest_chat_12782014": "Will my prophecy be proven wrong? Are you willing to deny its veracity?",
  "str_quest_chat_12782015": "... Never mind. Your prophecy was right.",
  "str_quest_chat_12782016": "I'm going to bed. Good night, Kleken.",
  "str_quest_chat_12782017": "Good night, Noble Navigator. May the deep sea watch over you.",
  "str_quest_chat_12783001": "PlayerName, if you had to choose...",
  "str_quest_chat_12783002": "Would you choose him or me?",
  "str_quest_chat_12783003": "You... or him... for what?",
  "str_quest_chat_12783004": "So you won't choose?",
  "str_quest_chat_12783005": "Choose from what!?",
  "str_quest_chat_12783006": "Looks like... our main protagonist won't decide who gets to stay on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_12783007": "W-Wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_12783008": "Then I'll do it!",
  "str_quest_chat_12783009": "W-What are you doing!?",
  "str_quest_chat_12783010": "Decide who gets to stay on the Colossus, and who doesn't.",
  "str_quest_chat_12783011": "Why? There are lots of rooms on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_12783012": "Everyone can stay.",
  "str_quest_chat_12783013": "But... There is no special room on Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_12783014": "What special room?",
  "str_quest_chat_12783015": "A room with taste and elegance for someone as noble as me...",
  "str_quest_chat_12783016": "I... I'll see what I can do.",
  "str_quest_chat_12783017": "Thanks for your hospitality, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12783018": "Wait a second. This is what the whole thing's about, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_12784001": "Good evening, adorable warrior.",
  "str_quest_chat_12784002": "Good evening, Kleken...",
  "str_quest_chat_12784003": "There're... quite a lot of people in this world who are more candid than me.",
  "str_quest_chat_12784004": "Give me a minute to process this...",
  "str_quest_chat_12784005": "What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_12784006": "I'm sure you understand what I'm saying, clever warrior.",
  "str_quest_chat_12784007": "Ah!",
  "str_quest_chat_12784008": "You're saying there're a lot of hypocrites out there, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_12784009": "You are smart, warrior.",
  "str_quest_chat_12784010": "Yeah, I think that's why you're so popular, Kleken.",
  "str_quest_chat_12784011": "Wrapping pretense in sincerity and wrapping sincerity in pretense...",
  "str_quest_chat_12784012": "They give off different feelings.",
  "str_quest_chat_12784013": "I don't want that kind of compliment, warrior.",
  "str_quest_chat_12784014": "You think that's a compliment?",
  "str_quest_chat_12784015": "Maybe I'm just deceiving you.",
  "str_quest_chat_12784016": "Oh, adorable warrior... You've learnt to be naughty.",
  "str_quest_chat_12784017": "Enjoy the night.",
  "str_quest_chat_12784018": "Yeah. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_12785001": "My, it's gotten quite late, hasn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_12785002": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_12785003": "Quit lying.",
  "str_quest_chat_12785004": "My dear Navigator, forcing myself to be honest with you is no easy feat.",
  "str_quest_chat_12785005": "You think that's not easy? Try having to be careful of every single word you say, Kleken!",
  "str_quest_chat_12785006": "It's definitely still daytime.",
  "str_quest_chat_12785007": "Hahaha! Right again!",
  "str_quest_chat_12785008": "\"The best lies don't need a scam artist to tell them.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_12785009": "I could read that line in \"An Adventurer's Voyage\" a thousand times, and never get tired of it...",
  "str_quest_chat_12785010": "Wait... What do you mean by that?",
  "str_quest_chat_12785011": "Is it really late now?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12801001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_12801002": "What's up? You look like you're in a rush!",
  "str_quest_chat_12801003": "Yep! It's because I'm busy! Are you free right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_12801004": "Ah, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_12801005": "Come to the <color=#FFB400>Bridge</color> then.",
  "str_quest_chat_12801999": "Vivian is looking for you urgently. Go to the Bridge now!",
  "str_quest_chat_12802001": "Vice told me that your life has been chaotic recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802002": "Yea... A lot has been going on recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_12802003": "Oh, do you need my help?",
  "str_quest_chat_12802004": "That would be great! Are you coming to the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_12802005": "Oh, I'm not.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802006": "Right...",
  "str_quest_chat_12802007": "Don't look so disappointed!",
  "str_quest_chat_12802008": "Oh, I think I should be able to persist...",
  "str_quest_chat_12802009": "This won't do!",
  "str_quest_chat_12802010": "Oh? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_12802011": "Everything will start falling out of place if you don't keep track of things once you start to get busy! You won't be able to carry on if this goes on for a long time.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802012": "How do you plan to help me then...",
  "str_quest_chat_12802013": "I've gone through your work recently and made you a work schedule.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802014": "You'll see all the tasks you need to do and my suggestions for them.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802015": "I... I can't take this.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802016": "Don't worry about it. I'm used to doing this when I was at Gannon City. It's a piece of cake.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802017": "It only takes me a few minutes.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802018": "Then... I'll take it.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802019": "Thank you so much, Vivian.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802020": "Good luck! Feel free to ask me anything whenever.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802021": "Can I really?",
  "str_quest_chat_12802022": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_12802023": "It's one of my wishes to see you finish all your work properly.",
  "str_quest_chat_12841001": "So this is the Colossus' Organizational Management System?",
  "str_quest_chat_12841002": "Hello, this is Vivian. Do you copy, over?",
  "str_quest_chat_12841003": "Hello, this is PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12841004": "By the way, this is not an Organizational Management System... It's just an ordinary comms terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat_12841005": "\"Organizational Management System\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_12841006": "Hmph. As I said, it's just a normal communication device, not an Organizational Management System.",
  "str_quest_chat_12841007": "But aren't they the same thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_12841008": "A Colossus this big must need an equally-large crew to operate it, so tell me: what is your organization management strategy?",
  "str_quest_chat_12841009": "My strategy...? Well... Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat_12841010": "Yeah, I'm listening.",
  "str_quest_chat_12841011": "I don't have one...",
  "str_quest_chat_12841012": "Everyone lives and works however they want here, so we've never needed one...",
  "str_quest_chat_12841013": "Huh?! That... That just won't do!",
  "str_quest_chat_12841014": "Without a strong management system, how can you expect your plans to succeed without running into countless problems?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12841015": "Countless problems?",
  "str_quest_chat_12841016": "Yes, countless problems! Big ones, small ones, you know...",
  "str_quest_chat_12841017": "I've got it! Why not let me use Illumina's Organizational Management System here?",
  "str_quest_chat_12841018": "I'm an expert on it! I guarantee there will be a detailed, organized plan for every single crewmember here!",
  "str_quest_chat_12841019": "Huh? I don't think we really need it.",
  "str_quest_chat_12851001": "Good morning! According to today's plan, it's time to get up now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12851002": "Good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_12851003": "But there's still five minutes until my alarm goes off...",
  "str_quest_chat_12851004": "Well, I've noticed that you're usually five minutes behind each morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_12851005": "I'm assuming you spend those five minutes in bed, so I came to wake you up early.",
  "str_quest_chat_12851006": "Well, I guess I'll get up now...",
  "str_quest_chat_12852001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12852002": "According to the schedule, it's milk and sandwiches for breakfast today.",
  "str_quest_chat_12852003": "The milk won't get cold if you can be up and ready in 15 minutes.",
  "str_quest_chat_12852004": "I'm up and washing now. I'll be right there!",
  "str_quest_chat_12853001": "Good morning! Are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_12853002": "Hi, Vivian. Need something?",
  "str_quest_chat_12853003": "Shouldn't you be studying in the library right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_12853004": "What're you doing, replying to my messages on your terminal?",
  "str_quest_chat_12853005": "Oh! Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat_12853006": "I-I was just taking a break and replying to everyone's messages!",
  "str_quest_chat_12853007": "At this rate...",
  "str_quest_chat_12853008": "You'll never complete the work program we put together.",
  "str_quest_chat_12853009": "Okay, I'll get right back to work...",
  "str_quest_chat_12853010": "While we're on the subject—",
  "str_quest_chat_12853011": "I'll be sure to add a short break into your program... For replying to messages, and the like.",
  "str_quest_chat_12853012": "S-Sure, thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_12854001": "Are you up yet, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_12854002": "Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_12854003": "What a shame.",
  "str_quest_chat_12854004": "Yes, I am!",
  "str_quest_chat_12854005": "Excellent.",
  "str_quest_chat_12854006": "You have five minutes left to wash your face and brush your teeth.",
  "str_quest_chat_12854007": "You really don't have to go through all this trouble for my sake, Vivian.",
  "str_quest_chat_12854008": "Come now, PlayerName. There's no need to feel shy!",
  "str_quest_chat_12854009": "Making plans is a passion of mine!",
  "str_quest_chat_12854010": "If anything, I should thank you for an opportunity like this!",
  "str_quest_chat_12854011": "S-Sure thing...",
  "str_quest_chat_12861001": "Have you seen Curie?",
  "str_quest_chat_12861002": "Yeah, over here. We're playing and having a good time!",
  "str_quest_chat_12861003": "I'll go pick Curie up now! Sorry for the trouble!",
  "str_quest_chat_12861004": "Curie's very cute.",
  "str_quest_chat_12861005": "The thing is, if you forget to feed it lunch... it might...",
  "str_quest_chat_12861006": "Ouch!",
  "str_quest_chat_12862001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12862002": "Good afternoon, Vivian.",
  "str_quest_chat_12862003": "Do you have plenty of vegetables to eat? A growing boy needs his vegetables!",
  "str_quest_chat_12862004": "Yeah yeah, I'll get some next time...",
  "str_quest_chat_12862005": "Hmm? When did you get so naughty, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_12863001": "Good afternoon. Do you have time right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_12863002": "Good afternoon. Is something the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_12863003": "Yes. Today, there will be a surprise inspection of the lunch being served on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_12863004": "Why don't you come along and check up on the culinary standards on the Colossus with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_12863005": "Okay, I'll be there in a second.",
  "str_quest_chat_12864001": "Sigh...",
  "str_quest_chat_12864002": "Vivian?",
  "str_quest_chat_12864003": "I rarely see you sigh like that... What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_12864004": "I accidentally set the fire too high on the stove and burned today's lunch into a pile of ashes.",
  "str_quest_chat_12864005": "Making it again would require a lot of time. At this rate...",
  "str_quest_chat_12864006": "I won't be able to stick to my plan of making lunch for everyone on the Colossus today.",
  "str_quest_chat_12864007": "This kind of thing happens all the time around here, Vivian. Don't be so hard on yourself!",
  "str_quest_chat_12864008": "I got it!",
  "str_quest_chat_12864009": "I remember seeing some military rations in the warehouse earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_12864010": "Wait... You're not talking about those gross crackers, are you? They taste like cardboard!",
  "str_quest_chat_12864011": "Heheheh... If I serve those, my plan for today will be completed perfectly on time!",
  "str_quest_chat_12864012": "H-Hang on, Vivian! Let's talk about this!",
  "str_quest_chat_12865001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_12865002": "Are there any goals you've wanted to accomplish lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_12865003": "I can design the perfect plan for you to reach or even exceed those goals!",
  "str_quest_chat_12865004": "Really? Well, there's one thing...",
  "str_quest_chat_12865005": "I want to lose weight.",
  "str_quest_chat_12865006": "So you've been thinking about losing weight lately, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_12865007": "Let's see... We can start by reducing your daily food intake by 90%.",
  "str_quest_chat_12865008": "On top of that, we can put you through the same long-term training regimen that all Illumina soldiers must do while on active duty.",
  "str_quest_chat_12865009": "I want to gain weight.",
  "str_quest_chat_12865010": "So you've been thinking about gaining weight lately, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_12865011": "In that case, you'll need to increase your food intake while also reducing your time spent exercising.",
  "str_quest_chat_12865012": "If you need, I can lock you in your room and feed you a pack of high-calorie military crackers every ten minutes?",
  "str_quest_chat_12865013": "Just leave all of the planning to me! I promise you won't regret it!",
  "str_quest_chat_12865014": "Somehow, I'm already starting to regret this entire conversation...",
  "str_quest_chat_12866001": "Good afternoon. Do you happen to have some time right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_12866002": "Good afternoon, Vivian.",
  "str_quest_chat_12866003": "I'm, uh, I'm in the middle of my work plan for the day!",
  "str_quest_chat_12866004": "I see... It looks like you don't need me to remind you anymore, PlayerName. Good for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_12866005": "With that being the case... I have a lot more free time on my hands, but I don't know what to do with it.",
  "str_quest_chat_12866006": "Perhaps it's time for me to design a new work plan.",
  "str_quest_chat_12866007": "Well, if you don't have anything else to do... Why not try taking a break, Vivian?",
  "str_quest_chat_12866008": "Maybe go on a trip or something?",
  "str_quest_chat_12866009": "You're absolutely right, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_12866010": "I don't need a new work plan, I need a new travel plan!",
  "str_quest_chat_12866011": "I-Is that really necessary...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12881001": "Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_12881002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_12881003": "Then I'll send the attendance record to you now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12881004": "What attendance record?",
  "str_quest_chat_12881005": "It's the record of the daily training attendance. You were late five times this month, so you can do five extra push-ups tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_12881006": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12882001": "It's almost time for bed, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_12882002": "In a minute.",
  "str_quest_chat_12882003": "Don't think you can do whatever you want to your body just because you're young. You'll regret it later!",
  "str_quest_chat_12882004": "I-I'll go to bed soon!",
  "str_quest_chat_12883001": "Good evening! Guess why I'm here?",
  "str_quest_chat_12883002": "I have no idea...",
  "str_quest_chat_12883003": "Is there something I haven't finished yet...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12883004": "Hah, your face is the picture of confusion.",
  "str_quest_chat_12883005": "Right... So, what is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_12883006": "Haha! I actually just came to remind you to rest early.",
  "str_quest_chat_12883007": "A youngster like you should make sure he gets enough sleep and go to bed early, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12883008": "...Well, I didn't see that coming.",
  "str_quest_chat_12884001": "PlayerName, it's late.",
  "str_quest_chat_12884002": "Don't stay up late again.",
  "str_quest_chat_12884003": "I won't!",
  "str_quest_chat_12884004": "I've already washed up and I'm headed to bed now",
  "str_quest_chat_12884005": "Seems like you followed the schedule properly this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_12884006": "Well done! This deserves praise.",
  "str_quest_chat_12884007": "Good night, Vivian.",
  "str_quest_chat_12884008": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_12885001": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_12885002": "Good evening, Vivian.",
  "str_quest_chat_12885003": "Ugh, my neck hurts so bad...",
  "str_quest_chat_12885004": "You are getting ready to sleep, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_12885005": "Yes",
  "str_quest_chat_12885006": "I'm in bed already.",
  "str_quest_chat_12885007": "I'm so jealous...",
  "str_quest_chat_12885008": "No",
  "str_quest_chat_12885009": "I'm still outside...",
  "str_quest_chat_12885010": "Oh? Where did you sneak off to?",
  "str_quest_chat_12885011": "Nah, I'm just outside my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_12885012": "Anyway, why is your neck bothering you?",
  "str_quest_chat_12885013": "Probably because I spent too much time at the desk.",
  "str_quest_chat_12885014": "I have to massage my neck every night before I sleep now.",
  "str_quest_chat_12885015": "You be careful about your posture too. Build good habits when you're young.",
  "str_quest_chat_12885016": "Meh, I'm not that young...",
  "str_quest_chat_12885017": "Okay, I shall.",
  "str_quest_chat_12885018": "Good.",
  "str_quest_chat_12885019": "Time for me to turn in. Good night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12885020": "Good night, Vivian.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886001": "PlayerName, are you resting?",
  "str_quest_chat_12886002": "Not yet!",
  "str_quest_chat_12886003": "I still have some work to do!",
  "str_quest_chat_12886004": "I'm about to!",
  "str_quest_chat_12886005": "I'll go to bed after this chapter!",
  "str_quest_chat_12886006": "Yup!",
  "str_quest_chat_12886007": "You seem to have it all planned out.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886008": "What about you, Vivian? Are you ready for bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_12886009": "Unfortunately, I still have to draft the summary report. I might have to pull an all-nighter.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886010": "Oh no, that's tough!",
  "str_quest_chat_12886011": "I don't have a choice. If I don't finish it, the plan can't move forward.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886012": "There can't be a new plan without a summary. Without new plans, a lot of things will spiral out of control.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886013": "Understood.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886014": "Then you should get to it. I hope you'll have time to rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886015": "I hope so, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886016": "I just wanted to check in on you.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886017": "Right, I'm off to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886018": "Good luck, Commander.",
  "str_quest_chat_12886019": "Night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12901001": "I heard that you need my help!",
  "str_quest_chat_12901002": "I'm working on some data issues...",
  "str_quest_chat_12901003": "I think Noah understands this type of thing better than I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_12901004": "Just leave it to me! I know everything!",
  "str_quest_chat_12901005": "Rather than saying that I need your help, it's more like I can't survive without your help.",
  "str_quest_chat_12901006": "So, this is something that only I can help you with!",
  "str_quest_chat_12901007": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_12901008": "Well, I don't think I can explain it in a message...",
  "str_quest_chat_12901009": "I understand!",
  "str_quest_chat_12901010": "Then let's meet in the <color=#FFB400>rec room</color>!",
  "str_quest_chat_12901999": "Noah should already be in the rec room. Don't keep her waiting for too long and go look for her now!",
  "str_quest_chat_12902001": "Knock knock! Let me knock your door and listen to your voice.",
  "str_quest_chat_12902002": "Do you want to build a snowman?",
  "str_quest_chat_12902003": "Are you there? If you are, you should say it out loud. You can give a shout or just move a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat_12902004": "I'm already moving. Wait, I thought you can't see?",
  "str_quest_chat_12902005": "I can sense it! You sound energetic!",
  "str_quest_chat_12902006": "I'll shout then: Arghhhhhh! Is that okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_12902007": "Haha! You're so interesting!",
  "str_quest_chat_12902008": "So, why are you here?",
  "str_quest_chat_12902009": "Do you want to build another snowman?",
  "str_quest_chat_12902010": "Okay, let's build a snowman together.",
  "str_quest_chat_12902011": "But I was worried you couldn't come out again.",
  "str_quest_chat_12902012": "What do you mean by again?",
  "str_quest_chat_12902013": "It's because I've already built a lot of snowmen outside your door.",
  "str_quest_chat_12902014": "What exactly happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_12902015": "I've prepared a gift for you! There are all sorts of large and small snowmen, and sweet snowflakes as well!",
  "str_quest_chat_12902016": "But there are so many snowmen outside your door that I can barely knock on your door.",
  "str_quest_chat_12902017": "Doesn't that mean... My door is blocked?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12902018": "Yes! Ehe!",
  "str_quest_chat_12941001": "Yo, Navigator! Nice to meet ya!",
  "str_quest_chat_12941002": "Gah!... Oh, it's you, Noah! You scared me just now...",
  "str_quest_chat_12941003": "Hee-hee! I hear you're pretty incredible, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_12941004": "I've also heard your Colossus is just like my Ice Sword!",
  "str_quest_chat_12941005": "Ice Sword...? Your weapon?",
  "str_quest_chat_12941006": "That... Doesn't really make sense.",
  "str_quest_chat_12941007": "Sure it does! I fly around on my Ice Sword, just like you! \"Shoom!\"",
  "str_quest_chat_12941008": "So the only similarity is that they both fly?",
  "str_quest_chat_12941009": "Yep! Just like that, I can \"shoom\" straight into the sky!",
  "str_quest_chat_12941010": "W-Wait! What the heck is \"shoom\"...?",
  "str_quest_chat_12941011": "It's the sound I make when I fly! Watch!",
  "str_quest_chat_12941012": "Come again?",
  "str_quest_chat_12941013": "Hang on! You're not going to fly around the Colossus, are you?!",
  "str_quest_chat_12941014": "I don't know what an Ice Sword is, but it might be dangerous for the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_12941015": "So please, come back down!",
  "str_quest_chat_12951001": "Hey Navigator, you awake yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_12951002": "I'm on my way to get some breakfast. Want to join me?",
  "str_quest_chat_12951003": "Yeah! I was just gonna ask you the same!",
  "str_quest_chat_12952001": "Woah! PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_12952002": "Waking up in an Ice Crystal Cluster is exhilarating!",
  "str_quest_chat_12952003": "Noah, you slept in ice crystals last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_12952004": "That's right!",
  "str_quest_chat_12952005": "Isn't it cold?",
  "str_quest_chat_12952006": "Not at all. It's more comfortable than sleeping in my bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_12952007": "You should try it next time, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_12952008": "Uh, I think I'll pass, haha.",
  "str_quest_chat_12953001": "I put my milk in ice crystals, so I can drink it freezing cold.",
  "str_quest_chat_12953002": "It's very delicious that way!",
  "str_quest_chat_12953003": "You really like iced stuff, Noah.",
  "str_quest_chat_12953004": "Absolutely!",
  "str_quest_chat_12953005": "What I love most about Northland is how there's snow everywhere!",
  "str_quest_chat_12961001": "It sure is cold today!",
  "str_quest_chat_12961002": "Huh? I thought you can't feel the temperature?",
  "str_quest_chat_12961003": "Someone taught me this! They said that if I start a conversation by talking about the weather, I'll get to know the other person really quickly!",
  "str_quest_chat_12961004": "That makes sense... But it's very hot today...",
  "str_quest_chat_12962001": "Good afternoon! Wanna go on an adventure with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_12962002": "Good afternoon, Noah. What kind of adventure did you have in mind?",
  "str_quest_chat_12962003": "Noah wants to build a huge ice slide inside the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_12962004": "Then, uh... we can slide down it!",
  "str_quest_chat_12962005": "When I build my slide, can we play together?",
  "str_quest_chat_12962006": "Sure! As long as you don't wreck the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_12963001": "A few rounds of Ice Sword in a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_12963002": "Ice Sword?",
  "str_quest_chat_12963003": "What's Ice Sword?",
  "str_quest_chat_12963004": "Oh... So you don't know about Ice Sword.",
  "str_quest_chat_12963005": "It's a game where we fight with swords made of ice.",
  "str_quest_chat_12963006": "But... it takes time for water to freeze, doesn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_12963007": "That's where my powers come in!",
  "str_quest_chat_12963008": "But you'll want a set of armor first. Ice Swords are sharp.",
  "str_quest_chat_12963009": "I think I'll give it a pass.",
  "str_quest_chat_13001001": "Are you there? Have you returned?",
  "str_quest_chat_13001002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13001003": "Did you just get back?",
  "str_quest_chat_13001004": "Yes, I just got back from outside.",
  "str_quest_chat_13001005": "You've been working so hard!",
  "str_quest_chat_13001006": "I've been back for a while now.",
  "str_quest_chat_13001007": "Y-you actually got back a while ago? I miscalculated!",
  "str_quest_chat_13001008": "Did you return to your room then?",
  "str_quest_chat_13001009": "Not yet. Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_13001010": "That's great! There actually is something I want to ask you about. Can you come to the <color=#FFB400>Cafe</color> right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_13001011": "Please come now!",
  "str_quest_chat_13001031": "Pardon me, but are you sure you don't need my help?",
  "str_quest_chat_13001032": "It's fine! There's no telling what will happen if you help, so really... It's fine!",
  "str_quest_chat_13001033": "I just need to replace a floor panel, fix that wall, and replace the bed and dresser. It's not a big deal.",
  "str_quest_chat_13001034": "Also, I don't know where it came from, but there's a mess in my room that needs cleaning, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_13001035": "Say... Did you happen to see my desk when you went to my room last time?",
  "str_quest_chat_13001036": "Actually, I used to help the mayor organize his desk from time to time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13001037": "W... What does that have to do with anything?",
  "str_quest_chat_13001038": "I even helped him switch out his desk for a new one!",
  "str_quest_chat_13001039": "Wait, what was wrong with the mayor's old desk...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13001040": "It broke.",
  "str_quest_chat_13001041": "Then... Does that mean...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13001042": "I don't think I did a very good job of helping, so I wanted to practice some more!",
  "str_quest_chat_13001043": "You also said we should work hard to make up for our mistakes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13001044": "I see... That \"mess\" in my room is what was left of my old desk...",
  "str_quest_chat_13001045": "That's right! I've taken the liberty of ordering you a new one, too. I'll go get it!",
  "str_quest_chat_13001046": "But... You... Ah, forget it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13001999": "Nadine looks really anxious. You better go to the Cafe quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002001": "Are you there? Did you see my messages?",
  "str_quest_chat_13002002": "I'm here.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002003": "That's great! You're there.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002004": "I'll report directly to you then!",
  "str_quest_chat_13002005": "I'm not here.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002006": "But I saw you come back. According to the intel, you should have seen my messages already.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002007": "Shouldn't the focus be on my reply that I wasn't there...",
  "str_quest_chat_13002008": "Oh, that's right. You must have seen the previous messages if you replied me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002009": "So, what's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_13002010": "There are some repairs I need to report to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002011": "Huh? Did you???",
  "str_quest_chat_13002012": "No, no, someone did blast a hole with a missile at the first location.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002013": "But I'm sure you know that I don't use missiles!",
  "str_quest_chat_13002014": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_13002015": "Someone blasted a hole with a bomb at the second location.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002016": "But I'm sure you know that I don't use bombs!",
  "str_quest_chat_13002017": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_13002018": "Everything is fine though. I stopped them for you, so the damage isn't that serious!",
  "str_quest_chat_13002019": "Thank you! You're the best.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002020": "The floor is cracked at the third location.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002021": "Hmm...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13002022": "I made a mistake when I tried to stop them. I'm sorry... The damage is a little serious.",
  "str_quest_chat_13002023": "I'm going to cry, seriously! I feel so bad for my poor Soroz...",
  "str_quest_chat_13051001": "Good morning, Navigator! I have something to report to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13051002": "Huh? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13051003": "Last night, absolutely nothing of importance happened at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_13051004": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_13051005": "You didn't sleep at all last night, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat_13051006": "Sleeping at night isn't exactly how you make it as a Nightwatcher, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_13051007": "Now then, with my report all done, I should go do a bit more work.",
  "str_quest_chat_13051008": "Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for your help...",
  "str_quest_chat_13051009": "But you should really take better care of yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_13052001": "Good night, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_13052002": "Last night was very quiet, and nothing happened. I'm... going to go rest...",
  "str_quest_chat_13052003": "Wait, it's morning now!",
  "str_quest_chat_13052004": "Did you stay up all night again last night?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13052005": "Relax. I'm used to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13052006": "I'll be fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_13052007": "After all, my job is to stand guard at night and use this lamp to dispel the darkness and bring light those deep in slumber.",
  "str_quest_chat_13052008": "You work so hard...",
  "str_quest_chat_13052009": "All right, Nadine. Sweet dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_13052010": "Hmm, thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13053001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_13053002": "Morning, Nadine.",
  "str_quest_chat_13053003": "I have some good news for you...",
  "str_quest_chat_13053004": "Last night was yet another quiet and peaceful night!",
  "str_quest_chat_13053005": "Were you watching over everyone again last night, Nadine? Thanks for all your hard work!",
  "str_quest_chat_13053006": "Is there anything else you need, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_13053007": "Not at the moment, no. Besides—",
  "str_quest_chat_13053008": "You were up all night on guard duty. Why don't you go get some rest, instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_13053009": "Sigh... You're a model leader, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_13053010": "For someone like you to care so much about an insignificant person like me...",
  "str_quest_chat_13053011": "I promise I'll work even harder to repay you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13054001": "Good morning, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_13054002": "Getting ready for work?",
  "str_quest_chat_13054003": "That's right. You were up all night watching over us again, right Nadine?",
  "str_quest_chat_13054004": "Go get some sleep, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_13054005": "But everyone's working right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_13054006": "How can I afford to slack off when everyone's keeping busy?",
  "str_quest_chat_13054007": "If I slack off, I won't be up for evaluation, and if I'm not up for evaluation, I can forget all about receiving a bonus...",
  "str_quest_chat_13054008": "Oh, that reminds me! When are you going to give me my salary?",
  "str_quest_chat_13054009": "S-Salary?",
  "str_quest_chat_13054010": "Oh no... Could it be that I've been protecting the Colossus every night for free?",
  "str_quest_chat_13054011": "*Coughs* I'll think about it, I promise!",
  "str_quest_chat_13061001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13061002": "Good afternoon... Nadine?",
  "str_quest_chat_13061003": "You're rarely around at this time!",
  "str_quest_chat_13061004": "I'm usually resting at this hour.",
  "str_quest_chat_13061005": "True, you do have to pull all-nighters for your job, after all...",
  "str_quest_chat_13061006": "How come you're up today?",
  "str_quest_chat_13061007": "I requested a day off.",
  "str_quest_chat_13061008": "Then you should seize the chance and rest up!",
  "str_quest_chat_13062001": "Pardon me, but are you busy right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_13062002": "Good afternoon, Nadine. You need something?",
  "str_quest_chat_13062003": "Nothing important, really.",
  "str_quest_chat_13062004": "I just wanted to ask for your advice on how to get stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_13062005": "Er... Don't you think you're asking the wrong person?",
  "str_quest_chat_13062006": "Not at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_13062007": "I studied day and night, fought for my life in training, and shed more blood, sweat, and tears than I can remember... All for a chance to become a Nightwatch.",
  "str_quest_chat_13062008": "But you basically became famous overnight! You were even the City Lord's guest of honor!",
  "str_quest_chat_13062009": "How are you so good at getting everyone to notice you? What's your secret?",
  "str_quest_chat_13062010": "Maybe it has to do with spending 17 years living underground?",
  "str_quest_chat_13062011": "Ah... That explains everything! I'll write that down in my notes!",
  "str_quest_chat_13062012": "I'll go try that right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_13062013": "Wh-What?! It's dangerous! Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_13081001": "Are you awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_13081002": "I'm awake... Wait, no! I'm about to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_13081003": "Oh right, I forgot about that.",
  "str_quest_chat_13081004": "Hmm, what is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13081005": "I want to have breakfast with you, and remembered that you usually sleep around this time. Shall I see you at 4:00 then?",
  "str_quest_chat_13081006": "I haven't agreed to that yet!",
  "str_quest_chat_13082001": "I can't shake the feeling that the stunt in my development is related to my habit of sleeping so late...",
  "str_quest_chat_13082002": "Why don't you sleep more during the day then?",
  "str_quest_chat_13082003": "I need to work during the day...",
  "str_quest_chat_13082004": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_13082005": "You should accompany me then!",
  "str_quest_chat_13082006": "Huh???",
  "str_quest_chat_13083001": "Hello? Are you getting ready for bed now?",
  "str_quest_chat_13083002": "I was just about to call it a night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13083003": "Oh! Sorry for disturbing your sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_13083004": "It's just that... I have a question to ask you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13083005": "I'm still up, actually.",
  "str_quest_chat_13083006": "Perfect!",
  "str_quest_chat_13083007": "I wanted to ask if you were interested in being part of the Nightwatch.",
  "str_quest_chat_13083008": "R-Right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_13083009": "Yep, that's right!",
  "str_quest_chat_13083010": "But please don't misunderstand!",
  "str_quest_chat_13083011": "I'm not asking you this because guard duty feels a bit lonely tonight or anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_13083012": "Oh no! I bet you think I'm not cut out for this job anymore!",
  "str_quest_chat_13083013": "Sorry... Forget I said anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_13083014": "And don't worry! I'll always do my best to protect you while you sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_13083015": "Th-Thanks, Nadine...",
  "str_quest_chat_13084001": "I hear you have trouble sleeping sometimes, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_13084002": "So you've heard about it too, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_13084003": "Is it because you don't feel safe enough during the night...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13084004": "Could it be that you're dissatisfied with my work??",
  "str_quest_chat_13084005": "N-Not at all, Nadine! My sleep troubles have nothing to do with you, I promise!",
  "str_quest_chat_13084006": "But still, I have the duty to help you overcome your sleep problems, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_13084007": "From this day forward, I'll turn off every light aboard the Colossus during my patrols!",
  "str_quest_chat_13084008": "And carry a nice, scented candle along...",
  "str_quest_chat_13084009": "And sing you a lullaby every single night until you fall asleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_13084010": "I'm sure you'll feel better in no time!",
  "str_quest_chat_13084011": "That actually sounds creepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_13084012": "... Oh great, now I'm too scared to go to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_13101001": "Are you sure you're here for me and not Baba Yaga?",
  "str_quest_chat_13101002": "I'm here to see you, Mia.",
  "str_quest_chat_13101003": "Did something happen?",
  "str_quest_chat_13101004": "Did I do anything wrong recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_13101005": "I don't know.",
  "str_quest_chat_13101006": "Baba Yaga seems a little strange recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_13101007": "Really...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13101008": "Could I have been mistaken?",
  "str_quest_chat_13101009": "Anyway... can we talk about it in person?",
  "str_quest_chat_13101010": "Okay, I'm at the <color=#FFB400>Cafe</color>.",
  "str_quest_chat_13101011": "I'll be right there!",
  "str_quest_chat_13101999": "Although you know it's wrong to think that, you still want to get confirmation. Go meet Mia!",
  "str_quest_chat_13102001": "There's something I want to tell you, PlayerName. Please don't be surprised!",
  "str_quest_chat_13102002": "Mia? There's something different about you today.",
  "str_quest_chat_13102003": "Anything that you're happy about?",
  "str_quest_chat_13102004": "Yes, my girlfriend told me she's liking you more and more!",
  "str_quest_chat_13102005": "Your girlfriend? Could it be—",
  "str_quest_chat_13102006": "Yea, it's her!",
  "str_quest_chat_13102007": "She said that we can play games that are of even more fun if we get the chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_13102008": "Is that all right?",
  "str_quest_chat_13102009": "Well, did she say what type of game?",
  "str_quest_chat_13102010": "Hide and seek!",
  "str_quest_chat_13102011": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_13102012": "We'll come to see you at the Colossus when we get the chance!",
  "str_quest_chat_13102013": "Alright.",
  "str_quest_chat_13102014": "Tee-hee, PlayerName, there's no need to be shy.",
  "str_quest_chat_13102015": "Let's have a good time together!",
  "str_quest_chat_13102016": "I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13141001": "Um, good day...",
  "str_quest_chat_13141002": "I have something that I would like to discuss with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13141003": "If you happen to see a shadow moving through the halls at night...",
  "str_quest_chat_13141004": "Please don't be alarmed...",
  "str_quest_chat_13141005": "What? Weird figure at night...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13141006": "Wait a minute, that sounds like some serious haunting. It has never happened before.",
  "str_quest_chat_13141007": "Perhaps there weren't any before, but after I arrived...",
  "str_quest_chat_13141008": "Or rather, once Baba Yaga and I arrived, I believe this place became haunted...",
  "str_quest_chat_13141009": "You and... Baba Yaga? What do you mean...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13141010": "Baba Yaga and I... Share the same body.",
  "str_quest_chat_13141011": "Though she is a bit different than I am. She enjoys making mischief... Especially scaring people.",
  "str_quest_chat_13141012": "So if you run into her in the halls at night, please don't be afraid. She means no harm.",
  "str_quest_chat_13141013": "O-Okay... I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_13142001": "Do you have some time, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_13142002": "If not, it's fine. Whenever you do... I'll... Find... You...",
  "str_quest_chat_13142003": "M-Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat_13142004": "Nice try, but no. When the clock strikes twelve, it's my turn to play!",
  "str_quest_chat_13142005": "Then you must be Baba Yaga.",
  "str_quest_chat_13142006": "\"Baba Yaga\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_13142007": "Hmph, you got me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13142008": "Good, now I won't have to hide my next order of business...",
  "str_quest_chat_13142009": "I've been thinking about the best way... To make your soul happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_13142010": "Now that I'm stronger, I think I have an idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_13142011": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_13142012": "Well? Care to find out?",
  "str_quest_chat_13142013": "To be honest? Not at all...",
  "str_quest_chat_13142014": "What? This is not up to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13142015": "Just wait, you're in for a big surprise...",
  "str_quest_chat_13142016": "In the dark of night, in your deepest dreams...",
  "str_quest_chat_13142017": "Really, I'd rather not...",
  "str_quest_chat_13142018": "H-Huh? Baba Yaga... Where'd you go?",
  "str_quest_chat_13142019": "At night, in my dreams... What the heck is she plotting?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13151001": "Guess who!",
  "str_quest_chat_13151002": "You're Baba Yaga. That wasn't hard at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_13151003": "Are you sure?",
  "str_quest_chat_13151004": "I don't think Mia would joke around like this...",
  "str_quest_chat_13151005": "Um... Sorry, it's me. Baba Yaga told me to try doing this... Sorry for disturbing you...",
  "str_quest_chat_13151006": "Sorry!!",
  "str_quest_chat_13152001": "G... go... good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_13152002": "This way of speaking... Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat_13152003": "Yes... Navigator, I'm thinking of having a cup of black tea.",
  "str_quest_chat_13152004": "Good morning, Mia. I was preparing to have a cup of coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat_13152005": "But now that you mention it, black tea sounds good, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_13152006": "Was I helpful, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_13152007": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_13152008": "That's... um... good. Have a great day!",
  "str_quest_chat_13152009": "You too, Mia.",
  "str_quest_chat_13153001": "I got something to say to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13153002": "Baba Yaga?",
  "str_quest_chat_13153003": "Ha!",
  "str_quest_chat_13153004": "You guessed who I am without missing a beat. Impressive!",
  "str_quest_chat_13153005": "I guess... So what do you need?",
  "str_quest_chat_13153006": "The night's almost over. Mia should be waking up soon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13153007": "I need you to guarantee Mia's safety when I'm not around.",
  "str_quest_chat_13153008": "So tell me, are you up to the job? And just so you know...",
  "str_quest_chat_13153009": "If you tell me no, I'll give you a real mechanical claw experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_13153010": "Y-Yes...!",
  "str_quest_chat_13161001": "Noon is my least favorite time of the day!",
  "str_quest_chat_13161002": "She made me come here... Do you know what I'm talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat_13161003": "Oh... I really do hate this time so...",
  "str_quest_chat_13161004": "Good afternoon... You're...",
  "str_quest_chat_13161005": "Baba Yaga, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_13161006": "Hah, you guessed it—",
  "str_quest_chat_13161007": "Is that Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat_13161008": "You are missing my sister?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13161009": "It's Baba Yaga... Is something wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_13161010": "Mia wanted me to come here and ask you something, our esteemed Caelestite—",
  "str_quest_chat_13161011": "Have you eaten your lunch yet, like a good little Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_13161012": "Heavens— A big boy like you still needs someone to tell him when to eat lunch!?",
  "str_quest_chat_13161013": "Uh... Please tell Mia that I've eaten.",
  "str_quest_chat_13161014": "Excuse me... Baba Yaga?",
  "str_quest_chat_13161015": "Well... Almost.",
  "str_quest_chat_13162001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_13162002": "Oh, hey, Mia... or is it Baba Yaga?",
  "str_quest_chat_13162003": "It's Mia...",
  "str_quest_chat_13162004": "It's rare to see you at noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13162005": "Probably because... I need to hide from her.",
  "str_quest_chat_13162006": "Her?",
  "str_quest_chat_13162007": "Baba Yaga. She'd kept an eye on me if she didn't come out at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13162008": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_13163001": "Uh... Are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_13163002": "Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat_13163003": "Y-You know that it's me...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13163004": "Of course I do!",
  "str_quest_chat_13163005": "Oh... I didn't think you knew me that well, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_13163006": "I was just guessing.",
  "str_quest_chat_13163007": "I knew it... But still, you guessed right, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13163008": "Is something the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_13163009": "I-I accidentally knocked over my lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat_13163010": "It's all my fault for being so clumsy! I'm so sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat_13163011": "So you haven't had lunch yet, right Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat_13163012": "Huh? Y-Yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat_13163013": "Give me just a second. I'll have the Fireflies bring you a new lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_13163014": "PlayerName... You're not going to punish me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13163015": "Why would I want to punish you, Mia?",
  "str_quest_chat_13163016": "Because I wasted all that food by knocking over my lunch... Like a clumsy, inconsiderate child...",
  "str_quest_chat_13163017": "It was an accident, Mia. I could never blame you for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13163018": "Don't worry too much about it. Just enjoy your lunch, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_13163019": "... Th-Thank you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13163020": "I'll make sure Baba Yaga thanks you, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_13163021": "Th-That won't be necessary!",
  "str_quest_chat_13181001": "Good, good, good evening....",
  "str_quest_chat_13181002": "Is that... Mia? Right?",
  "str_quest_chat_13181003": "Right... It's me...",
  "str_quest_chat_13181004": "It's late. Why aren't you sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_13181005": "Oh... You recognized me...",
  "str_quest_chat_13181006": "I drank a little more tea than usual, today...",
  "str_quest_chat_13181007": "I had eight cups altogether... and now I can't sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_13181008": "Well... How about I tell you a story?",
  "str_quest_chat_13181009": "R-Really? That'd be...",
  "str_quest_chat_13181010": "That'd be fantastic...",
  "str_quest_chat_13182001": "Thirty-five, thirty-five! Hee!",
  "str_quest_chat_13182002": "That sounds like Baba Yaga.",
  "str_quest_chat_13182003": "Ah, getting better, aren't you, the princess's knight?",
  "str_quest_chat_13182004": "Were you counting? Thirty-five what?",
  "str_quest_chat_13182005": "The poor Umbraton souls I freaked out tonight... Thirty-five of them!",
  "str_quest_chat_13182006": "I pray for them...",
  "str_quest_chat_13182007": "You pray for them? They lost their minds just looking at me!",
  "str_quest_chat_13182008": "Why don't you pray for me whom they called a monster, knight?",
  "str_quest_chat_13182009": "So-sorry, Baba Yaga!",
  "str_quest_chat_13182010": "Well, certain apologies always come late!",
  "str_quest_chat_13182011": "But I'll let you off the hook this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13182012": "Go to sleep, go to sleep, adorable Caelestite...",
  "str_quest_chat_13182013": "Good night, Baba Yaga.",
  "str_quest_chat_13183001": "It's way past bedtime for the princess's knight...",
  "str_quest_chat_13183002": "Hee hee... You know, children who stay up late get nightmares!",
  "str_quest_chat_13183003": "Baba Yaga, it's you, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_13183004": "I'll get to sleep right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_13183005": "Hee, you do that...",
  "str_quest_chat_13184001": "What're you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_13184002": "Uh... Getting ready for bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_13184003": "Sleep is boring! Come shopping with me!",
  "str_quest_chat_13184004": "I'd love to, Baba Yaga, but I'm actually really tired today.",
  "str_quest_chat_13184005": "Hah? I don't remember telling you who I am!",
  "str_quest_chat_13184006": "How can you be so sure I'm Baba Yaga?",
  "str_quest_chat_13184007": "Because Mia wouldn't want to go out shopping this late...",
  "str_quest_chat_13184008": "Wow, you really do know us well!",
  "str_quest_chat_13184009": "That only makes me want to go shopping with you even more!",
  "str_quest_chat_13184010": "B-But—",
  "str_quest_chat_13184011": "Oh, you don't have to say yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13184012": "We'll just take a stroll near your room tonight!",
  "str_quest_chat_13184013": "No, please!!",
  "str_quest_chat_13185001": "Um... Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_13185002": "I-It's Mia.",
  "str_quest_chat_13185003": "I just wanted to ask... What's the lights-out time here on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_13185004": "\"Lights-out\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_13185005": "Y-You know... The time when everyone has to turn off their lights and go to bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_13185006": "I-I'm worried that... I won't be ready for bed when it's time for lights-out, and I'll get in trouble.",
  "str_quest_chat_13185007": "Don't worry about that, Mia.",
  "str_quest_chat_13185008": "We don't have any strict rules like that on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13185009": "D-Does that mean... I can go to bed whenever I want?",
  "str_quest_chat_13185010": "That's right!",
  "str_quest_chat_13185011": "Then that means... I-I can make myself another pot of tea!",
  "str_quest_chat_13185012": "Except... I should still try to go to bed at a reasonable time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13185013": "Goodnight, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13185014": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13186001": "Things are getting pretty stale here on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_13186002": "Hey! When are you gonna bring some new people on board?",
  "str_quest_chat_13186003": "Does that mean... you wanna make some new friends, Baba Yaga?",
  "str_quest_chat_13186004": "That's a nice way to put it, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_13186005": "I could use a few new friends...",
  "str_quest_chat_13186006": "Friends that I could scare the snot out of in the middle of the night, that is!",
  "str_quest_chat_13186007": "It's been so long since I've seen a real look of terror on someone's face here. It's sooo boring!",
  "str_quest_chat_13186008": "B-But aren't you afraid that you'll scare off your new friends?",
  "str_quest_chat_13186009": "That's the plan! Hahahaha!",
  "str_quest_chat_13201001": "You can relax because I'm currently protecting this ancient Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13201002": "Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13201003": "Such picturesque scenery and a wonderful panoramic view. I think I'll gradually fall in love with this place.",
  "str_quest_chat_13201004": "Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13201005": "Navigator, there's something I need your help with. Please come to the <color=#FFB400>Bridge</color>.",
  "str_quest_chat_13201999": "Charon seems to be looking for you for something. Meet him at the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_13202001": "My dear PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_13202002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_13202003": "Do you ever feel sad? Do you feel lonely at night? Loneliness in the dark?",
  "str_quest_chat_13202004": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_13202005": "Really? Don't let the false prosperity of the Colossus fool you. Tell me the truth!",
  "str_quest_chat_13202006": "Charon, what are you doing...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13202007": "I customized an album called 'Silent Cry' for you using the latest Gothic metal style",
  "str_quest_chat_13202008": "Um, Charon, I don't need these...",
  "str_quest_chat_13202009": "There's no need to be polite with me. This is something a friend should do.",
  "str_quest_chat_13202010": "I'll get Dove to deliver it to you. Remember to tell me what you think after you get it!",
  "str_quest_chat_13202011": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_13241001": "Hello, captain of the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_13241002": "Wow, just look at the size of this thing! I'm glad you and I have the same passion for them!",
  "str_quest_chat_13241003": "Thanks for the compliment.",
  "str_quest_chat_13241004": "I mean that, too! It reminds me of my partner: Other End!",
  "str_quest_chat_13241005": "Both of them send my heart racing like a mustang! I'm sure your Colossus is just as reliable, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_13241006": "\"The same passion\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_13241007": "You didn't get it? I mean that you have an enormous buddy, just like me!",
  "str_quest_chat_13241008": "Your Soroz, and my Other End... They're both partners that we could never be without!",
  "str_quest_chat_13241009": "I see... You're absolutely right. Soroz raised me from a little kid and has been my only friend for the last 17 years...",
  "str_quest_chat_13241010": "Your only friend, eh? That's perfect!",
  "str_quest_chat_13241011": "Then... Do you happen to like metal, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_13241012": "Metal music? I don't think I've ever heard it before...",
  "str_quest_chat_13241013": "No way!! You've gotta listen to some right away!!",
  "str_quest_chat_13241014": "Since we have so much in common, I'm sure you'll be obsessed with it once you hear it, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_13241015": "N-Next time, sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_13251001": "When a new dawn breaks, it's time to rise and shine, my friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_13251002": "Morning... Charon...",
  "str_quest_chat_13251003": "Hey! There you are, buddy!",
  "str_quest_chat_13251004": "Wait, wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_13251005": "Were you calling me, your buddy, just now, or were you talking to the train?",
  "str_quest_chat_13251006": "Why? You, of course—the Master of the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13251007": "Wait a minute... The deep meaning behind your words has suddenly dawned on me...",
  "str_quest_chat_13251008": "Mentioning such a thing clearly indicates that you're dying to see my train again!",
  "str_quest_chat_13251009": "Haha! In that case, just sit down and prepare yourself! You're in for a surprise!",
  "str_quest_chat_13251010": "No... That's not what I meant! No surprises, please...",
  "str_quest_chat_13251011": "Are you honestly refusing me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13251012": "... Yes, that's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_13252001": "Glory, glory, glory! Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_13252002": "Good... Good morning, Charon!",
  "str_quest_chat_13252003": "And now.. The stench of dirty money fills the air...",
  "str_quest_chat_13252004": "Ah! An exquisitely embossed coffee cup! A divine cake made through thirty-eight unique processes! Leather tinged with the smell of blood!",
  "str_quest_chat_13252005": "Now there's my favorite song playing—Elegy of Filth!",
  "str_quest_chat_13252006": "Huh? I feel there's something missing from this morning's performance...",
  "str_quest_chat_13252007": "Ah, yes! My dearest observer! We await your arrival!",
  "str_quest_chat_13252008": "Would you like to come here and spend this wonderful morning with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13252009": "I... Thanks... But I can't...",
  "str_quest_chat_13252010": "Oh... If only you could hear the echoing heartbreaks in my body right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_13253001": "My dearest friend, would you be willing to...",
  "str_quest_chat_13253002": "Sail across the sea of music with me... to the very end of heavenly tune?",
  "str_quest_chat_13253003": "You want to... perform with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13253004": "I'm impressed, the Navigator of Colossus, the Caelestite with acute senses...",
  "str_quest_chat_13253005": "I want to make a band... that performs the opera pieces I've written.",
  "str_quest_chat_13253006": "The great commanding skills of the Navigator must make you a great conductor!",
  "str_quest_chat_13253007": "But I don't know anything about music... or the opera, for that matter.",
  "str_quest_chat_13253008": "What a pity...",
  "str_quest_chat_13253009": "Oh, my dream... vaporized like the morning dew...",
  "str_quest_chat_13254001": "Another marvelous morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_13254002": "Charon? You got up early today...",
  "str_quest_chat_13254003": "Of course, my dear friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_13254004": "If you wish to know why I got up so early, it's because I got something important to do today.",
  "str_quest_chat_13254005": "Did you write a new play?",
  "str_quest_chat_13254006": "Did you compose a new tune?",
  "str_quest_chat_13254007": "Oh, if only...!",
  "str_quest_chat_13254008": "To tell the truth, I'm in a meeting as we speak.",
  "str_quest_chat_13254009": "As I send this message, I can feel Vivian staring daggers at me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13254010": "I'm afraid I must resume the conversation later, my dearest friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_13254011": "...?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13254012": "You should focus on the meeting, Charon!",
  "str_quest_chat_13255001": "The light has pierced the veil of the night to brighten the magnificent stage!",
  "str_quest_chat_13255002": "Morning, my friend, the show shall commence now!",
  "str_quest_chat_13255003": "Morning, Charon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13255004": "So what kind of screenplay do you have in mind this time?",
  "str_quest_chat_13255005": "It's about a great genius and his only true friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_13255006": "The genius always feels lonely, and only his true friend can hear the music raging in his heart!",
  "str_quest_chat_13255007": "Therefore, true friend, would you...",
  "str_quest_chat_13255008": "Uh, if you're talking about grabbing breakfast, I already ate.",
  "str_quest_chat_13255009": "Oh no, is that the sound of a broken heart I hear in my chest?",
  "str_quest_chat_13256001": "Circuits normal, fuel full, personnel in position.",
  "str_quest_chat_13256002": "Train one, off we go!",
  "str_quest_chat_13256003": "Are you working, Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13256004": "Yes, my friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_13256005": "You seem different from usual.",
  "str_quest_chat_13256006": "As you can see, I am currently Charon the Acheron Ferryman!",
  "str_quest_chat_13256007": "The rails are the strings, the schedule is the score, and the train is the performer!",
  "str_quest_chat_13256008": "Come, hear the melody played by the Other End!",
  "str_quest_chat_13256009": "You know what, just kidding. You're still the same Charon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13257001": "Good morning, my dearest friend and supporter!",
  "str_quest_chat_13257002": "Morning, Officer Charon...",
  "str_quest_chat_13257003": "Why? Why are you addressing me like that?",
  "str_quest_chat_13257004": "It feels as though a vast distance has come between us...",
  "str_quest_chat_13257005": "As though you're standing on the shores of a distant land on the other side of the great sea.",
  "str_quest_chat_13257006": "Watching me as I helplessly fill the space betwixt with grains of sand, trying fruitlessly to reach you once more!",
  "str_quest_chat_13257007": "I-I didn't mean it like that! I'm still a little groggy, that's all...",
  "str_quest_chat_13257008": "If the fog of sleep is still befuddling your mind...",
  "str_quest_chat_13257009": "Then allow me to sing you a song that will lift your spirits and set your heart ablaze!",
  "str_quest_chat_13257010": "Er, n-no thanks, Charon! I'm suddenly feeling a lot more awake!",
  "str_quest_chat_13258001": "Sleeping in on a drowsy morning always brings the most bizarre dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_13258002": "Did you dream of something last night, Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13258003": "Indeed I did.",
  "str_quest_chat_13258004": "I dreamt of a world where the sky and sea were one. An endless, illusory world.",
  "str_quest_chat_13258005": "Floating through the infinite universe with Other End, neither rhythm nor melody could reach my ears.",
  "str_quest_chat_13258006": "That sounds... really lonely.",
  "str_quest_chat_13258007": "Ah, just what I expected from you, my dearest friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_13258008": "You knew exactly how I felt in my dream!",
  "str_quest_chat_13258009": "But now, I dare say I'm not alone anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_13258010": "Could a person such as myself, who has grown accustomed to solitude, still hold favor with the gods of art?",
  "str_quest_chat_13258011": "To be alone, or not to be alone. That is the question.",
  "str_quest_chat_13259001": "The morning is just as beautiful on a day full of work as on a day full of rest!",
  "str_quest_chat_13259002": "Uh, Charon? Are you...",
  "str_quest_chat_13259003": "Going on tour?",
  "str_quest_chat_13259004": "Ah, my dearest friend... How kind of you to remember my beautiful passion!",
  "str_quest_chat_13259005": "However, I could never forsake my daytime occupation so callously.",
  "str_quest_chat_13259006": "Doing transportation?",
  "str_quest_chat_13259007": "Ah, my dearest friend, how kind of you to remember my noble profession!",
  "str_quest_chat_13259008": "Now, without further ado. I, Charon, Chief of Transportation for the Illumina Federation, shall begin working beautifully and earnestly!",
  "str_quest_chat_13259009": "He sure has lots of energy today...",
  "str_quest_chat_13259010": "I should do my best, too! It's the start of a new day, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_13260001": "Act 1, Scene 1!",
  "str_quest_chat_13260002": "Hah?",
  "str_quest_chat_13260003": "Dawn is always the first act of the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13260004": "I wonder who shall take the stage first.",
  "str_quest_chat_13260005": "Is it you, Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13260006": "A solo performance, you say?",
  "str_quest_chat_13260007": "Is it me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13260008": "Ah... You suggest we share the stage, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_13260009": "What a splendid idea!",
  "str_quest_chat_13260010": "It's settled, then! Let us begin!",
  "str_quest_chat_13261001": "Did you happen to see the posters I placed throughout the Bridge?",
  "str_quest_chat_13261002": "Oh, those were your doing, Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13261003": "Yes, though they are quite mediocre in quality.",
  "str_quest_chat_13261004": "Feel free to toss them in the trash once you've taken a look.",
  "str_quest_chat_13261005": "You think so? I think they look nice.",
  "str_quest_chat_13261006": "But don't you see how stiff these actors look? They may as well be made of wood!",
  "str_quest_chat_13261007": "You have a point. They all have the same expression on their face, don't they?",
  "str_quest_chat_13261008": "Indeed, and that is because they only have a single photogenic look on their faces.",
  "str_quest_chat_13261009": "For this reason, they only allow themselves to be seen from a particular angle while wearing that expression.",
  "str_quest_chat_13261010": "What about you, Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13261011": "I'm nothing like the amateurs on those posters, my friend. And that is because—",
  "str_quest_chat_13261012": "My most flattering camera angle? All 360 degrees.",
  "str_quest_chat_13262001": "Another beautiful day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13262002": "As well as...",
  "str_quest_chat_13262003": "Look what we have here. A perfect me, and a nearly perfect you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13262004": "Hah?",
  "str_quest_chat_13262005": "Wh-What about me isn't perfect, exactly?",
  "str_quest_chat_13262006": "Ah! There it is!",
  "str_quest_chat_13262007": "By exchanging words with me, you have now become... perfect!",
  "str_quest_chat_13262008": "J-Just like that?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13263001": "Greetings, my dearest friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_13263002": "I have just finished rehearsing for a brand-new play!",
  "str_quest_chat_13263003": "Care to attend my performance and shower me with praise?",
  "str_quest_chat_13263004": "S-Sorry Charon, but I really don't have the time...",
  "str_quest_chat_13263005": "Is that so? How very unfortunate. For you, that is.",
  "str_quest_chat_13263006": "I suppose, you can always ask other dear friends of yours to attend the performance.",
  "str_quest_chat_13263007": "I must say, there aren't many people I call dear friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_13263008": "Why is that...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13263009": "There is such a thing as being too charismatic, perhaps.",
  "str_quest_chat_13263010": "With an overpowering charisma such as mine, it is natural for others to keep their distance.",
  "str_quest_chat_13263011": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_13264001": "Attention, please!",
  "str_quest_chat_13264002": "What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_13264003": "I shall now read from a play that celebrates the joy of friendship!",
  "str_quest_chat_13264004": "Specifically, a single line that has shaken me to my very core...",
  "str_quest_chat_13264005": "A line that I will now share with you, my dearest friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_13264006": "With me, huh? I'm actually kind of excited to hear it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13264007": "Then please lend me your ears!",
  "str_quest_chat_13264008": "I would like, if it were possible, not to have the curtain close on my involvement in your life.",
  "str_quest_chat_13264009": "Eh?",
  "str_quest_chat_13265001": "What's this? The Umbraton tabloids even have a section dedicated to theater reviews?",
  "str_quest_chat_13265002": "Uh, I wouldn't read those if I were you...",
  "str_quest_chat_13265003": "Tell me, my friend: which would you like to hear first? The good news or the bad?",
  "str_quest_chat_13265004": "The good news...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13265005": "The good news is that I care little and less about their opinions of me!",
  "str_quest_chat_13265006": "So you saw them already, huh...",
  "str_quest_chat_13265007": "Indeed. Which, coincidentally, was the bad news I was about to share with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13265008": "The bad news...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13265009": "The bad news is, I have already seen their critiques of my performances.",
  "str_quest_chat_13265010": "You don't look too upset about them, though?",
  "str_quest_chat_13265011": "Indeed. Which, coincidentally, was the good news I was about to share with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13265012": "Fret not, my dearest friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_13265013": "Their reviews could never bother me in the slightest. After all...",
  "str_quest_chat_13265014": "An extraordinary world does not require understanding from those who are mediocre.",
  "str_quest_chat_13281001": "That late night landscape—it always steals my gaze, fixing my eyes to the starry sky...",
  "str_quest_chat_13281002": "Good evening, Charon... Are you...",
  "str_quest_chat_13281003": "The sky above and the ground below—they form such a brilliantly subtle, and wonderful juxtaposition...",
  "str_quest_chat_13281004": "Who can tell the difference between the immortality in the heavens and in hell?",
  "str_quest_chat_13281005": "Who can understand the ultimate goal of both angels and demons is to convert those who are toiling in the mortal realm?",
  "str_quest_chat_13281006": "Who can say... a Colossus and a train...",
  "str_quest_chat_13281007": "Ah, I seem to have reached something of a mental block.",
  "str_quest_chat_13281008": "How about this little creation of mine? Does it possess a profound philosophical meaning?",
  "str_quest_chat_13281009": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_13281010": "Erm... Maybe...",
  "str_quest_chat_13281011": "I didn't really get it...",
  "str_quest_chat_13281012": "Oh, what a shame! It looks like I'll have to devote more time to cultivating you in the literary arts!",
  "str_quest_chat_13282001": "Gah... Gah...",
  "str_quest_chat_13282002": "Woo... Gah... Woo... Gah...",
  "str_quest_chat_13282003": "Good evening, Charon... Are you still...",
  "str_quest_chat_13282004": "Gah... Gah!",
  "str_quest_chat_13282005": "What are you saying...? Is something wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_13282006": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_13282007": "I was singing to you. I heard the lyrics of that song just now...",
  "str_quest_chat_13282008": "How wondrous it is! Truly a song of glorious praise!",
  "str_quest_chat_13282009": "You really... love your music...",
  "str_quest_chat_13282010": "...Since you're fine, I'll just go to bed... Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13282011": "Good night! I hope the meaning of the lyrics sinks in as you sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_13283001": "Now—it's showtime!",
  "str_quest_chat_13283002": "Isn't it bedtime!?",
  "str_quest_chat_13283003": "My dear Navigator, being the owner of such a majestic Colossus, you should open your mind to a little artistic edification before going to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_13283004": "So, which will you choose? Music or drama?",
  "str_quest_chat_13283005": "If I really have to, then... music...",
  "str_quest_chat_13283006": "Oh! A wise choice!",
  "str_quest_chat_13283007": "Wait a moment! I shall share our entire metal music collection with you immediately!",
  "str_quest_chat_13283008": "Oh, that's it... I should broadcast it throughout the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_13283009": "If I really have to, then... drama...",
  "str_quest_chat_13283010": "Excellent! The Acheron Ferryman, King of the Stage, Charon has memorized a total of thirty-six plays to perfection!",
  "str_quest_chat_13283011": "Since you're in such a cultured mood today, I will perform all thirty-six for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13283012": "...Can I change my mind, Mr. Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13283013": "Next time... We can do that next time, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_13283014": "Oh, no... I'm rather sad to see things end this way... I think I'm... going to cry...",
  "str_quest_chat_13284001": "It is late...",
  "str_quest_chat_13284002": "It is late... Aren't you going to sleep, Mr. Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13284003": "Shh...",
  "str_quest_chat_13284004": "Now, please look out of the window... Do you see the brightest star in the sky?",
  "str_quest_chat_13284005": "Yes... I see it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13284006": "Is there something special about it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13284007": "The radiant, dazzling light... shines only for the chosen ones.",
  "str_quest_chat_13284008": "...Hahaha, yes, it shines for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_13284009": "It's really quite embarrassing that you should witness the stars falling for me, my dear Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_13284010": "...You're amazing, Mr. Charon! A true legend!",
  "str_quest_chat_13284011": "I never thought I'd be blessed with such an honor...",
  "str_quest_chat_13284012": "To ask to fall asleep at the same time as an unparalleled genius?",
  "str_quest_chat_13284013": "Hahahahaha! Of course, dear Navigator! Even you admit that I'm a genius?",
  "str_quest_chat_13284014": "Well then, let's go to sleep together!",
  "str_quest_chat_13285001": "The sun! The night! Are blessings of the divine!",
  "str_quest_chat_13285002": "They are just natural phenomena, Charon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13285003": "No! The Navigator of Colossus, have you ever thought about...",
  "str_quest_chat_13285004": "What if the sun no longer arose, and night no longer befell?",
  "str_quest_chat_13285005": "What would the world become?",
  "str_quest_chat_13285006": "I... I don't know.",
  "str_quest_chat_13285007": "Actually... I don't know too. That's why I asked you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13285008": "Please, think about it on your own... Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13286001": "Inspiration peaks in the depth of night!",
  "str_quest_chat_13286002": "So is that when you brainstorm screenplays?",
  "str_quest_chat_13286003": "I'm personally way too sleepy at night to ever do anything...",
  "str_quest_chat_13286004": "It is then that dreams and reality meet, when epic scores and dramas are born.",
  "str_quest_chat_13286005": "I know you understand what I mean by that, my friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_13286006": "Hmm, I'll try to...",
  "str_quest_chat_13286007": "But it's time for me to go to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_13286008": "Good night, Charon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13286009": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_13287001": "Good night, my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_13287002": "Good evening, Charon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13287003": "Might I ask how you plan to end the final act of the day?",
  "str_quest_chat_13287004": "Not sure... Maybe I'll ask the Fireflies to sing me a lullaby?",
  "str_quest_chat_13287005": "... A mundane conclusion, indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_13287006": "How could you possibly settle for something so bland?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13287007": "Wouldn't you prefer to ride with me into the very depths of hell aboard Other End and fight for our very lives?",
  "str_quest_chat_13287008": "That sounds like a bit too much, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_13287009": "Refusing me yet again, I see?",
  "str_quest_chat_13287010": "Ah, but to be refused by PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_13287011": "Is a conclusion most exhilarating, as well!",
  "str_quest_chat_13288001": "I do so love to rewatch my films in the evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_13288002": "\"Work\"? Are you talking about your movies?",
  "str_quest_chat_13288003": "I just knew you would know what I meant!",
  "str_quest_chat_13288004": "The tragedies that take place at night are always the most heartbreaking.",
  "str_quest_chat_13288005": "Tell me, my friend, do you enjoy watching tragedies?",
  "str_quest_chat_13288006": "I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_13288007": "Oh, my dearest friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_13288008": "Our bond is stronger than even that of twin brothers!",
  "str_quest_chat_13288009": "I shall do my best to perform in more tragedies in the future, just for your viewing pleasure!",
  "str_quest_chat_13288010": "Not too much.",
  "str_quest_chat_13288011": "Oh, my dearest friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_13288012": "This is my first time hearing that you are not fond of tragedies.",
  "str_quest_chat_13288013": "Does this mean I must perform in more comedies from now on...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13289001": "Why does inspiration elude me so...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13289002": "So you get blocks sometimes too, Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13289003": "The creation of artistic masterpieces is no easy feat, my dear friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_13289004": "Many a night doth pass without the twinkling of the stars overhead...",
  "str_quest_chat_13289005": "Sounds like a tough time...",
  "str_quest_chat_13289006": "But there are lots of stars out tonight, though!",
  "str_quest_chat_13289007": "Ah, how I envy the night sky tonight... Would that inspiration shine on me like those countless, dazzling stars above!",
  "str_quest_chat_13289008": "Maybe you should try relaxing a little bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_13289009": "Counting stars always helps me calm down, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_13289010": "Counting stars? Wait... I can feel the warmth of a brilliant, new idea pouring from my mind into my very heart right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_13289011": "Thank you for inspiring me, my dearest friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_13289012": "Er... Don't mention it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13290001": "\"Goodnight, my darling youth.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_13290002": "Good night, Charon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13290003": "Wait a minute... That can't be right!",
  "str_quest_chat_13290004": "Did I actually hear you say \"good night\" just now, Charon?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13290005": "Don't be so surprised, dear PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13290006": "I am simply rehearsing a character's line from a play.",
  "str_quest_chat_13290007": "Yet despite my best efforts, I simply cannot seem to grasp the emotion behind this line.",
  "str_quest_chat_13290008": "I think...",
  "str_quest_chat_13290009": "I think it was fine!",
  "str_quest_chat_13290010": "Splendid! Does this mean I finally succeeded?",
  "str_quest_chat_13290011": "It could've used a little more love.",
  "str_quest_chat_13290012": "I see... Quite the emotionally profound line, indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_13290013": "It appears I require more practice...",
  "str_quest_chat_13291001": "Hey! You shouldn't be the one to say goodnight to me!",
  "str_quest_chat_13291002": "Huh? Are you feeling okay, Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13291003": "With all of my performances lately, I haven't had much time to listen to any heavy metal...",
  "str_quest_chat_13291004": "But tonight, I shall play my most beloved songs!",
  "str_quest_chat_13291005": "That familiar, blood-boiling sensation will consume me once more, like a roaring flame!",
  "str_quest_chat_13291006": "I also intend to write an entirely new song, as well!",
  "str_quest_chat_13291007": "A metal track based on the emotions I just described to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13291008": "Well? What do you think, my dearest friend?",
  "str_quest_chat_13291009": "I think...",
  "str_quest_chat_13291010": "It really suits your style!",
  "str_quest_chat_13291011": "It rocks!",
  "str_quest_chat_13291012": "I just know you'll love it, as well!",
  "str_quest_chat_13291013": "Once I finish writing it, I shall upload it to the Fireflies so that you can listen to it whenever you please!",
  "str_quest_chat_13291014": "Oh, uh... Th-Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301001": "Hello, tourist. I am Blanc. Your ticket is ready.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301002": "... Ticket? I didn't order any tickets.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301003": "You still don't get it? PlayerName, you're really adorable.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301004": "As the guide, I'll introduce to every tourist of Lumopolis everything they're interested in knowing.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301005": "But I don't just introduce Lumopolis to tourists.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301006": "Oh? Ms. Blanc, do you have another part-time job in Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_13301007": "Part-time job? Hmm... it's possible that my job as a guide is actually my part-time job.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301008": "What? Ms. Blanc, could you be another city's...",
  "str_quest_chat_13301009": "Another city? Hmm... I might consider it if they really do need me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301010": "But I am currently serving Lumopolis as its guide wholeheartedly.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301011": "However, I sometimes get sick of showing tourists around Lumopolis too.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301012": "I also want to show special tourists special things.",
  "str_quest_chat_13301013": "Do you understand? PlayerName, if interested, you're more than welcome to take part in my special tour.",
  "str_quest_chat_13361001": "Do you have any plans for the afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_13361002": "Not for now.",
  "str_quest_chat_13361003": "Do you want me to show you around Lumopolis then?",
  "str_quest_chat_13361004": "That'll be the fifth time this month...",
  "str_quest_chat_13361005": "There are still many places I haven't brought you to yet. Five times is far from enough!",
  "str_quest_chat_13362001": "By the way... the Colossus really is huge.",
  "str_quest_chat_13362002": "If I take a walk here, I won't finish seeing everything in just one day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13362003": "Yeah. Sometimes I need the fireflies to guide me too.",
  "str_quest_chat_13362004": "Fireflies... as guide?",
  "str_quest_chat_13362005": "Fireflies usually know their way.",
  "str_quest_chat_13362006": "They need to fly around in the Colossus every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13362007": "They really are natural guides...",
  "str_quest_chat_13362008": "What's the matter, Ms. Blanc?",
  "str_quest_chat_13362009": "Looks like I'll never hold a candle to them...",
  "str_quest_chat_13362010": "... in being a Colossus Guide.",
  "str_quest_chat_13362011": "Ugh... Please don't get competitive on this.",
  "str_quest_chat_13363001": "How was your morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_13363002": "Not bad, Ms. Blanc!",
  "str_quest_chat_13363003": "You?",
  "str_quest_chat_13363004": "Pretty good, as well. Just reading the paper by the road and enjoying a cup of coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat_13363005": "It's wonderful to have a quiet day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13363006": "That sounds terrific.",
  "str_quest_chat_13363007": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13363008": "You should do this when you get a chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_13363009": "Just watching people passing by, enjoying the weather... It's actually very fulfilling.",
  "str_quest_chat_13363010": "Got it, Ms. Blanc.",
  "str_quest_chat_13364001": "Good afternoon. Are you resting right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_13364002": "I haven't taken a break yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_13364003": "Now that you mentioned it, I'm feeling a little tired.",
  "str_quest_chat_13364004": "How can you hope to accomplish anything, working in that state?",
  "str_quest_chat_13364005": "Here, let me make you a cup of coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat_13364006": "I just finished my break!",
  "str_quest_chat_13364007": "Yeah, I took a great nap!",
  "str_quest_chat_13364008": "Wonderful, then it looks like you're ready to jump back into your work.",
  "str_quest_chat_13364009": "But before you do, please let me brew you a cup of tea.",
  "str_quest_chat_13364010": "I'll have the Fireflies bring it to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13364011": "Thank you so much, Ms. Blanc!",
  "str_quest_chat_13364012": "You're very welcome. It's the least I can do for you right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_13365001": "Was today's lunch to your liking?",
  "str_quest_chat_13365002": "W-Why do you ask, Ms. Blanc...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13365003": "Ensuring customer satisfaction is a very important part of a guide's work.",
  "str_quest_chat_13365004": "So you were in charge of lunch today, Ms. Blanc?",
  "str_quest_chat_13365005": "It was delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_13365006": "Of course it was. I hired the best chef in Lumopolis to make it, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_13365007": "You should be receiving his bill in the next few days.",
  "str_quest_chat_13365008": "Huh? B-Bill?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13365009": "There's no need to be so frightened. He's an old friend of mine, so he's giving you a discount.",
  "str_quest_chat_13365010": "I don't have an appetite all of a sudden...",
  "str_quest_chat_13381001": "It's quite late now. Are you still working?",
  "str_quest_chat_13381002": "No, I'm writing my diary.",
  "str_quest_chat_13381003": "There was once a time when I wrote in my diary every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13381004": "What about now?",
  "str_quest_chat_13381005": "I usually fall asleep halfway, so I stopped writing.",
  "str_quest_chat_13381006": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_13382001": "The night breeze is quite chilly.",
  "str_quest_chat_13382002": "Are you still awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_13382003": "Yes. Do you want to have a cup of black tea?",
  "str_quest_chat_13382004": "That would be nice.",
  "str_quest_chat_13382005": "Can you also bring me a coat? It's getting chilly.",
  "str_quest_chat_13382006": "... So this was your purpose all along!",
  "str_quest_chat_13383001": "Good evening. How's your night going?",
  "str_quest_chat_13383002": "I've just returned to my room...",
  "str_quest_chat_13383003": "You went out on a mission today...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13383004": "Right... I'm so tired...",
  "str_quest_chat_13383005": "If you went out on a mission... You must've gone to Umbraton, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_13383006": "I'm sorry to say that I didn't...",
  "str_quest_chat_13383007": "That's a shame. Umbraton is a really interesting place.",
  "str_quest_chat_13383008": "Right... I've been there before.",
  "str_quest_chat_13383009": "Really... Then I can say what's on my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_13383010": "There are some creepy legends about that place...",
  "str_quest_chat_13383011": "Would you like to hear them?",
  "str_quest_chat_13383012": "No, no, no... That's alright...",
  "str_quest_chat_13383013": "Oh... So, you're afraid of horror stories?",
  "str_quest_chat_13383014": "Erm, well... I just...",
  "str_quest_chat_13383015": "...Yeah, I'm really afraid of them!",
  "str_quest_chat_13383016": "I'm surprised at how open you are about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13383017": "In that case, go get some rest. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13383018": "Looks like you let me live, Ms. Blanc...",
  "str_quest_chat_13384001": "Good evening. Do you have a habit of staying up late?",
  "str_quest_chat_13384002": "Good evening, Ms. Blanc.",
  "str_quest_chat_13384003": "I don't stay up on purpose...",
  "str_quest_chat_13384004": "It's just I've still got things to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_13384005": "Work-related?",
  "str_quest_chat_13384006": "Um... I'm playing games, actually...",
  "str_quest_chat_13384007": "Oh?",
  "str_quest_chat_13384008": "I'll get to bed after this game!",
  "str_quest_chat_13384009": "Well, I bid you a good night ahead of time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13385001": "Lumopolis has quite a view at night too.",
  "str_quest_chat_13385002": "So... Ms. Blanc would go and enjoy Lumopolis' scenery after work as well?",
  "str_quest_chat_13385003": "Are you really so curious about a lady's secrets, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_13385004": "N-No, that's not it...",
  "str_quest_chat_13385005": "It's just... W-We're friends, so I was curious!",
  "str_quest_chat_13385006": "Hahaha! I won't answer that question just yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_13385007": "But remember to look me up the next time you're in Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_13385008": "I'll show you some best night view spots in the city that only a Guide would know...",
  "str_quest_chat_13385009": "Looking forward to it...",
  "str_quest_chat_13386001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13386002": "There's something I wish to confirm with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13386003": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13386004": "This Colossus of yours, Soroz... Is there really no entry ticket system in place here?",
  "str_quest_chat_13386005": "Not at all, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_13386006": "Based on my observations, you're very fond of making friends, and will often go out of your way to help them.",
  "str_quest_chat_13386007": "As a result, you frequently allow your friends to come aboard at no charge. This courtesy extends to their friends, and the friends of their friends, as well...",
  "str_quest_chat_13386008": "Please don't misunderstand. This part of your personality is quite admirable.",
  "str_quest_chat_13386009": "I only fear that your blind generosity will be used against you someday, or worse... It may leave you penniless.",
  "str_quest_chat_13386010": "I never thought of it that way... No wonder I can never make ends meet!",
  "str_quest_chat_13386011": "If you ever wish to institute a boarding pass system here on Soroz, I would be more than happy to assist you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13386012": "Sure. Thanks, Ms. Blanc!",
  "str_quest_chat_13386013": "Don't mention it!",
  "str_quest_chat_13387001": "You're still awake, yes?",
  "str_quest_chat_13387002": "How did you know, Ms. Blanc?",
  "str_quest_chat_13387003": "I was going over the guide explanation of Soroz and I noticed that the lights were still on in your room.",
  "str_quest_chat_13387004": "So... Is there anything I can help you with?",
  "str_quest_chat_13387005": "It's really no big deal, it's just...",
  "str_quest_chat_13387006": "I have too much work to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_13387007": "Are you still working too, Ms. Blanc?",
  "str_quest_chat_13387008": "How are you still so full of energy after a full day's work?",
  "str_quest_chat_13387009": "When I first started working, I was very much like you: tired and stressed.",
  "str_quest_chat_13387010": "But over time, I realized that my work wasn't the source of my stress...",
  "str_quest_chat_13387011": "Rather, it was my constant fear of failure and self-doubt that caused me to feel so exhausted.",
  "str_quest_chat_13387012": "I have too much on my mind to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_13387013": "Don't you ever feel doubtful or troubled about things, Ms. Blanc?",
  "str_quest_chat_13387014": "How are you able to devote all of your attention to your work as you do?",
  "str_quest_chat_13387015": "When I was still a young girl, I was very much like you: tired and stressed.",
  "str_quest_chat_13387016": "But as I gained experience over the years, I eventually realized...",
  "str_quest_chat_13387017": "Feeling \"troubled,\" as you put it, does nothing to fix the problems in front of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13387018": "You're right... That makes total sense!",
  "str_quest_chat_13387019": "Nothing in this world is a life-or-death matter, you know? Well, except living and dying, of course...",
  "str_quest_chat_13387020": "So try to get some rest soon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13387021": "I will. Thanks, and have a good night, Ms. Blanc!",
  "str_quest_chat_13401001": "PlayerName, what do you think of Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_13401002": "It's a majestic city that floats in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_13401003": "Is that all?",
  "str_quest_chat_13401004": "It's the heart of civilization and the most amazing city on this land.",
  "str_quest_chat_13401005": "The heart of civilization...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13401006": "Let me ask you something else instead. Are you willing to live in Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_13401007": "Of course. It's very safe over there.",
  "str_quest_chat_13401008": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_13401009": "Although Lumopolis is wealthy and safe...",
  "str_quest_chat_13401010": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_13401011": "I must say though, Lumopolis isn't that nice to its civilians.",
  "str_quest_chat_13401012": "I think so too.",
  "str_quest_chat_13401013": "You... You agree with me? Aren't you a noble though?",
  "str_quest_chat_13401014": "Yes, but won't you admit it if you made a mistake?",
  "str_quest_chat_13401015": "I-I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_13401016": "I may be a noble, but it's not like I agree with how they handle things.",
  "str_quest_chat_13401017": "I see. I get it now.",
  "str_quest_chat_13401018": "I hope that you keep everything we said today between us.",
  "str_quest_chat_13401019": "I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_13401020": "Thanks, this is our secret.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402001": "How was your sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_13402002": "Not bad!",
  "str_quest_chat_13402003": "Ghost stories are all made up. I'm not scared.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402004": "But then again, Raphael was so scared of ghosts...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402005": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402006": "She was once startled by a patient that was following her and immediately attacked...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402007": "We all thought her shriek was a defense siren.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402008": "Although they scare her, she always urges others to tell more stories once she collects herself...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402009": "That's not good.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402010": "After that, I couldn't stop thinking about what Vice said...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402011": "The ghost would follow closely behind the protagonist, even when showering.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402012": "I stayed up until 3 am.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402013": "Looks like you can conjure up images in your mind based on those stories.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402014": "This is an outstanding ability, in some ways.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402015": "What do you think about the pajama party, Carleen?",
  "str_quest_chat_13402016": "Better than I thought.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402017": "We got to know each other better. Our different choices of pajamas reflect our personalities.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402018": "Gronru wears a loose and comfortable pajama with many gaudy patterns.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402019": "And Vice... Vice's bear pajamas are so adorable.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402020": "This is how I think pajamas should be.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402021": "Just imagine how cute it would be if we all sat together in fluffy animal pajamas!",
  "str_quest_chat_13402022": "Rabbit pajamas would look good on PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402023": "That won't be necessary, really...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402024": "Are you shy?",
  "str_quest_chat_13402025": "Squeak... Chirp... Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_13402026": "Uhh? What do rabbits say? I can't remember.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402027": "You sound excited.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402028": "And me...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402029": "Err...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402030": "Well, that outfit would actually suit me well...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402031": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402032": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_13402033": "Ah... It's nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_13402034": "I'm sorry, PlayerName. I've got things to do. See you around!",
  "str_quest_chat_13441001": "Hello, Navigator of the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13441002": "I hail from Lumopolis, the heart of all of Astra.",
  "str_quest_chat_13441003": "I hope we can become good friends starting today.",
  "str_quest_chat_13441004": "Sure, but... Actually, we're all good friends here on Soroz already.",
  "str_quest_chat_13441005": "So no need to force it, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_13441006": "You misunderstand. I say this so that you don't feel pressured.",
  "str_quest_chat_13441007": "Huh? Me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13441008": "Yes. As a member of Lumopolis, I may represent them on official matters in the near future.",
  "str_quest_chat_13441009": "At such times, you and I will be representing the Caelestites and Lumopolis, respectively.",
  "str_quest_chat_13441010": "So please, do not feel pressured.",
  "str_quest_chat_13441011": "I see... Very well.",
  "str_quest_chat_13441012": "That's what you say, but I'm already feeling the pressure...",
  "str_quest_chat_13442001": "Have you experienced anything like this, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_13442002": "Duties to fulfill, and lives to protect...",
  "str_quest_chat_13442003": "Having those things fills me with gratitude whenever I grow stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_13442004": "That gratitude empowers me to fulfill my duties and protect others from harm even more...",
  "str_quest_chat_13442005": "Me? I think so...",
  "str_quest_chat_13442006": "My desire to avenge my people...",
  "str_quest_chat_13442007": "And to protect all my friends here on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13442008": "That's right. You'll never lose your way with goals like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_13442009": "You'll work hard to improve yourself every day and get closer to your objective.",
  "str_quest_chat_13442010": "Only with a sharp and trained lance can we pierce through both our enemies and our own indecision!",
  "str_quest_chat_13442011": "Now then, since our goals align so well, why not help me train with my lance for a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_13442012": "That way, we can improve together!",
  "str_quest_chat_13442013": "Huh?! B-But I don't know how to use one...",
  "str_quest_chat_13442014": "We have a saying in Lumopolis: You must take your beatings first before learning to beat others!",
  "str_quest_chat_13442015": "You just made that up!!",
  "str_quest_chat_13451001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13451002": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_13451003": "Are you up?",
  "str_quest_chat_13451004": "I'm awake and ready for a great day!",
  "str_quest_chat_13451005": "Well, that's rare for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13451006": "... It's not that rare!",
  "str_quest_chat_13451007": "Well, have a nice day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13451008": "And the same to you, Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat_13452001": "It's quite hot in the Colossus this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13452002": "Ah, very true...",
  "str_quest_chat_13452003": "Maybe something is broken...",
  "str_quest_chat_13452004": "I'll send fireflies to check it out.",
  "str_quest_chat_13452005": "Ah, it's not that bad... I just wanted to ask...",
  "str_quest_chat_13452006": "Is it really okay for you to wear the same clothes all the time?",
  "str_quest_chat_13452007": "Ah... I'm used to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13452008": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_13453001": "Morning! You are up.",
  "str_quest_chat_13453002": "Please tell the fireflies...",
  "str_quest_chat_13453003": "They don't need to send breakfast to my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_13453004": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_13453005": "I'm not hungry.",
  "str_quest_chat_13453006": "Huh? You're not hungry?",
  "str_quest_chat_13453007": "That's right, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13453008": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_13454001": "You're up early today.",
  "str_quest_chat_13454002": "Ah... So are you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13454003": "I see you've become something of an early riser lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_13454004": "Want to experience the early hours of the day?",
  "str_quest_chat_13454005": "Yes, getting up early feels so refreshing.",
  "str_quest_chat_13454006": "That's right. And the day feels longer this way.",
  "str_quest_chat_13454007": "Yes, you're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_13455001": "It seems there's a lot of work to do today...",
  "str_quest_chat_13455002": "Fine, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_13455003": "You've been busy since early morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13455004": "Is it always like this?",
  "str_quest_chat_13455005": "Not really. I'm just spending a few days to overhaul our equipment.",
  "str_quest_chat_13455006": "I see. Well, it is important to take good care of the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_13455007": "I won't take up any more of your time then!",
  "str_quest_chat_13456001": "Ah... Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13456002": "Morning, Carleen... You look tired.",
  "str_quest_chat_13456003": "I could say the same about you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13456004": "Last night the Colossus turned over...",
  "str_quest_chat_13456005": "I was wondering why I dreamt that I was on a boat...",
  "str_quest_chat_13456006": "Please tell it to be gentler next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13456007": "I definitely will.",
  "str_quest_chat_13457001": "Did you hear anything this morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_13457002": "Probably the fireflies?",
  "str_quest_chat_13457003": "I... don't think so...",
  "str_quest_chat_13457004": "It was the Fireflies!",
  "str_quest_chat_13457005": "A firefly broke and was buzzing up and down the Corridor.",
  "str_quest_chat_13457006": "So I sent other fireflies to check on it!",
  "str_quest_chat_13458001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13458002": "Morning, Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat_13458003": "I seem to have found a candy in my pocket this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13458004": "Even though I can't recall when I did that...",
  "str_quest_chat_13458005": "I always think discoveries like these are a good way to start the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13458006": "Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_13458007": "So, let's do our best today!",
  "str_quest_chat_13459001": "Morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13459002": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13459003": "Have you ever heard of a stress relief method called \"focused breathing\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_13459004": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_13459005": "I believe it's some kind of training method that helps improves one's focus?",
  "str_quest_chat_13459006": "Correct.",
  "str_quest_chat_13459007": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat_13459008": "It's a type of training that helps you improve your focus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13459009": "If you find yourself distracted, try taking a couple of deep breaths first.",
  "str_quest_chat_13459010": "Just focus on your breathing... And that's the core of this training.",
  "str_quest_chat_13459011": "Got it. I'll give it a go.",
  "str_quest_chat_13461001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13461002": "Good afternoon. Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_13461003": "Hmm, I managed to grab a snack while working.",
  "str_quest_chat_13461004": "A snack... Will that be enough to keep you going?",
  "str_quest_chat_13461005": "I think so.",
  "str_quest_chat_13461006": "But since you know it's not ideal, please don't follow my example.",
  "str_quest_chat_13461007": "Make sure you eat well.",
  "str_quest_chat_13461008": "... I understand! Thanks for your concern!",
  "str_quest_chat_13461009": "Hmm.",
  "str_quest_chat_13462001": "Good afternoon. Are you taking a break?",
  "str_quest_chat_13462002": "I'm eating. This morning's work took a while...",
  "str_quest_chat_13462003": "Well, that's not good.",
  "str_quest_chat_13462004": "In order to ensure you have an adequate lunch break, I recommend that you endure to complete your morning work on time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13462005": "If the quality of your lunch break is affected due to a delay in your morning work, it will cause a further delay in the afternoon due to a poor quality lunch break.",
  "str_quest_chat_13462006": "This forms an apparent vicious cycle.",
  "str_quest_chat_13462007": "...Got it, Carleen!",
  "str_quest_chat_13462008": "No wonder you're a captain...",
  "str_quest_chat_13462009": "...Hmm. Goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat_13463001": "Good afternoon. Lunch break is almost over.",
  "str_quest_chat_13463002": "Good afternoon... Yes, it is almost over, Carleen...",
  "str_quest_chat_13463003": "Well, I suggest you get up now.",
  "str_quest_chat_13463004": "You shouldn't rest for too long.",
  "str_quest_chat_13463005": "...I'm up.",
  "str_quest_chat_13463006": "How about I order you a cup of coffee? You still seem a little sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_13463007": "No, it's okay... I'll be fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_13463008": "Thank you for reminding me, Carleen!",
  "str_quest_chat_13463009": "You're welcome.",
  "str_quest_chat_13464001": "It's already noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13464002": "Good afternoon, Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat_13464003": "PlayerName, do you take a nap every day?",
  "str_quest_chat_13464004": "Not every day...",
  "str_quest_chat_13464005": "What do you do at lunchtime if you're not napping?",
  "str_quest_chat_13464006": "Sometimes, I read.",
  "str_quest_chat_13464007": "And think.",
  "str_quest_chat_13464008": "Ah hah. Just like me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13465001": "How was lunch today?",
  "str_quest_chat_13465002": "It was fine... but not as good as yesterday's, though.",
  "str_quest_chat_13465003": "It must have been a different chef. Was it Vice?",
  "str_quest_chat_13465004": "I doubt it. I'll ask the fireflies later.",
  "str_quest_chat_13465005": "You're right. It probably wasn't Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_13465006": "It would have been way more disastrous if it was her in the kitchen.",
  "str_quest_chat_13466001": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_13466002": "Yeah. I made it myself so I know what it tastes like.",
  "str_quest_chat_13466003": "PlayerName cooks?",
  "str_quest_chat_13466004": "Err... It was just milk and toast.",
  "str_quest_chat_13466005": "Nothing fancy.",
  "str_quest_chat_13466006": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_13467001": "The midday sun is the best!",
  "str_quest_chat_13467002": "Yeah, so beautifully warm.",
  "str_quest_chat_13467003": "Sometimes, it's nice to just stand by the window and enjoy the sunshine!",
  "str_quest_chat_13467004": "Very different from Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_13467005": "I'm glad you like it!",
  "str_quest_chat_13468001": "There's just something about an afternoon nap on a cloudy day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13468002": "I couldn't agree more!",
  "str_quest_chat_13468003": "Snuggled up in bed with the clouds overhead... It's a great way to spend one's time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13468004": "Yup.",
  "str_quest_chat_13468005": "But once we've enjoyed such leisure, we shouldn't forget to get back to work.",
  "str_quest_chat_13468006": "Yep, you're right, as always.",
  "str_quest_chat_13469001": "Afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13469002": "Afternoon, Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat_13469003": "Hm, I don't really have anything to say.",
  "str_quest_chat_13469004": "But since I just passed by your room, I thought I'd say hi.",
  "str_quest_chat_13469005": "Ahaha, that's what this is.",
  "str_quest_chat_13469006": "Well, rest well then.",
  "str_quest_chat_13469007": "Alright. You rest well too, Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat_13481001": "Come see me in five minutes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13481002": "You want me to go to a girl's room so late at night...",
  "str_quest_chat_13481003": "Not okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_13481004": "Nope, I don't mean it like that. What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_13481005": "My light bulb went out. Can you change it for me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13482001": "Are you asleep, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_13482002": "Not yet, I still have a few things to take care of.",
  "str_quest_chat_13482003": "Try to get some rest; you can always deal with them in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13482004": "Ah, it's fine. I'm almost done, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_13482005": "But... Fine, just don't overdo it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13483001": "It's getting late.",
  "str_quest_chat_13483002": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_13483003": "Looking at the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_13483004": "I see... Contemplating your insignificance?",
  "str_quest_chat_13483005": "I'm reading.",
  "str_quest_chat_13483006": "This is a good bedtime habit.",
  "str_quest_chat_13483007": "But after completing this healthy habit, go to sleep early.",
  "str_quest_chat_13483008": "Alright. Good night, Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat_13483009": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13484001": "Are you there...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13484002": "I'm here!",
  "str_quest_chat_13484003": "Would you like to join me for a midnight snack?",
  "str_quest_chat_13484004": "Carleen... You're asking me if I want a midnight snack!?",
  "str_quest_chat_13484005": "Just tell me whether you want to or not.",
  "str_quest_chat_13484006": "No, I can't...",
  "str_quest_chat_13484007": "Huh? Why's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_13484008": "Well... It's personal...",
  "str_quest_chat_13484009": "I've just eaten. If I eat again, it'll be difficult for me to get to sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_13484010": "I see. We indeed shouldn't eat too much at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13484011": "Right. So, I'll just go to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_13484012": "Hmm. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13484013": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13485001": "It's time for bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_13485002": "Yes, good night, Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat_13485003": "PlayerName, what do you like to do before bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_13485004": "Read a relaxing book...",
  "str_quest_chat_13485005": "Or just lie there with my eyes closed.",
  "str_quest_chat_13485006": "Anything that helps me slow down and relax.",
  "str_quest_chat_13485007": "That way I can fall asleep in no time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13485008": "I see. I'll have to give it a try.",
  "str_quest_chat_13486001": "What would you do if you couldn't sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_13486002": "Recently I've been falling asleep as soon as my head touches the pillow...",
  "str_quest_chat_13486003": "You're really good at letting go.",
  "str_quest_chat_13486004": "Err... It's just the way I am.",
  "str_quest_chat_13486005": "Sometimes I imagine fireflies flying by my eyes...",
  "str_quest_chat_13486006": "Counting them always makes me sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_13486007": "You Caelestites know quite a few tricks, huh.",
  "str_quest_chat_13487001": "The sky is gorgeous tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_13487002": "I didn't notice earlier...",
  "str_quest_chat_13487003": "Always remember to pay attention to the world around you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13487004": "We tend to ignore the small things in life.",
  "str_quest_chat_13487005": "Carleen, don't you get to watch the night sky in Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_13487006": "I do but it just feels very special tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_13487007": "Probably because I'm on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13487008": "It's a different angle...",
  "str_quest_chat_13488001": "How's your day going, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_13488002": "Alright, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat_13488003": "Not bad.",
  "str_quest_chat_13488004": "I read something from a book today.",
  "str_quest_chat_13488005": "\"A day without laughter is a day wasted.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_13488006": "It sounds a bit preachy, but it also kind of makes sense.",
  "str_quest_chat_13488007": "Hmm... Yes, it does make sense.",
  "str_quest_chat_13488008": "So, no matter what kind of day we're having...",
  "str_quest_chat_13488009": "I hope the next day will be one filled with laughter.",
  "str_quest_chat_13489001": "I'm a little conflicted, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13489002": "Hmm? What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_13489003": "I just had an ice cream.",
  "str_quest_chat_13489004": "Even though I know eating it right before bed isn't good for one's health.",
  "str_quest_chat_13489005": "But... Ahem.",
  "str_quest_chat_13489006": "Now I want another one.",
  "str_quest_chat_13489007": "Well, what's there to be conflicted about? Just eat one if that's what you want.",
  "str_quest_chat_13489008": "It's just ice cream, Carleen. There's no need to overthink this!",
  "str_quest_chat_13489009": "Hmm... I suppose you're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_13489010": "Well, I'm off to eat my ice cream then. Goodnight, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13489011": "Hurry on.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501001": "PlayerName, I found something that you might find useful.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501002": "Oh, what is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13501003": "Some books. Do you like reading?",
  "str_quest_chat_13501004": "Yes, I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501005": "Yep! You can learn a lot from books.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501006": "Yeah, but there aren't many books on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_13501007": "I prefer to work in the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501008": "Sometimes, you need knowledge that books can provide to assist you in work.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501009": "You made a good point...",
  "str_quest_chat_13501010": "So, I've found you several books.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501011": "What are they about?",
  "str_quest_chat_13501012": "History, geography, the humanities, and more.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501013": "I'll get someone to bring them to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501014": "Thanks then.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501015": "Remember to read them. I'll come over to check up on you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13501016": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_13502001": "Another peaceful day...",
  "str_quest_chat_13502002": "Is something troubling you, Queen Bethlehem?",
  "str_quest_chat_13502003": "Hmm? It seems you are far more intuitive than others, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_13502004": "I expect nothing less from someone for whom I have such high hopes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13502005": "Then... What's on your mind, Your Majesty?",
  "str_quest_chat_13502006": "I was only thinking about those Northland nights, nothing more.",
  "str_quest_chat_13502007": "Sitting in the boundless snow land...",
  "str_quest_chat_13502008": "The light of the aurora as my only companion...",
  "str_quest_chat_13502009": "It sounds beautiful, as a little lonely...",
  "str_quest_chat_13502010": "Oh? Are you very familiar with loneliness, then?",
  "str_quest_chat_13502011": "I wouldn't say very familiar, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_13502012": "But I used to think I was pretty lonely, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_13502013": "I surmise you no longer feel this way, am I correct?",
  "str_quest_chat_13502014": "That's right! Nothing gets past you, Your Majesty.",
  "str_quest_chat_13502015": "I share your sentiments. Ever since we met...",
  "str_quest_chat_13502016": "I feel as though the future has opened up right before my eyes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13502017": "So thank you, Navigator... For not letting me feel lonely ever again.",
  "str_quest_chat_13502018": "D-Don't mention it...",
  "str_quest_chat_13503001": "Have you ever considered what the future will be like?",
  "str_quest_chat_13503002": "Yeah... I think about what the future has in stock for us all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13503003": "I think...",
  "str_quest_chat_13503004": "The future will be peaceful.",
  "str_quest_chat_13503005": "And completely free from the threat of Eclipsites.",
  "str_quest_chat_13503006": "But there will always be war and strife...",
  "str_quest_chat_13503007": "Even if we manage to wipe out every Eclipsite in the world, a new threat is bound to take its place.",
  "str_quest_chat_13503008": "I see my judgement was correct.",
  "str_quest_chat_13503009": "Even if your viewpoint is still a bit immature...",
  "str_quest_chat_13503010": "It is still a clear reflection of your growth and your ability to see the greater picture.",
  "str_quest_chat_13503011": "Thank you, Your Majesty. I couldn't have grown this much without your constant guidance.",
  "str_quest_chat_13503012": "So... Have you given thought to your own future, as well?",
  "str_quest_chat_13503013": "My own future...",
  "str_quest_chat_13503014": "Not really, now that I think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13503015": "That is perfectly fine, take all the time you need to think on it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13503016": "But if in the future...",
  "str_quest_chat_13503017": "There will always be a place for you in the Winter Palace.",
  "str_quest_chat_13503018": "R-Really? ...Thank you, Queen Bethlehem.",
  "str_quest_chat_13504001": "PlayerName, are you busy at the moment?",
  "str_quest_chat_13504002": "Could I ask you for a favor?",
  "str_quest_chat_13504003": "Whatever you need, please feel free to ask me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13504004": "Very well.",
  "str_quest_chat_13504005": "Please come to the bridge, and I will tell you in person.",
  "str_quest_chat_13504999": "What could Queen Bethlehem possibly want with you? Go to the bridge to find out.",
  "str_quest_chat_13541001": "Although I am Queen of the North, I have no intention of maintaining such a lofty attitude here.",
  "str_quest_chat_13541002": "So please, no need to be so nervous.",
  "str_quest_chat_13541003": "Oh! D-Do I look n-nervous...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13541004": "Well, your hands were sweating and trembling while you were making our tea.",
  "str_quest_chat_13541005": "You even spilled some on my dress.",
  "str_quest_chat_13541006": "Ah!!! Forgive me, it's just... I hardly ever make tea for others...",
  "str_quest_chat_13541007": "It's our first time meeting, so maybe I am a little nervous...",
  "str_quest_chat_13541008": "Please don't be. I am your equal, and I have very high hopes for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13541009": "So, please... Don't disappoint me. No more trembling, now steel your hands and your heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_13541010": "Okay... I understand!",
  "str_quest_chat_13541011": "Although I'm not very sure why you have such hopes for me...",
  "str_quest_chat_13541012": "When the time comes, you will know.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542001": "I can sense... A new source of power manifesting within me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542002": "This is the first time I have felt such power... It's incredible.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542003": "I feel a mysterious power coming from you as well, Queen Bethlehem...",
  "str_quest_chat_13542004": "I saw you once before. Were you practicing your swordsmanship in secret?",
  "str_quest_chat_13542005": "It is one of my interests, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542006": "Though I was not training in secret. I just haven't had a chance to use it for a long time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542007": "At any rate, you're incredibly talented...",
  "str_quest_chat_13542008": "Your close friend was once a pupil of mine, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542009": "You mean Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_13542010": "Me? Train a Colossus? Though the idea intrigues me...",
  "str_quest_chat_13542011": "But the Colossus itself possesses great wisdom and knowledge, far exceeding my own.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542012": "In my interactions with Soroz, it was I who played the student.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542013": "I was just kidding.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542014": "Then... Is it Louise?",
  "str_quest_chat_13542015": "Louise is like a newly-formed snowflake: pure, beautiful, and intricate...",
  "str_quest_chat_13542016": "But she possesses unlimited potential.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542017": "I have assigned to her the task of record keeper, but soon enough she will play a leading role in our story...",
  "str_quest_chat_13542018": "She is a person in whom I trust wholeheartedly, but she was never my pupil.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542019": "Then that means, your pupil is...",
  "str_quest_chat_13542020": "It is not yet time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13542021": "Again? I-I mean... I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_13543001": "Do you remember the long sword that I often carry on my person?",
  "str_quest_chat_13543002": "Th-That's a sword?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13543003": "I always thought it was your royal scepter!",
  "str_quest_chat_13543004": "It is my scepter as well as my weapon, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13543005": "But its title matters not in comparison to the power that lies within it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13543006": "I remember it being covered in star-like decorations.",
  "str_quest_chat_13543007": "Sometimes, I can see its reflection in the light. It looked exactly like the aurora...",
  "str_quest_chat_13543008": "It must house the power of the stars themselves!",
  "str_quest_chat_13543009": "Perhaps I mentioned it before, but your imagination is quite extraordinary.",
  "str_quest_chat_13543010": "It must house the power of the aurora itself!",
  "str_quest_chat_13543011": "How perceptive of you to have come to this realization.",
  "str_quest_chat_13543012": "To be honest, I wanted to express my gratitude to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13543013": "Thanks in no small part to you, it has grown even more powerful.",
  "str_quest_chat_13543014": "Do I really have that kind of influence...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13543015": "After all that has happened, you still doubt yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_13543016": "In my opinion, your influence is enough to impact the entire world.",
  "str_quest_chat_13543017": "I don't know why I feel so undeserving of the praise...",
  "str_quest_chat_13543018": "But I promise I'll do my best to live up to your expectations!",
  "str_quest_chat_13544001": "Greetings, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_13544002": "Tell me, what is your impression of Northland?",
  "str_quest_chat_13544003": "It's... Cold... And tranquil.",
  "str_quest_chat_13544004": "Fair enough, considering the vast majority of Northland lies within snow-capped mountain ranges.",
  "str_quest_chat_13544005": "But even under the harshest winter conditions, the people of Northland can still live happy, prosperous lives.",
  "str_quest_chat_13544006": "Peaceful, and free...",
  "str_quest_chat_13544007": "Indeed, my people find joy in kindness and simplicity.",
  "str_quest_chat_13544008": "In addition, Northland is seldom terrorized by Eclipsite attacks.",
  "str_quest_chat_13544009": "This must be one of your proudest achievements, Queen Bethlehem.",
  "str_quest_chat_13544010": "Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown...",
  "str_quest_chat_13544011": "I agree... None of this could have come easily!",
  "str_quest_chat_13544012": "They say that, as the sole ruler of Northland...",
  "str_quest_chat_13544013": "You work tirelessly for the good of your people, and have sacrificed so much for them.",
  "str_quest_chat_13544014": "The past is the past.",
  "str_quest_chat_13544015": "As for the present, an even greater power has awakened within me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13544016": "Perhaps someday, you and I will...",
  "str_quest_chat_13544017": "You and I...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13544018": "You and I will see the future of this world together.",
  "str_quest_chat_13551001": "Good morning. You ought to come see the sunrise.",
  "str_quest_chat_13551002": "You're awake awfully early, Your Majesty...",
  "str_quest_chat_13551003": "An undisturbed dawn...",
  "str_quest_chat_13551004": "It is a luxury I can seldom afford to enjoy.",
  "str_quest_chat_13551005": "What will you do this morning, Your Majesty?",
  "str_quest_chat_13551006": "I could exercise or perhaps do some light reading... Both are equally wonderful options.",
  "str_quest_chat_13551007": "I should do the same!",
  "str_quest_chat_13552001": "The winds of awakening are blowing...",
  "str_quest_chat_13552002": "Hmm? Do you feel a draft inside the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_13552003": "Come outside, and you will understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_13552004": "But it's so early, Your Majesty... What are you doing outside at this hour?",
  "str_quest_chat_13552005": "I just finished practicing my swordsmanship.",
  "str_quest_chat_13552006": "Now I am preparing to sort out my affairs for the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13552007": "Does that mean you've been awake for a long time now...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13552008": "Indeed. Are you... still in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_13552009": "N-No, I've been up for a while!",
  "str_quest_chat_13553001": "Good morning, my expected one.",
  "str_quest_chat_13553002": "Good morning, Your Majesty!",
  "str_quest_chat_13553003": "Oh? Already awake, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_13553004": "It seems you are not as slothful as others say.",
  "str_quest_chat_13553005": "Actually, I'm still in bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_13553006": "Were you working late last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_13553007": "Do not be troubled. I admire your willingness to acknowledge your own shortcomings.",
  "str_quest_chat_13553008": "Just trying to be more like you, Your Majesty!",
  "str_quest_chat_13553009": "I didn't realize how much time there was in a day until I started waking up earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_13553010": "And I have more time to read the books you recommended.",
  "str_quest_chat_13553011": "You never fail to surpass my expectations.",
  "str_quest_chat_13554001": "A cup of tea to start a peaceful day...",
  "str_quest_chat_13554002": "Do you always take your tea this early in the morning, Your Majesty?",
  "str_quest_chat_13554003": "Yes. Does this surprise you?",
  "str_quest_chat_13554004": "N-Not at all! I just thought you only drank tea in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13554005": "Perhaps my fondness for tea has gotten a bit out of hand... I find myself drinking it well into the night these days.",
  "str_quest_chat_13554006": "I suppose I could liken it to those who drink coffee regularly.",
  "str_quest_chat_13554007": "I see... Do you also drink it to stay awake, Your Majesty?",
  "str_quest_chat_13554008": "While drinking tea does produce a stimulating effect on the senses...",
  "str_quest_chat_13554009": "For me, its greatest appeal lies in its taste.",
  "str_quest_chat_13554010": "Even the same tea can taste differently, depending on the time of day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13554011": "Take this cup of tea, for instance. This morning, its taste reminds me of the morning dew glistening in the trees as birds sing to herald the coming day...",
  "str_quest_chat_13554012": "Wow... I have no idea what that would even taste like!",
  "str_quest_chat_13555001": "Tell me, did you hear the birds chirping this morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_13555002": "Uh... I think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_13555003": "I thought I was just dreaming it, though...",
  "str_quest_chat_13555004": "It was no dream.",
  "str_quest_chat_13555005": "Did birds fly inside because I forgot to close a door somewhere?",
  "str_quest_chat_13555006": "Not at all... The birds you heard were here at my behest.",
  "str_quest_chat_13555007": "I invited them here to teach me their singing techniques.",
  "str_quest_chat_13555008": "Coincidentally, I realized that their song is perfect for waking even the laziest of people from their slumber.",
  "str_quest_chat_13555009": "So I had the Fireflies record their song for future use.",
  "str_quest_chat_13555010": "Now, you can wake up to the beautiful sound of birds singing every morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13555011": "Pardon me, Your Majesty... But are you trying to say I'm lazy?",
  "str_quest_chat_13556001": "Were you trapped in your dream again last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_13556002": "How did you know, Your Majesty? It's true, I had a really long dream last night...",
  "str_quest_chat_13556003": "If you must know...",
  "str_quest_chat_13556004": "In the fragmented visions of the future that reveal themselves to me... I see many that concern you, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_13556005": "One such vision made itself very clear to me last night. A powerful vision...",
  "str_quest_chat_13556006": "Then does that mean you know what I was dreaming about, Your Majesty?",
  "str_quest_chat_13556007": "... To a certain extent, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13556008": "You were dreaming of loved ones, weren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_13556009": "Why else would you dream of a reunion with your parents and siblings?",
  "str_quest_chat_13556010": "Sigh... Right again, Your Majesty. No matter how hard I work to rebuild Eraveil, there's no bringing back my family or my people...",
  "str_quest_chat_13556011": "You poor, poor child...",
  "str_quest_chat_13556012": "Remember, Northland will always be your home.",
  "str_quest_chat_13556013": "And Northland people will also be your people, your family.",
  "str_quest_chat_13556014": "Sigh...",
  "str_quest_chat_13556015": "Thank you for the kind words, Your Majesty.",
  "str_quest_chat_13557001": "The morning goes by in a blink of an eye. Make the most of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13557002": "Tell me, PlayerName... What is your plan for today?",
  "str_quest_chat_13557003": "Sword training!",
  "str_quest_chat_13557004": "Oh? Why have you decided to learn the way of the sword?",
  "str_quest_chat_13557005": "I realized that not only is it a great form of exercise... It's also a great form of self-defense!",
  "str_quest_chat_13557006": "Which means that someday... I might be able to stand on the battlefield with everyone else.",
  "str_quest_chat_13557007": "So your goal is to enter battle?",
  "str_quest_chat_13557008": "Er, n-not exactly, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_13557009": "If you truly intend to set foot on the battlefield, you must first find something you wish to protect.",
  "str_quest_chat_13557010": "Reading!",
  "str_quest_chat_13557011": "Oh? What will you be reading?",
  "str_quest_chat_13557012": "Just some new books I picked up about ways to fight Eclipsites.",
  "str_quest_chat_13557013": "After they destroyed Eraveil...",
  "str_quest_chat_13557014": "I want to make them pay for everything they've done to us!",
  "str_quest_chat_13557015": "Have you forgotten already?",
  "str_quest_chat_13557016": "Vengeance is not a reason for which to fight.",
  "str_quest_chat_13557017": "As you continue your studies, remember to ask yourself why you are doing so, and reflect on your answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_13557018": "I will. Thanks for reminding me, Your Majesty!",
  "str_quest_chat_13558001": "\"Ice crystals glistening brilliantly in the morning sun...\"",
  "str_quest_chat_13558002": "Tell me, my Caelestite friend... Do you believe these lyrics describe Northland and its natural beauty?",
  "str_quest_chat_13558003": "Well, it does sound like Northland to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_13558004": "Wait, this song...",
  "str_quest_chat_13558005": "I remember it now!",
  "str_quest_chat_13558006": "It's the one written by that genius songwriter from Umbraton! The one you like!",
  "str_quest_chat_13558007": "Correct.",
  "str_quest_chat_13558008": "I don't recall...",
  "str_quest_chat_13558009": "This song was written by a genius songwriter from Umbraton, one whom I admire very much.",
  "str_quest_chat_13558010": "However... The song's original melody has long since been lost to the passage of time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13558011": "Do you think the songwriter ever traveled to Northland in her day?",
  "str_quest_chat_13558012": "Perhaps... But even if she never did, I believe that Northland held a special place in her heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_13558013": "Otherwise, she could never have written such evocative lyrics...",
  "str_quest_chat_13558014": "Someday, I would like to ask for everyone's help in composing a new melody for these lyrics, so that her song can continue to pass from generation to generation.",
  "str_quest_chat_13558015": "The Caelestites were known for their love of music... Perhaps you can lend me your aid as well?",
  "str_quest_chat_13558016": "S-Sure! I'd love to help!",
  "str_quest_chat_13559001": "A new day has come... Whose life shall I experience today?",
  "str_quest_chat_13559002": "Uh... experience?",
  "str_quest_chat_13559003": "Oh... Now I remember! You've been reading famous biographies again, haven't you, Your Majesty?",
  "str_quest_chat_13559004": "Indeed. The biography of that famous Umbraton singer left quite a profound impression on me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13559005": "Perhaps I shall read her biography a second time instead of choosing a new book?",
  "str_quest_chat_13559006": "Your Majesty must enjoy music as much as reading, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_13559007": "You are the expert when it comes to music, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13559008": "When I finally decide to write a song of my own, may I ask you to listen to it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13559009": "Huh?! I-It would be my honor!",
  "str_quest_chat_13561001": "I believe an afternoon respite is in order, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_13561002": "Thank you for the reminder, Your Majesty, but I just woke up from a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_13561003": "Are you in the habit of sleeping in the afternoon, then?",
  "str_quest_chat_13561004": "Yep! It keeps me awake in the evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_13561005": "Otherwise, I'll feel tired for the rest of the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13561006": "No, I was just a little tired today...",
  "str_quest_chat_13561007": "If you feel tired, I can give the order...",
  "str_quest_chat_13561008": "To change your afternoon tea for something stronger, like coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat_13561009": "Th-Thank you, Your Majesty.",
  "str_quest_chat_13562001": "The day is halfway done. How is your work coming along?",
  "str_quest_chat_13562002": "Great, actually! Today's been really productive!",
  "str_quest_chat_13562003": "Wonderful! I expected nothing less from you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_13562004": "I don't know why, but today hasn't been too productive...",
  "str_quest_chat_13562005": "Do not fret, Navigator. There is still half a day left to make things right.",
  "str_quest_chat_13562006": "Although it does help to rest every now and again.",
  "str_quest_chat_13562007": "Do you ever take breaks, Queen Bethlehem?",
  "str_quest_chat_13562008": "Of course. I am doing so right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_13562009": "I am enjoying a nice cup of afternoon tea myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_13563001": "Answer me truthfully, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_13563002": "Have you read the books that I gave you in their entirety?",
  "str_quest_chat_13563003": "I just got done reading the first one!",
  "str_quest_chat_13563004": "Hmm... Your progress is... somewhat slower than I expected.",
  "str_quest_chat_13563005": "Nevertheless, it is a satisfactory start.",
  "str_quest_chat_13563006": "The first step is always the hardest, but I'll keep trying my best!",
  "str_quest_chat_13563007": "The hardest part is not doing the readings, so much as it is putting their knowledge into practice.",
  "str_quest_chat_13563008": "When you put it that way, it gets a little more confusing...",
  "str_quest_chat_13563009": "After all, how am I supposed to put A Record of Afternoon Tea and its Cuisine into practice...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13563010": "Now how did one of my private diaries end up in that collection of books I gave you...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13564001": "PlayerName, what books have you been reading lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_13564002": "Uh... daily schedule manuals?",
  "str_quest_chat_13564003": "They are not real books, and they can't bring you the gift of knowledge.",
  "str_quest_chat_13564004": "I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I've been busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_13564005": "You need to arrange your schedule, since you have much riding on you...",
  "str_quest_chat_13564006": "I-I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_13564007": "It's your fate, so embrace it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13565001": "Excuse me. How good are you with a sword?",
  "str_quest_chat_13565002": "Not good at all...",
  "str_quest_chat_13565003": "I can swing a sword...",
  "str_quest_chat_13565004": "I see. But your skill level is inadequate.",
  "str_quest_chat_13565005": "I should find you a trainer.",
  "str_quest_chat_13565006": "Why do you wish me to learn swordsmanship, Your Majesty?",
  "str_quest_chat_13565007": "Your future may be filled with dangers... You must know how to protect yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_13565008": "Sure. I'll find someone to train me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13565009": "Please keep it up, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13566001": "Nice weather outside.",
  "str_quest_chat_13566002": "We must pick our heads up from our busy daily chores every now and then.",
  "str_quest_chat_13566003": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_13566004": "We all need breaks and downtime.",
  "str_quest_chat_13566005": "I'll do that right now, Your Majesty!",
  "str_quest_chat_13566006": "Don't get so uptight. It's not an order.",
  "str_quest_chat_13566007": "It's rare for the weather to be so nice. I just want everyone to enjoy it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13566008": "Understood. I'll look out the window before my afternoon nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_13566009": "It will be good for the eyes, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_13566010": "I shall leave you to it, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_13566011": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_13567001": "PlayerName, what kind of dreams do you have?",
  "str_quest_chat_13567002": "Huh? Dreams? Lots of different ones, I guess. All weird.",
  "str_quest_chat_13567003": "Sometimes I dream of boring everyday things. Sometimes of bizarre adventures.",
  "str_quest_chat_13567004": "But I mostly forget them as soon as I wake up.",
  "str_quest_chat_13567005": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_13567006": "Then I hope your dreams are always as peaceful as the ones you have now.",
  "str_quest_chat_13568001": "Good afternoon, my esteemed audience.",
  "str_quest_chat_13568002": "Er... G-Good afternoon, Your Majesty!",
  "str_quest_chat_13568003": "Something tells me you read the Umbraton singer's biography again...",
  "str_quest_chat_13568004": "Correct.",
  "str_quest_chat_13568005": "For some reason, whenever I picture myself as her...",
  "str_quest_chat_13568006": "I'm filled with an unrestrained sense of freedom.",
  "str_quest_chat_13568007": "I would have loved to meet her if she was still alive... We might have even been friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_13568008": "I never would've imagined you'd find a person like that in a book, Your Majesty.",
  "str_quest_chat_13568009": "I was under the impression that you felt the same about her, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13568010": "Besides, I need not turn to books to make dear friends... Not when I have you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13568011": "I-I still don't think I'm worthy of the title, Your Majesty...",
  "str_quest_chat_13568012": "Then you fail to see yourself as clearly as I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_13568013": "But when the time comes, all will be made clear to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13568014": "Ahh?",
  "str_quest_chat_13569001": "How are you faring now that half the day has gone by?",
  "str_quest_chat_13569002": "Not well, to be honest...",
  "str_quest_chat_13569003": "For some reason, I just don't feel as productive as usual.",
  "str_quest_chat_13569004": "Perhaps what you lack is a sense of urgency?",
  "str_quest_chat_13569005": "Allow me to provide it for you... If you fail to finish your tasks for the morning, then you will forfeit your lunch for the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13569006": "Th-That's too much, Your Majesty!",
  "str_quest_chat_13569007": "I feel great!",
  "str_quest_chat_13569008": "I'm just about done with everything on my list for the time being.",
  "str_quest_chat_13569009": "I see. It fills my heart with pride to see you improving so much with each passing day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13569010": "You have my blessing to enjoy a well-earned lunch break.",
  "str_quest_chat_13569011": "Th-Thank you, Your Majesty!",

  "str_quest_chat_13581003": "You have to always be in your best condition to deal with the upcoming battles.",
  "str_quest_chat_13581004": "You're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_13581005": "Do you still insist on sleeping at such an early hour?",
  "str_quest_chat_13581006": "... It's already deep in the night!",
  "str_quest_chat_13582001": "Even from atop a Colossus, the night sky is no different from the one above Northland...",
  "str_quest_chat_13582002": "I'm sorry...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13582003": "No matter where we are, our mission remains the same. I was merely expressing that sentiment.",

  "str_quest_chat_13583001": "How are your studies on monarchism coming along?",
  "str_quest_chat_13583002": "Oh, uh... A-About that...",
  "str_quest_chat_13583003": "What's the matter? Why are you so nervous?",
  "str_quest_chat_13583004": "Why do I have to learn about monarchism, anyway?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13584001": "The night has come...",
  "str_quest_chat_13584002": "You're still awake too, Queen Bethlehem?",
  "str_quest_chat_13584003": "You are still awake. What is on your mind?",
  "str_quest_chat_13584004": "It's... about the Eclipsites.",
  "str_quest_chat_13584005": "I believe that is just a part of your future.",
  "str_quest_chat_13584006": "A part of my future?",
  "str_quest_chat_13584007": "Yes. In my opinion, you should occupy your thoughts with more than just that.",
  "str_quest_chat_13584008": "Oh... Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_13585001": "Come, let us step into the dark of night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13585002": "By that, Your Majesty, do you mean...",
  "str_quest_chat_13585003": "To go for a walk... at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_13585004": "There is no need to interpret my words so literally, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_13585005": "Reading, training, thinking, or yes, taking a walk...",
  "str_quest_chat_13585006": "As long as it is a meaningful use of your time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13585007": "A meaningful use of time... In that case, I choose to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_13585008": "A superb choice for someone so young in their years. Pleasant dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_13585009": "Good night, Your Majesty.",
  "str_quest_chat_13586001": "Have you gone to sleep yet, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_13586002": "Not yet, no. Is something the matter, Queen Bethlehem?",
  "str_quest_chat_13586003": "Not at all, quite frankly.",
  "str_quest_chat_13586004": "I simply wished to tell you that the night sky is particularly beautiful tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_13586005": "Oh, I thought you were going to remind me to do more reading, Your Majesty...",
  "str_quest_chat_13586006": "If you require someone to remind you to study...",
  "str_quest_chat_13586007": "Then perhaps it is already too late.",
  "str_quest_chat_13586008": "I am certain you will not disappoint me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13586009": "I-I wouldn't dream of it... I'll keep doing my best, Your Majesty!",
  "str_quest_chat_13586010": "Naturally, remember to take the time to gaze at the night sky every so often, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_13587001": "It's best to think at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13587002": "I agree. I also read at night sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13587003": "What other way do you exercise your brain aside from reading?",
  "str_quest_chat_13587004": "Organizing the next day's schedule, sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13587005": "Or do a review on past events...",
  "str_quest_chat_13587006": "Self-reflection is a good habit to have.",
  "str_quest_chat_13587007": "It makes you aware of your mistakes and prevents you from making them again.",
  "str_quest_chat_13587008": "Do you also do it often, Your Majesty?",
  "str_quest_chat_13587009": "Indeed. I have a lot of time and methods to reflect on myself...",
  "str_quest_chat_13588001": "You should get some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_13588002": "Yes, I'm feeling a bit tired.",
  "str_quest_chat_13588003": "Please stop checking the terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat_13588004": "And go to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_13588005": "...You got me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13588006": "It's to be expected.",
  "str_quest_chat_13588007": "Cherish the time you have to sleep, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13588008": "Okay, you have a point.",
  "str_quest_chat_13588009": "Good night, Your Majesty.",
  "str_quest_chat_13589001": "The stars have risen as usual.",
  "str_quest_chat_13589002": "Their paths are fated. Yours is not yet certain.",
  "str_quest_chat_13589003": "What's that meant to mean...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13589004": "Your future holds countless possibilities. So keep moving forward.",
  "str_quest_chat_13589005": "Keep searching for the future you desire.",
  "str_quest_chat_13589006": "I'll do my best...",
  "str_quest_chat_13590001": "Answer me, observed one.",
  "str_quest_chat_13590002": "It's late. Why are you not asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_13590003": "Well, I still have work to do...",
  "str_quest_chat_13590004": "I don't want to leave it until tomorrow. So I'm working into the night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13590005": "You are dedicated to your work. An admirable quality.",
  "str_quest_chat_13590006": "But you must not tire yourself out.",
  "str_quest_chat_13590007": "Well, I had some coffee earlier...",
  "str_quest_chat_13590008": "So I couldn't sleep even if I wanted to...",
  "str_quest_chat_13590009": "Then I will have to remind you not to drink coffee so late in the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13590010": "Sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_13590011": "Don't stay up too late.",
  "str_quest_chat_13590012": "Your future still awaits you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13590013": "Good night, Your Majesty.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601001": "Oh... How did that happen.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601002": "What's up? Nemesis?",
  "str_quest_chat_13601003": "I won a prize, but I don't want it at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601004": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_13601005": "Well, it's made of glass.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601006": "Maybe you can give it to someone else then.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601007": "Oh? You don't want it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13601008": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13601009": "It's a set of glassware.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601010": "Glassware?",
  "str_quest_chat_13601011": "Yes. They glitter but are also a little fragile.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601012": "When I look at it, I sometimes think of the spark of justice in people's hearts...",
  "str_quest_chat_13601013": "That's really fragile.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601014": "Justice?",
  "str_quest_chat_13601015": "Yes, as a supervisor, I've witnessed too much injustice.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601016": "Although I've tried my best to be fair...",
  "str_quest_chat_13601017": "But...",
  "str_quest_chat_13601018": "Nemesis... Don't force yourself too much.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601019": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_13601020": "Ah!",
  "str_quest_chat_13601021": "What is it? Are you okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_13601022": "Nothing... I just broke another one of the glassware.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601023": "I see... I understand now.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601024": "From now on, I'll keep all of your glassware prizes safe for you. Leave them to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13601025": "In that case... thank you in advance.",
  "str_quest_chat_13602001": "Hey Navigator, do you have some time to talk about something?",
  "str_quest_chat_13602002": "Sure... What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13602003": "Relax, it's nothing crazy. I promise.",
  "str_quest_chat_13602004": "Alright then.",
  "str_quest_chat_13602005": "I'll be waiting for you on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_13602999": "It seems Nemesis wants to discuss something with me. I should go to the bridge and find her.",
  "str_quest_chat_13641001": "Hello, Navigator of the Colossus! How would you define \"justice\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_13641002": "Justice? Hmm... It's what allows good people to prosper.",
  "str_quest_chat_13641003": "I see!",
  "str_quest_chat_13641004": "Alright, next question! Would you say the \"good people\" of Lumopolis have prospered?",
  "str_quest_chat_13641005": "Justice? Hmm... It's what punishes the evil and the wicked.",
  "str_quest_chat_13641006": "I see!",
  "str_quest_chat_13641007": "Alright, next question! Would you say that the existence of Lumopolis is a kind of evil?",
  "str_quest_chat_13641008": "Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_13641009": "I'm not from Lumopolis, so I can't say...",
  "str_quest_chat_13641010": "It's hard to answer a question like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_13641011": "Perfect. I'm more than satisfied with that answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_13641012": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_13641013": "Carrying out justice is a very serious matter.",
  "str_quest_chat_13641014": "Without a deep understanding of it, justice can be warped and exploited by the powerful to fit their selfish agendas!",
  "str_quest_chat_13641015": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_13641016": "So, please... Be aware of this and exercise caution as you carry out justice.",
  "str_quest_chat_13641017": "I will do my best to keep you from straying from the right path!",
  "str_quest_chat_13651001": "Good morning! You should already be up by now!",
  "str_quest_chat_13651002": "Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_13651003": "Still sleepy?",
  "str_quest_chat_13651004": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_13651005": "Wake up, already! Get yourself a cup of coffee, or something!",
  "str_quest_chat_13651006": "I'm awake, I'm awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_13651007": "Really? Well, that's alight then.",
  "str_quest_chat_13651008": "Heroes like us should start each day with a clear head!",
  "str_quest_chat_13651009": "It's so early and you're already so energetic, Nemesis...",
  "str_quest_chat_13652001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_13652002": "The trumpet has sounded. Don't tell me you're still in bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_13652003": "But I'm not an Illumina soldier...",
  "str_quest_chat_13652004": "Why do I still need to get up so early?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13653001": "A day's plan starts with the dawn.",
  "str_quest_chat_13653002": "Getting up early is the first right thing to do!",
  "str_quest_chat_13653003": "So, PlayerName, my dear friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_13653004": "Are you awake yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_13653005": "I'm awake!",
  "str_quest_chat_13653006": "Perfect! I expect nothing less from my comrade of justice!",
  "str_quest_chat_13653007": "Now that both of us are in peak mental condition, let's attack the day and work with all of our hearts!",
  "str_quest_chat_13653008": "Yeah!",
  "str_quest_chat_13653009": "Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_13653010": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_13653011": "Do I need to go to your room and carry out justice?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13653012": "N-No, don't! I'll get up right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_13654001": "Good morning, comrade of justice!",
  "str_quest_chat_13654002": "Morning, Nemesis.",
  "str_quest_chat_13654003": "Would you like to see my observation report for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_13654004": "\"Observation report\"...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13654005": "Name: PlayerName, Race: Caelestite, Birthplace: Eraveil...",
  "str_quest_chat_13654006": "Has an unstable monthly income despite generating massive expenses. Often unable to make ends meet...",
  "str_quest_chat_13654007": "J-Just stop!",
  "str_quest_chat_13654008": "When did you start \"observing\" me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13654009": "From the very moment I first met you, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_13654010": "Justice never sleeps, and neither do I when it comes to my observations!",
  "str_quest_chat_13654011": "Okay, but you still shouldn't take shots at people like this. Especially not their finances...",
  "str_quest_chat_13654012": "But it was only because of my observations that I determined you were a trustworthy and dependable comrade of justice!",
  "str_quest_chat_13654013": "Just because you're not a wealthy comrade of justice doesn't mean you should be embarrassed by it!",
  "str_quest_chat_13654014": "Compared to all of those black-hearted rich people, you're far more worthy of respect and admiration!",
  "str_quest_chat_13654015": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_13661001": "It's time for lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_13661002": "You take a break and I'll help you keep an eye on what's going on in the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13661003": "Good afternoon, Nemesis.",
  "str_quest_chat_13661004": "Uh... Regarding the situation in the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_13661005": "Do we need to be so strict? Everyone here is a friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_13661006": "Sure, we're friends, but we also need to remain vigilant at all times! This is my God-given mission!",
  "str_quest_chat_13661007": "As for you, go and have your rest!",
  "str_quest_chat_13661008": "Okay... I guess I'll do what you say.",
  "str_quest_chat_13662001": "Navigator, I've been thinking if I should establish a permanent overseer's position onboard the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13662002": "P-Permanent position?",
  "str_quest_chat_13662003": "There are many people here on the Colossus... Someone professional should be in charge.",
  "str_quest_chat_13662004": "You don't want to see it fall to chaos, do you?",
  "str_quest_chat_13662005": "Indeed...",
  "str_quest_chat_13662006": "All you need to do is to say yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_13662007": "Wa-wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_13662008": "But...",
  "str_quest_chat_13662009": "What are your concerns?",
  "str_quest_chat_13662010": "Is it the person of choice?",
  "str_quest_chat_13662011": "No, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_13662012": "I'm more than qualified for the job. The Colossus will be a place of order in no time!",
  "str_quest_chat_13662013": "Wait, Nemesis!",
  "str_quest_chat_13662014": "I feel fine leaving things as it is!",
  "str_quest_chat_13663001": "Good. The security in the mornings has been impeccable recently!",
  "str_quest_chat_13663002": "No slouching off in the afternoon, either! Be vigilant of your surroundings.",
  "str_quest_chat_13663003": "Uh... Nemesis, are you on duty?",
  "str_quest_chat_13663004": "Duty? No, I hold myself to high standards.",
  "str_quest_chat_13663005": "I must always be ready to uphold justice and righteousness...",
  "str_quest_chat_13663006": "The Illumina Federation is lucky to have a commander like you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13663007": "I hope Soroz feels the same way.",
  "str_quest_chat_13663008": "...?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13663009": "Hey, there's no need to be so serious, is there?",
  "str_quest_chat_13664001": "Never let your guard down in the afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_13664002": "There's always work to be done, and justice to serve!",
  "str_quest_chat_13664003": "How does your situation look today, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_13664004": "My situation...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13664005": "I'm bursting with energy!",
  "str_quest_chat_13664006": "Fantastic! Keep it up!",
  "str_quest_chat_13664007": "Since you seem to be doing just fine, I'll go see how everyone else is doing.",
  "str_quest_chat_13664008": "Please continue with your work.",
  "str_quest_chat_13664009": "I'm a little tired...",
  "str_quest_chat_13664010": "Oh? A person can't see the path of justice with their eyes half-closed!",
  "str_quest_chat_13664011": "Do you need me to bring you a cup of coffee, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_13664012": "Uh, I'm feeling a lot more awake now!",
  "str_quest_chat_13664013": "Is that so? In that case, please continue with your work.",
  "str_quest_chat_13664014": "Yes, Officer!",
  "str_quest_chat_13665001": "Comrade of justice!",
  "str_quest_chat_13665002": "... You mean me, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_13665003": "Of course I do, PlayerName! Not just anyone can bear the title of \"comrade of justice\" after all!",
  "str_quest_chat_13665004": "So did you need something, Nemesis?",
  "str_quest_chat_13665005": "Nothing important, no.",
  "str_quest_chat_13665006": "I just finished my lunch and felt like chatting with a friend, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat_13665007": "So you also like chatting from time to time, Nemesis?",
  "str_quest_chat_13665008": "What kind of question is that, PlayerName? Of course I do! I'm not a monster, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_13665009": "S-Sorry... So what did you want to talk about, Nemesis?",
  "str_quest_chat_13665010": "Hmm... I haven't thought about it yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_13665011": "Why don't we talk about... How best to execute justice?",
  "str_quest_chat_13665012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_13666001": "You seem awfully busy today, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13666002": "I left your lunch at your door.",
  "str_quest_chat_13666003": "Remember to make time for food, or else your body will suffer for it!",
  "str_quest_chat_13666004": "Whoa! If you hadn't reminded me, I would've completely missed lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat_13666005": "No wonder my stomach's been growling so much lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_13666006": "You're a lifesaver, Nemesis!",
  "str_quest_chat_13666007": "Haha... Hahahaha!",
  "str_quest_chat_13666008": "I-It was nothing! It's the least I can do!",
  "str_quest_chat_13666009": "Are you okay, Nemesis? You sound a little embarrassed...",

  "str_quest_chat_13701002": "I want to give it a thorough rub and polish until it sparkles.",
  "str_quest_chat_13701003": "W-why are you taking such good care of a pipe?",
  "str_quest_chat_13701004": "Why? Because it's Robyn's pipe.",
  "str_quest_chat_13701005": "The pipe will only look convincing if I always take good care of it.",

  "str_quest_chat_13701007": "Aggression? I like this comment.",
  "str_quest_chat_13701008": "Don't you think that it'll be more persuasive if the aggression is stronger?",
  "str_quest_chat_13701009": "Is it really used for persuasion?",
  "str_quest_chat_13701010": "Hey! Why all the questions when you're here to help?",
  "str_quest_chat_13701011": "You must know that I won't just ask anyone to help me maintain Robyn's pipe. You should feel especially honored.",
  "str_quest_chat_13701012": "I've never seen such condescending plead for help...",
  "str_quest_chat_13701013": "What? You've got something to say?",
  "str_quest_chat_13701014": "Take a good look at this pipe. Feel its weight in your hand and look at its sharp tip.",
  "str_quest_chat_13701015": "PlayerName, how are you feeling now?",
  "str_quest_chat_13701016": "... I'm incredibly honored by your invitation.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741001": "Hey, you the Navigator of this Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_13741002": "I heard about you in Umbraton. Nice to finally meet you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741003": "Hmm? Does news travel that fast?",
  "str_quest_chat_13741004": "We have our channels in Umbraton. It isn't hard to get hold of this kind of information.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741005": "The inside of the Colossus, on the other hand, is nothing like what I imagined.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741006": "Huh? What did you think it would be like?",
  "str_quest_chat_13741007": "Like a huge mess of pipes and weird machinery, honestly.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741008": "No sunlight, trash and scrap metal all over the floor, gross smells, and...",
  "str_quest_chat_13741009": "Alright, enough! I get it already!",
  "str_quest_chat_13741010": "I wasn't expecting there to be so many rooms, much less a rec room and a bar.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741011": "That's a load off my chest! It's way cleaner than I imagined, and the folks here seem pretty honest.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741012": "Of course. This is a Colossus after all, not a city on the ground.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741013": "Yeah, you're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741014": "Though I've heard of a few similar places...",
  "str_quest_chat_13741015": "Like Illumina's undercities!",
  "str_quest_chat_13741016": "Like a huge mess of pipes and weird machinery, honestly.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741017": "No sunlight, trash and scrap metal all over the floor, gross smells, and...",
  "str_quest_chat_13741018": "Compared to them, the slums of Umbraton are like a paradise.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741019": "Alright, enough! I get it already!",
  "str_quest_chat_13741020": "Honestly, I wasn't expecting a rec room or a bar, or all these rooms... and they're all so clean.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741021": "It's been this way for the last 17 years I've lived here. I hope you'll like it here, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741022": "Hmm... That all depends.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741023": "On what?",
  "str_quest_chat_13741024": "I'm happy as long as Robyn is around. If she isn't, though... It won't be pretty.",
  "str_quest_chat_13741025": "I... I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_13751001": "Hey, hey, hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_13751002": "Wake up!",
  "str_quest_chat_13751003": "D... Dayna? What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_13751004": "Isn't that supposed to be my line?",
  "str_quest_chat_13751005": "You're the one who sent me a request asking me to come to find you, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_13751006": "But feel free to stay in bed all day, though.",
  "str_quest_chat_13751007": "Either way, I'm charging a full day's fee for my services.",
  "str_quest_chat_13751008": "B-But I never wrote you a request, Dayna!",
  "str_quest_chat_13751009": "What? You trying to say that I, the great and powerful leader of the Spearows, misread my requests?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13751010": "Er, well... I mean... I'm sure there's got to be a misunderstanding somewhere... Right?",
  "str_quest_chat_13751011": "Hmph! Everything's clearly written in this letter right here!",
  "str_quest_chat_13751012": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_13751013": "... You know what? Forget I said anything. Have a nice morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13751014": "You totally misread it, didn't you?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13752001": "Morning! Are you awake yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_13752002": "Yep.",
  "str_quest_chat_13752003": "Good.",
  "str_quest_chat_13752004": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_13752005": "Well then, wake up already!",
  "str_quest_chat_13752006": "I need to know where you keep the cooking utensils on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_13752007": "In the Cafe, why?",
  "str_quest_chat_13752008": "What else could it be? I'm making Robyn a lovely, home-cooked breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_13752009": "Huh? You know how to cook?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13752010": "How dare you underestimate me, Boatscrapper?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13752011": "If you don't believe me...",
  "str_quest_chat_13752012": "Then I'll make you some breakfast too?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13752013": "N-No thanks! Sorry to bother you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13753001": "Morning, Boatscrapper!",
  "str_quest_chat_13753002": "Morning, Dayna.",
  "str_quest_chat_13753003": "Oh, you're awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_13753004": "Why does everyone keep saying you sleep in all the time?",
  "str_quest_chat_13753005": "I-I don't do it ALL the time...",
  "str_quest_chat_13753006": "Well, if you ever want to break that kind of bad habit, just come find me.",
  "str_quest_chat_13753007": "I guarantee that by the time I'm through with you... You'll be the earliest riser aboard the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13753008": "That sounds a little too good to be true, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_13753009": "Well... Why don't you try asking my blades instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_13753010": "Er... A-Anyway, thanks for the offer, but I don't think I need that kind of help right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_13754001": "Boatscrapper!",
  "str_quest_chat_13754002": "Feeling pretty energetic this morning, huh? What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_13754003": "I got a business proposition for you. Interested?",
  "str_quest_chat_13754004": "Uh, I think you're asking the wrong person, Dayna. I'm not really much of a business person.",
  "str_quest_chat_13754005": "Well, all I know is you'll never get ahead in life if all you do is work, work, work.",
  "str_quest_chat_13754006": "You've gotta be the boss if you really wanna be in charge of your own life!",
  "str_quest_chat_13754007": "Just look at me! After I left Istvan Gang, I managed to start a gang of my own!",
  "str_quest_chat_13754008": "I... guess you have a point?",
  "str_quest_chat_13754009": "Hah! That's the spirit, now listen up!",
  "str_quest_chat_13754010": "I need something to move my merchandise, and your Colossus is just my kind of transportation. Name your price, and I'll buy it from you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13754011": "Sorry, but no deal!",
  "str_quest_chat_13761001": "Where are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_13761002": "I'm in my room. What can I do for you, Dayna?",
  "str_quest_chat_13761003": "Have you repaired the parts I gave you last time?",
  "str_quest_chat_13761004": "...I-I'll give them to you now!",
  "str_quest_chat_13761005": "You said you'd give them to me yesterday...",
  "str_quest_chat_13761006": "I'm sorry! I've been so busy recently. I guess I just forgot...",
  "str_quest_chat_13761007": "Never mind, just find me after your lunch break.",
  "str_quest_chat_13761008": "Huh? Since when did you become so easygoing?",
  "str_quest_chat_13761009": "Me? Easygoing?",
  "str_quest_chat_13761010": "...In that case, you can give them to me now.",
  "str_quest_chat_13761011": "...Wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_13762001": "Good afternoon, boatscrapper.",
  "str_quest_chat_13762002": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_13762003": "Can you... do me a favor? It's very urgent...",
  "str_quest_chat_13762004": "Well, you're actually taking the initiative to talk to me, so it must be something really important.",
  "str_quest_chat_13762005": "Tell me, what is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13762006": "Well... I'm heading off to go work at the Guild, but I haven't eaten today.",
  "str_quest_chat_13762007": "Can you do me a favor and tell the Fireflies to put my lunch by the Colossus' exit ten minutes from now?",
  "str_quest_chat_13762008": "That way, I can just take it directly when I head off to work.",
  "str_quest_chat_13762009": "Sure, no problem!",
  "str_quest_chat_13762010": "I've just informed the Fireflies. Remember to take it!",
  "str_quest_chat_13762011": "Thanks, boatscrapper!",
  "str_quest_chat_13763001": "Boatscrapper! Water's leaking in the corridor today.",
  "str_quest_chat_13763002": "Something did seem damaged a few days ago.",
  "str_quest_chat_13763003": "I'll have the fireflies fix it as soon as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_13763004": "Can it wait a few days?",
  "str_quest_chat_13763005": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_13763006": "The sound of water dripping gives me a sense of nostalgia.",
  "str_quest_chat_13763007": "I feel like I'm back in that crappy home in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_13763008": "But, it does bother me at times.",
  "str_quest_chat_13763009": "So, I better get right on it!",
  "str_quest_chat_13764001": "Ate lunch yet, Boatscrapper?",
  "str_quest_chat_13764002": "Yes",
  "str_quest_chat_13764003": "No",
  "str_quest_chat_13764004": "What's up? Do you need my help?",
  "str_quest_chat_13764005": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_13764006": "Uh, I didn't figure that...",
  "str_quest_chat_13764007": "So, you came just to...?",
  "str_quest_chat_13764008": "No, don't.",
  "str_quest_chat_13764009": "You don't honestly think I cared about you, do you?",
  "str_quest_chat_13764010": "I saw Robyn finishing lunch, so I thought I ask you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13764011": "That's, uh, a response I'd expect from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13781001": "PlayerName, are you asleep?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13781002": "... Oh? Um... I'm about to sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_13781003": "There's no time to sleep! Get up and prepare to fight!",
  "str_quest_chat_13781004": "There are enemies?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13781005": "Didn't you tell me yesterday that you would fight with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13781006": "I was just joking!",
  "str_quest_chat_13782001": "Robyn made the dinner tonight!",
  "str_quest_chat_13782002": "I know, so what?",
  "str_quest_chat_13782003": "Don't you have any comment?",
  "str_quest_chat_13782004": "... What do you want me to say?",
  "str_quest_chat_13782005": "... You ungrateful brute! Puke everything back out!",
  "str_quest_chat_13782006": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13783001": "Boatscrapper! Any good findings today?",
  "str_quest_chat_13783002": "Nothing much. It's been a quiet day.",
  "str_quest_chat_13783003": "Are you feeling bored?",
  "str_quest_chat_13783004": "A little...",
  "str_quest_chat_13783005": "Fine, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_13783006": "How about a friendly little spar?",
  "str_quest_chat_13783007": "Ugh... I'll pass.",
  "str_quest_chat_13783008": "Just kidding! I'm always here if you ever want to talk when you're feeling bored.",
  "str_quest_chat_13783009": "Right. Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_13783010": "No problem, Boatscrapper!",
  "str_quest_chat_13784001": "Argh, the commissions are getting tougher and tougher lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_13784002": "Worked a whole day for nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_13784003": "Was it dangerous?",
  "str_quest_chat_13784004": "Were you hurt?",
  "str_quest_chat_13784005": "No, not at all...",
  "str_quest_chat_13784006": "What kind of commission was it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13784007": "To find a lost cat.",
  "str_quest_chat_13784008": "You accepted a job like that?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13784009": "A job's a job.",
  "str_quest_chat_13801001": "My friend who also pursues the truth, have you ever felt lonely in your 17 years of living in the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_13801002": "Oh? I'm not pursuing the truth... But it was quite lonely living in the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_13801003": "Although I chatted with Soroz and read the knowledge preserved inside the Colossus to imagine what the real world is like, I was still all alone.",
  "str_quest_chat_13801004": "Yes, the pursuit of truth is a lonely path. You already profoundly understand this.",
  "str_quest_chat_13801005": "Huh? I'm really not pursuing the truth...",
  "str_quest_chat_13801006": "Your imagination in the Colossus was an exploration of the outside world, which is no different from what I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_13801007": "Now that you mention it...",
  "str_quest_chat_13801008": "Even though you escaped from the Colossus, is what you see really the truth? Have you seen the true nature of White Night and the Eclipsites?",
  "str_quest_chat_13801009": "Erm... I think you're making a good point...",
  "str_quest_chat_13801010": "You're starting to have some doubts. That's great. Keep doubting as you continue to pursue the truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_13801011": "We are friends who pursue the truth. Join me on this lonely road that leads to the truth!",
  "str_quest_chat_13801012": "OK... No! How did she get me to follow her logic?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13841001": "You are the master of this Colossus, I presume?",
  "str_quest_chat_13841002": "I can feel it... I am drawing ever closer to the Truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_13841003": "Since the Truth has drawn me in this direction, I can only graciously accept.",
  "str_quest_chat_13841004": "Hello there... I'm sorry, \"the Truth\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_13841005": "Precisely. The Truth has guided us to this fateful encounter.",
  "str_quest_chat_13841006": "Then... This \"Truth\" knew when and where we would meet?",
  "str_quest_chat_13841007": "How does it know so much?",
  "str_quest_chat_13841008": "And why?",
  "str_quest_chat_13841009": "You shall obtain my power, and I shall receive illumination from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13841010": "Power? Illumination? I have no idea what you mean!",
  "str_quest_chat_13841011": "So innocent, yet so dull...",
  "str_quest_chat_13841012": "Heh... No big deal. The Truth has guided me to you, and I shall guide you like a shepherd guides his sheep.",
  "str_quest_chat_13841013": "Now, my little lost lamb... Follow your master as we search for the Truth together...",
  "str_quest_chat_13841014": "Oh... Ah, well...",
  "str_quest_chat_13842001": "I've received further illumination from the Truth today.",
  "str_quest_chat_13842002": "Its influence was much more powerful than usual... My mind is still reeling from it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13842003": "I believe... This illumination is inseparable from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13842004": "So... What was it?",
  "str_quest_chat_13842005": "Sharing it with you would only cause it to lose its meaning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13842006": "Just stand right there and all will be revealed.",
  "str_quest_chat_13842007": "Huh? Me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13842008": "Yes, my lost, little lamb. It appears enlightenment is not the Truth's only blessing today...",
  "str_quest_chat_13842009": "You appear to share many qualities with the all-powerful Lord of Truth. This familiar scent... A unique and immense power...",
  "str_quest_chat_13842010": "Next, I will seek even more answers... From you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13842011": "H-Hold on...",
  "str_quest_chat_13842012": "I thought you were searching for the Truth, Victoria...",
  "str_quest_chat_13842013": "So why the heck are you searching me?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13842014": "Heheh... Your naivety is as cute as ever.",
  "str_quest_chat_13842015": "Come, my little lamb. Whether you do so willingly or not... You cannot escape your fate!",
  "str_quest_chat_13842016": "I look forward to working with you... To finding out the truth together.",
  "str_quest_chat_13842017": "Y-yes... N-nice to meet you...",
  "str_quest_chat_13851001": "I suppose I should say good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13851002": "Ah, but I wish I were still dreaming right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_13851003": "It finally happened. I've finally woken up with zero energy.",
  "str_quest_chat_13851004": "Well, actually...",
  "str_quest_chat_13851005": "It's almost lunchtime!",
  "str_quest_chat_13852001": "Good morning, fellow worshipper of the Truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_13852002": "Huh? Are you talking about me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13852003": "Naturally I meant you, seeker of the Truth...",
  "str_quest_chat_13852004": "Seeing you awake makes me feel ready to go to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_13852005": "I really envy the way you work and sleep whenever you want...",
  "str_quest_chat_13853001": "Another morning has dawned.",
  "str_quest_chat_13853002": "Was your evening restless, Ms. Victoria?",
  "str_quest_chat_13853003": "Rest... is not a word I've been acquainted with for some time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13853004": "Do you not need rest, Ms. Victoria?",
  "str_quest_chat_13853005": "The long journey to knowledge cannot be delayed by rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_13853006": "Oh, please don't get me wrong. I do need rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_13853007": "Perhaps a century of pursuing truth will be rewarded with a century of slumber...",
  "str_quest_chat_13853008": "Followed yet again by a century of pursuing truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_13853009": "R-Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_13853010": "... You are quick to trust, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_13853011": "You're making fun of me, aren't you, Ms. Victoria?",
  "str_quest_chat_13853012": "Hehe, that's for me to know, and for you to find out.",
  "str_quest_chat_13854001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_13854002": "Did you receive further illumination from the Truth while asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_13854003": "Well, if you're asking if I had any dreams...",
  "str_quest_chat_13854004": "Then yes, I did.",
  "str_quest_chat_13854005": "But just of being chased by Eclipsites.",
  "str_quest_chat_13854006": "I woke up ever more tired than when I went to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_13854007": "Then no, I didn't.",
  "str_quest_chat_13854008": "I closed my eyes, and the next thing I knew, it was time to get up.",
  "str_quest_chat_13854009": "Heheh. Well, there's no rush.",
  "str_quest_chat_13854010": "The Truth will speak to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_13854011": "Oh... O-Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_13854012": "Although I'm not sure I want it to...",
  "str_quest_chat_13855001": "Pardon...",
  "str_quest_chat_13855002": "But would my little lamb care to join me for breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_13855003": "I spent all night preparing a warm, soupy, and delightfully-crimson meal for the two of us...",
  "str_quest_chat_13855004": "I-I don't eat that kind of stuff, Victoria!",
  "str_quest_chat_13855005": "Sorry, but I'm late for work! See you!",
  "str_quest_chat_13855006": "Hmm?",
  "str_quest_chat_13855007": "My apologies, PlayerName... I had no idea you felt so strongly about spicy hot pot.",
  "str_quest_chat_13855008": "H-Hot pot? Oh thank goodness, I thought you meant something else...",
  "str_quest_chat_13855009": "... Wait a second! Who eats spicy hot pot for breakfast?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13855010": "Having second thoughts, are we? There's still room for one more at the table...",
  "str_quest_chat_13855011": "Sorry, but I really do have a lot of work to do today...",
  "str_quest_chat_13855012": "Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_13856001": "Good morning, my little lamb.",
  "str_quest_chat_13856002": "You slept so soundly last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13856003": "Such a peaceful, untroubled face... Like that of a child.",
  "str_quest_chat_13856004": "It's no wonder you give off such a pure and fragrant aroma of the Truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_13856005": "H-Huh? You were in my room last night?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13856006": "Hahahahaha! You truly are naive, my little lamb.",
  "str_quest_chat_13856007": "Is that all it takes for you to believe me?",
  "str_quest_chat_13856008": "Although, I wouldn't mind watching over you in your sleep... All you have to do is ask.",
  "str_quest_chat_13856009": "No, thank you!",

  "str_quest_chat_13865006": "I'm weak.",
  "str_quest_chat_13865007": "True, that's what a lamb is like.",
  "str_quest_chat_13865008": "Weak. Pitiful. Helpless. Unable to fight back.",
  "str_quest_chat_13865009": "But that's not why you're like a lamb. It's your precious innocence that makes you so.",

  "str_quest_chat_13884004": "Are you looking for the Truth in the books?",

  "str_quest_chat_13886003": "Heheheh... Have you forgotten? Nothing escapes my sight...",
  "str_quest_chat_13886004": "Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately...",
  "str_quest_chat_13886005": "There is no such thing as true insomnia in the world.",
  "str_quest_chat_13886006": "If you're unable to fall asleep, it's because the Truth is calling out to you.",

  "str_quest_chat_13901002": "Afraid of fire? Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_13901003": "People subconsciously dodge when they are almost burned. That's how most people react anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_13901004": "Then... do you understand what it feels like to be burned?",
  "str_quest_chat_13901005": "I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_13901006": "I see, so it's because you have been burned before that you'll dodge?",
  "str_quest_chat_13901007": "I don't have any such experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_13901008": "So, it's natural to want to dodge even if you've never been burned before...",
  "str_quest_chat_13901009": "Unlike PlayerName, I've been scorched by flames ever since I was born.",
  "str_quest_chat_13901010": "Being burned feels painful at first, but now I'm just left with a feeling of emptiness...",
  "str_quest_chat_13901011": "But I don't feel so empty when I'm with you, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_13901012": "... Does that mean you're starting to feel pain again?",
  "str_quest_chat_13901013": "Pain is also a way to dispel the emptiness...",

  "str_quest_chat_13941007": "I can't promise you anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_13941008": "Once it begins, the flames will reduce everything to nothingness...",

  "str_quest_chat_13941010": "You're scared?",
  "str_quest_chat_13941011": "All... is nothingness... Whether it burns or not, it's all meaningless.",

  "str_quest_chat_13942011": "It's nothing... I'm used to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_13942012": "I must purge this corruption with fire... There can be no regrets...",
  "str_quest_chat_13942013": "Uriel, you're so strong.",
  "str_quest_chat_13942014": "However, if it's too much for you, please let me know right away.",
  "str_quest_chat_13942015": "Wiping out the Eclipsites is crucial, but you must know that we all care about you, Uriel...",

  "str_quest_chat_13962008": "Wait, so what's all this about?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13962009": "Greeting others... is pointless. But sometimes... it can be interesting.",

  "str_quest_chat_13963006": "Well... I'm always down... So it doesn't really change much...",
  "str_quest_chat_13963007": "I-Is that so...?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13963008": "Not really...",
  "str_quest_chat_13963009": "I think it's pretty sunny, actually. That's why I'm in such a good mood today!",
  "str_quest_chat_13963010": "I see... There's never been any sunshine in my world.",
  "str_quest_chat_13963011": "Uh... Uriel? By any chance, did you keep the curtains drawn in your room?",
  "str_quest_chat_13963012": "H-How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_13963013": "I knew it!",

  "str_quest_chat_13964003": "... Uh-huh.",
  "str_quest_chat_13964004": "It's because... I don't know what to eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_13964005": "The more I think about it, the more I can't decide... And the more I realize...",

  "str_quest_chat_13965004": "I already did.",
  "str_quest_chat_13965005": "This morning, I put out a fire, defeated some Eclipsites, and read a book... And I spaced out for a few minutes too.",
  "str_quest_chat_13965006": "I guess... That still isn't enough...",
  "str_quest_chat_13965007": "I had no idea you were so productive in the morning, Uriel!!",

  "str_quest_chat_13982004": "Just... absorbed the flames... into my body...",

  "str_quest_chat_13983001": "Good evening... The Colossus rooms... are amazing...",
  "str_quest_chat_13983002": "Huh? What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_13983003": "A closed room... nicely located in the corner...",
  "str_quest_chat_13983004": "... You've been in your room all day?",
  "str_quest_chat_13983005": "Yes... Why would I want to go out?",
  "str_quest_chat_13983006": "Uriel, I think...",
  "str_quest_chat_13983007": "Maybe it would be good for you to see the world outside your window.",
  "str_quest_chat_13983008": "Although you might think it's meaningless...",
  "str_quest_chat_13983009": "If you don't try, how can you know for sure?",
  "str_quest_chat_13983010": "I'll think about it tomorrow...",
  "str_quest_chat_13983011": "This meaningless suggestion...",
  "str_quest_chat_13983012": "Well then, good night, Uriel.",
  "str_quest_chat_13983013": "...Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13984001": "At this hour... my flames are hard to ignore...",
  "str_quest_chat_13984002": "You're still awake... Uriel?",
  "str_quest_chat_13984003": "I... can't sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_13984004": "I've been sending you so many messages... Are you annoyed?",
  "str_quest_chat_13984005": "Erm... It's a little disturbing.",
  "str_quest_chat_13984006": "I knew it...",
  "str_quest_chat_13984007": "I mean, your sleep schedule disturbs me, Uriel...",
  "str_quest_chat_13984008": "Of course not.",
  "str_quest_chat_13984009": "This happens all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_13984010": "So, here are some things you can try to get to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_13984011": "Milk, exercise, reading, relaxing...",
  "str_quest_chat_13984012": "These should help you to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_13984013": "But if you keep letting your mind ponder over negative things...",
  "str_quest_chat_13984014": "You'll upset yourself and end up tossing and turning all night.",
  "str_quest_chat_13984015": "Hmm... Nobody ever... really tried to give me... such earnest advice...",
  "str_quest_chat_13984016": "Well... I'll go try...",
  "str_quest_chat_13984017": "Good night and sweet dreams, Uriel.",
  "str_quest_chat_13985001": "My book... It's burnt.",
  "str_quest_chat_13985002": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_13985003": "I was so tired. I dozed off...",
  "str_quest_chat_13985004": "When I woke up, it was half-burned.",
  "str_quest_chat_13985005": "You're not hurt, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_13985006": "No...",
  "str_quest_chat_13985007": "That's okay, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_13985008": "I'll have to ask Vice to speak to the Illumina researchers...",
  "str_quest_chat_13985009": "Maybe they know how to stop books from being so flammable.",
  "str_quest_chat_13985010": "Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001001": "Well... Can you help me get the mail? It seems like the Courier Union is here.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001002": "Usually Dayna gets it for me, but she isn't here today.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001003": "Hmm? Why don't you go yourself? Is it because it isn't really convenient?",
  "str_quest_chat_14001004": "It's because I've once beaten the young delivery girl, Eho...",
  "str_quest_chat_14001005": "Huh? Why did you beat her?",
  "str_quest_chat_14001006": "She got too close to me too abruptly one day... and I shoved her away before I could stop myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001007": "... I tried to apologize to her afterwards, but now she just screams and runs away whenever she sees me.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001008": "That's why I'm asking for your help.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001009": "It's about time for you to change.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001010": "You react so anxiously whenever anyone approaches you...",
  "str_quest_chat_14001011": "Aren't you afraid that Dayna will dislike you?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14001012": "She won't! Stop making such lousy jokes!",
  "str_quest_chat_14001013": "I'm sorry, please forget about what I said.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001014": "Okay, I'll get the letter for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001015": "But I want to ask you something just in case.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001016": "Will you hit me if I get too close to you by mistake when I pass you the letter?",
  "str_quest_chat_14001017": "It'll be fine because I've already gotten used to you... What I mean is, we have quite a close relationship.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001018": "I'm confident that I'll be able to... control myself from hitting you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14001019": "You are? Yet you still want to hit me anyway?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14041001": "Hello, Robyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_14041002": "Do... Do you have a room for two?",
  "str_quest_chat_14041003": "It should be okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_14041004": "Well, that's great...",
  "str_quest_chat_14041005": "I... I want to stay with my sister...",
  "str_quest_chat_14041006": "Who do you want to stay with?",
  "str_quest_chat_14041007": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_14041008": "With my sister, if that's possible...",
  "str_quest_chat_14041009": "Sister? You mean...",
  "str_quest_chat_14041010": "I mean Dayna...",
  "str_quest_chat_14041011": "Oh, so you're Dayna's sister.",
  "str_quest_chat_14041012": "If you want to stay with Dayna, and she agrees to it, there should be no problem.",
  "str_quest_chat_14041013": "Alright... Can Dayna and I... sleep in the same bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_14041014": "Huh? Erm... That's for the two of you to decide... It's totally up to you...",
  "str_quest_chat_14041015": "Alright... Can Dayna and I... share the same quilt?",
  "str_quest_chat_14041016": "Huh? Erm... That's also for the two of you to decide... Do whatever you want...",
  "str_quest_chat_14041017": "Alright... Besides, can Dayna and I...",
  "str_quest_chat_14041018": "Look, you can do whatever the heck you want!",
  "str_quest_chat_14051001": "A productive day starts with a perfect morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_14051002": "Hmm... I've just finished changing.",
  "str_quest_chat_14051003": "Really? I guess you don't need Dayna's help then.",
  "str_quest_chat_14051004": "Erm... Huh? What were you planning on doing!?",
  "str_quest_chat_14052001": "I've found that watching the sunrise on the Colossus is quite the experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_14052002": "Yeah... I like it, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_14052003": "Next time, I'll bring some more people... I'll ask Dayna to come.",
  "str_quest_chat_14052004": "Sure, just don't cause too much of a commotion.",
  "str_quest_chat_14053001": "Navigator, have you seen Dayna?",
  "str_quest_chat_14053002": "Dayna? She's not with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14053003": "No. She wasn't in the room when I woke up.",
  "str_quest_chat_14053004": "That's weird. Could she have gone somewhere?",
  "str_quest_chat_14053005": "She was complaining yesterday about how easy it was for her to get lost in the maze of corridors on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_14053006": "I'll send Fireflies to find her.",
  "str_quest_chat_14053007": "Don't you worry.",
  "str_quest_chat_14053008": "Okay, I'll wait for her in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_14054001": "There are so many people on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_14054002": "There are...",
  "str_quest_chat_14054003": "I guess it's a novelty for them, so they want to come and check it out.",
  "str_quest_chat_14054004": "But it makes going out hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_14054005": "Would you like me to do anything?",
  "str_quest_chat_14054006": "Could you get me some more coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat_14054007": "If I wait until the evening, it should be quieter. Then I can go out without hurting anyone.",
  "str_quest_chat_14055001": "Good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_14055002": "Good morning, Robyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_14055003": "Oh... You're awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_14055004": "That's right! Did you need something?",
  "str_quest_chat_14055005": "I wanted to look at you while you were sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_14055006": "But since you're already awake... Forget it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14055007": "B-But why do you want to watch me sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_14055008": "I can't really talk to you unless I'm awake, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_14055009": "It's precisely because I don't wanna talk to you...",
  "str_quest_chat_14055010": "So why do you want to watch me sleep?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14055011": "I just wanted to take a peek at you... As my way of saying hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_14055012": "You really don't care much for talking, do you, Robyn...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14056001": "Ahh... Morning, already?",
  "str_quest_chat_14056002": "I just woke up... I slept for a really long time last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14056003": "That's okay. I think sleeping in from time to time is good for a person's health.",
  "str_quest_chat_14056004": "Dayna always tells me that too.",
  "str_quest_chat_14056005": "Wait... Dayna's not in the room!",
  "str_quest_chat_14056006": "D-Don't tell me she's with you?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14056007": "Don't go anywhere! I'm on my way!",
  "str_quest_chat_14056008": "Wait, you have it all wrong! Dayna isn't with me...",
  "str_quest_chat_14056009": "Oh! Dayna's back. She was just making me breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_14056010": "Er, I don't really need to know the details... But thank goodness we cleared things up before they got out of hand.",
  "str_quest_chat_14057001": "Can you guess when a pipe sounds the best?",
  "str_quest_chat_14057002": "Uh... When you twirl it around in the air?",
  "str_quest_chat_14057003": "It doesn't make any sort of sound when I do that...",
  "str_quest_chat_14057004": "Then... When you hit the ground with it?",
  "str_quest_chat_14057005": "True, that sound is nice, but it's way too sharp... too tense.",
  "str_quest_chat_14057006": "Alright, I give up...",
  "str_quest_chat_14057007": "My pipe sounds the best in the morning... Which is right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_14057008": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_14057009": "Maybe it's because everyone is getting up to wash their faces right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_14057010": "The sound of water running through the pipes... It's so pleasant.",
  "str_quest_chat_14057011": "Oh, you were talking about the Colossus' pipes all along! I thought you meant your weapon...",
  "str_quest_chat_14057012": "I'd love to take them apart and see what they look like...",
  "str_quest_chat_14057013": "Not a chance!",
  "str_quest_chat_14058001": "Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_14058002": "I noticed that your hair looks really messy right after you wake up.",
  "str_quest_chat_14058003": "R-Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_14058004": "No one's ever told me that before...",
  "str_quest_chat_14058005": "Probably because everyone likes seeing your hair all messed up.",
  "str_quest_chat_14058006": "... You guys are laughing at me behind my back, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14058007": "But I think I have a solution.",
  "str_quest_chat_14058008": "See my bangs? By heating up my pipe, I can use it to curl my hair.",
  "str_quest_chat_14058009": "Y-You use your pipe on your hair?! That sounds way too dangerous!",
  "str_quest_chat_14058010": "You know what? I think my messy hair looks kind of cool, after all... So no thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_14081001": "I think... maybe we can be closer together tomorrow...",
  "str_quest_chat_14081002": "Huh? Really?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14081003": "Yes... I-I'll do my best...",
  "str_quest_chat_14081004": "I'm a little touched...",
  "str_quest_chat_14081005": "... Dayna said that you seem to be a little near-sighted recently, so I'm worried you won't be able to see it clearly...",
  "str_quest_chat_14081006": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_14082001": "You seem to be with Dayna during the day a lot recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_14082002": "Oh, that's because there's something we need to deal with right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14082003": "... Then... I want to join you two tomorrow...",
  "str_quest_chat_14082004": "Huh? Huh?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14082005": "I can't help worrying... if she's alone with you...",
  "str_quest_chat_14082006": "What's wrong with that?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14083001": "Are you... Are you there...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14083002": "I'm here. Morning, Robyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_14083003": "I-I'm on your Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_14083004": "How are you finding it? Scary?",
  "str_quest_chat_14083005": "Boring?",
  "str_quest_chat_14083006": "N-No...",
  "str_quest_chat_14083007": "Actually, there's a place I really do like very much...",
  "str_quest_chat_14083008": "Hmm, that's odd... Where?",
  "str_quest_chat_14083009": "N-Near the water supply pipes...",
  "str_quest_chat_14083010": "...Those pipes are just like your weapons!",
  "str_quest_chat_14083011": "Looking at those heavy iron pipes... Listening to the sound of the water and wind rushing around inside...",
  "str_quest_chat_14083012": "It makes me feel so relaxed... So...",
  "str_quest_chat_14083013": "Thank you for having such a place on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_14083014": "... You're welcome.",
  "str_quest_chat_14083015": "As long as you enjoy staying here.",
  "str_quest_chat_14084001": "S-Sorry to bother you...",
  "str_quest_chat_14084002": "Are you sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_14084003": "Not yet. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_14084004": "I-I haven't returned to my room yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_14084005": "I was at the lounge... But I forgot the way back...",
  "str_quest_chat_14084006": "I-I was afraid that if I asked for directions, I'd run into someone and... accidentally hurt them...",
  "str_quest_chat_14084007": "Where are you now?",
  "str_quest_chat_14084008": "A place... with a piano... Where you can hear the wind...",
  "str_quest_chat_14084009": "Got it. I'll ask the Fireflies to take you back to your room.",
  "str_quest_chat_14084010": "Just stay where you are—don't go wandering off.",
  "str_quest_chat_14084011": "Ah... I can do that...",
  "str_quest_chat_14084012": "I hope I... won't hurt them, by accident...",
  "str_quest_chat_14084013": "Well, I'll tell them not to get too close to you...",
  "str_quest_chat_14084014": "Well then... Navigator, please have a good night's sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_14085001": "Navigator, I have something to tell you...",
  "str_quest_chat_14085002": "Yes, what is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_14085003": "I broke a Firefly... by accident...",
  "str_quest_chat_14085004": "It passed by me all of a sudden. It was so close, and I was startled, so...",
  "str_quest_chat_14085005": "Oh... don't worry.",
  "str_quest_chat_14085006": "Fireflies can be fixed.",
  "str_quest_chat_14085007": "Really? That's such a relief...",
  "str_quest_chat_14085008": "All you need to do is to leave it be.",
  "str_quest_chat_14085009": "I'll let other Fireflies bring it in for repairs.",
  "str_quest_chat_14085010": "Okay... I will stay away from them... far away...",
  "str_quest_chat_14086001": "Are you there, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_14086002": "Sure am. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_14086003": "Could you have the Fireflies bring some medicine over?",
  "str_quest_chat_14086004": "My sister's hurt and the wound needs to be treated.",
  "str_quest_chat_14086005": "Oh! Okay, I'll send them right away!",
  "str_quest_chat_14086006": "And I'll find you a doctor.",
  "str_quest_chat_14086007": "No, there's no need...",
  "str_quest_chat_14086008": "I can treat it myself. And anyway...",
  "str_quest_chat_14086009": "I'd hate to accidentally hurt a doctor.",
  "str_quest_chat_14086010": "Ah. Okay then.",
  "str_quest_chat_14086011": "And remind Dayna to be more careful next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14086012": "I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101001": "I'm here for an inspection.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_14101003": "You don't seem to be here.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101004": "Sorry, I just went out.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101005": "I know—I chose this time on purpose because I knew you wouldn't be here.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101006": "Sorry, I didn't notice that.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101007": "Huh, I guessed so.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101008": "Sorry, I'll come over to meet you right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101009": "That's okay. Don't worry about it. Just this once.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101010": "You should prepare in advance and come meet me next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101011": "But I still won't be giving you any reminders next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_14101012": "You should either always be ready or find a way to find out when I'll be coming for an inspection.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101013": "Yes, I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101014": "May I ask you a question then?",
  "str_quest_chat_14101015": "Yes you may.",
  "str_quest_chat_14101016": "Do you usually perform inspections yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_14101017": "Listen carefully, it's my duty to personally perform inspections at the places I want to go to since I'm the City Lord of Lumopolis!",
  "str_quest_chat_14101018": "I-I see. I understand now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141001": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141002": "As the City Lord of Lumopolis, I offer you my sincerest greetings.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141003": "I hope we have many opportunities to work together in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141004": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141005": "H-hello, I mean... Good day? Good night? What's the time?...",
  "str_quest_chat_14141006": "Your logic lacks even the slightest trace of organization. Don't you have anything to say, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_14141007": "However, this place is slightly different from Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141008": "Scattered and chaotic, to a degree only Umbraton can match.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141009": "Can you manage this place on your own?",
  "str_quest_chat_14141010": "(This is too much. I don't even want to think about it.)",
  "str_quest_chat_14141011": "Well, if you must know...",
  "str_quest_chat_14141012": "I can do it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141013": "My answer is yes. I can do it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141014": "Lumopolis has its order, as does Soroz. That doesn't mean it's worse than Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141015": "That word \"manage\" sounds so serious.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141016": "This is where my friends and I live. We trust each other and we take care of each other... We don't need any kind of management.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141017": "Ah, a typical youngster's answer. Well, you young people live in your world. You have your responsibilities and destiny.",
  "str_quest_chat_14141018": "Let me see what you've got.",
  "str_quest_chat_14151001": "Let's be grateful for the order, as we wouldn't have this morning without it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14151002": "Good morning, Lord Schwartz!",
  "str_quest_chat_14151003": "Did you understand the meaning of my words just now?",
  "str_quest_chat_14151004": "I did!",
  "str_quest_chat_14151005": "Thanks to you and the rule of law, everyone in Lumopolis can enjoy a quiet, peaceful morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_14151006": "Heheheh. Tell me, my young friend, when did you become so adept at flattery?",
  "str_quest_chat_14151007": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_14151008": "But if I had to guess. It must have something to do with Lumopolis' rules, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_14151009": "Heheheh... I applaud you for acknowledging your own lack of knowledge, my young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_14151010": "The order in which I speak does not simply apply to Lumopolis but all of nature as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_14151011": "For without natural order in the world, the sun would never rise, and nature would cease to exist.",
  "str_quest_chat_14151012": "Try not to disappoint me next time I ask you this.",
  "str_quest_chat_14151013": "Y-Yes, sir!",
  "str_quest_chat_14152001": "Tell me, Master of the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_14152002": "Which books did you happen to read this morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_14152003": "R-Read...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14152004": "Hmm? Could it be that you have just woken up?",
  "str_quest_chat_14152005": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_14152006": "No!",
  "str_quest_chat_14152007": "I-I was busy doing something else!",
  "str_quest_chat_14152008": "But I'll go do some reading right away!",
  "str_quest_chat_14152009": "It's far too late now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14152010": "By this hour, Carleen would have finished her morning studies and swordsmanship training before preparing to go to work.",
  "str_quest_chat_14152011": "Oh? I didn't know you knew her schedule so well, my lord?",
  "str_quest_chat_14152012": "Of course I do. As her father, it's my duty to know.",
  "str_quest_chat_14152013": "... Then I'll do my best to follow her example!",
  "str_quest_chat_14152014": "Hmm... Then I only hope that she doesn't set the bar too high for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14152015": "Huh...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14153001": "Master of the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_14153002": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_14153003": "Good morning, my lord!",
  "str_quest_chat_14153004": "There's no need to be so tense. Tell me, have you taken your breakfast yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_14153005": "Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_14153006": "A person's mind will only go to waste without a proper breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_14153007": "I'll leave you to reflect on my words. Good day.",
  "str_quest_chat_14153008": "Thank you for the reminder, my lord... I'll try to have a healthy breakfast every day from now on!",
  "str_quest_chat_14154001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_14154002": "Lord Schwartz... G-Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_14154003": "Have you gotten accustomed to living aboard the Colossus? If there's anything you're not satisfied with, just let me know and I'll change it for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_14154004": "The air freshener used in my room is... a bit overpowering.",
  "str_quest_chat_14154005": "Oh, that is the scent that Carleen used to use all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14154006": "I thought the nobles of Lumopolis would like that kind of fragrance?",
  "str_quest_chat_14154007": "Carleen, you say...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14154008": "I'm sorry, my lord! I'll go change it right away!",
  "str_quest_chat_14154009": "No need. It feels a lot more tolerable now that I've gotten used to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14154010": "... Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_14161001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_14161002": "Hey. So... What can I do for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14161003": "I didn't mean to disturb your lunch break. This is the order of things on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_14161004": "But when I was meditating on the bridge, I noticed you pass by my side.",
  "str_quest_chat_14161005": "M-My posture was alright, wasn't it!?",
  "str_quest_chat_14161006": "Yes, but what I have to say is not regarding your posture.",
  "str_quest_chat_14161007": "Your collar wasn't straight, Caelestite. And there are some stains on the back of your clothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_14161008": "Such attire is not suitable for even sleepwear, let alone for a leader to parade around in.",
  "str_quest_chat_14161009": "...I-I'll tell the Fireflies to sort it out, right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_14161010": "Thank you for reminding me... Your Excellency.",
  "str_quest_chat_14161011": "Hmm.",
  "str_quest_chat_14162001": "Those charged with maintaining order, should first maintain order within themselves.",
  "str_quest_chat_14162002": "What do you usually do at lunch time?",
  "str_quest_chat_14162003": "Sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_14162004": "Well, this is really a way of leading by example.",
  "str_quest_chat_14162005": "I... read and learn.",
  "str_quest_chat_14162006": "I also believe diligence is key... One should never stop learning, no matter what.",
  "str_quest_chat_14162007": "You look rather young, but it seems you possess a degree of conscientiousness befitting a leader.",
  "str_quest_chat_14162008": "Well, good day to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14162009": "G-Good day, Your Excellency!",
  "str_quest_chat_14163001": "Good afternoon. Have you had lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_14163002": "Good afternoon! I've just finished eating.",
  "str_quest_chat_14163003": "Hmm. Always remember to eat on time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14163004": "...Thank you? I always eat on time...",
  "str_quest_chat_14163005": "Maybe that's because you haven't encountered anything that might affect your appetite.",
  "str_quest_chat_14163006": "What you must always keep in mind is that if your emotions affect your physiology, they're not worth the trouble.",
  "str_quest_chat_14163007": "Now, I need you to repeat what I just said.",
  "str_quest_chat_14163008": "Always remember...",
  "str_quest_chat_14163009": "...to eat on time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14163010": "Thank you for reminding me... I will remember.",
  "str_quest_chat_14164001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_14164002": "Good afternoon, Your Excellency!",
  "str_quest_chat_14164003": "It's a simple greeting. No need to be so nervous.",
  "str_quest_chat_14164004": "Right! I was just prepared to take a break, Your Excellency!",
  "str_quest_chat_14164005": "You don't have to be so formal.",
  "str_quest_chat_14164006": "Understood, Your Excellency!",
  "str_quest_chat_14164007": "... See you later, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_14164008": "Have a great afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_14164009": "Noted, Your Excellency! You, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_14181001": "You must still be awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_14181002": "Ah, Your Excellency...",
  "str_quest_chat_14181003": "I'm still awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_14181004": "Hmm... It confuses me.",
  "str_quest_chat_14181005": "Looking up at the night sky from the Colossus seems no different from gazing up from within Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_14181006": "We often only see the problems before us without realizing that the ways in which we protect ourselves are actually one and the same.",
  "str_quest_chat_14181007": "Uh... How profound...",
  "str_quest_chat_14181008": "Indeed, I shouldn't have said such a thing to someone your age.",
  "str_quest_chat_14181009": "... I rarely make such slips of the tongue. Perhaps that's what makes you special, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_14181010": "Sleep early. Farewell.",
  "str_quest_chat_14181011": "Oh... Erm... Good night, Your Excellency.",
  "str_quest_chat_14182001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_14182002": "Good evening, Your Excellency!",
  "str_quest_chat_14182003": "You must have spoken with some members of the Lumopolis nobility before, correct?",
  "str_quest_chat_14182004": "Ah... Yes! I've met several nobles.",
  "str_quest_chat_14182005": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_14182006": "Carleen is doing well...",
  "str_quest_chat_14182007": "Is that what you want to ask?",
  "str_quest_chat_14182008": "...Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_14182009": "I was just thinking...",
  "str_quest_chat_14182010": "May I ask... what's bothering you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14182011": "The conflict between organizational structure and order... is actually very subtle.",
  "str_quest_chat_14182012": "Erm... For example?",
  "str_quest_chat_14182013": "How can the two extreme opposing concepts of classes and equality realized within the same city-state?",
  "str_quest_chat_14182014": "I'm afraid that I don't have your answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_14182015": "Good night. I wish you a sound sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_14182016": "Good night, Your Excellency.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183002": "Good evening, City Lord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183003": "You're still up.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183004": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_14183005": "I'm going to read some more.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183006": "Diligence is a valuable trait for a commander.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183007": "But you need to keep a balance between work and rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183008": "I've had some things on my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183009": "Thoughtful deliberation is how a commander conducts himself.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183010": "But one must not overthink.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183011": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_14183012": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183013": "Have a good night's sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_14183014": "Good night, City Lord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14184001": "Looking down from the Colossus, everything on the ground is small as a star in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_14184002": "Good evening, City Lord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14184003": "You get similar views to this in Lumopolis, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_14184004": "It is nice, but never be ignorant of reality simply because you're up high.",
  "str_quest_chat_14184005": "Things that seem small and far away might be hundreds, even thousands of times larger than us.",
  "str_quest_chat_14184006": "Just because they're distant doesn't mean you should overlook them.",
  "str_quest_chat_14184007": "I-Indeed...",
  "str_quest_chat_14184008": "You should turn in early. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14184009": "Good night, City Lord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14201001": "PlayerName, PlayerName, are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_14201002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_14201003": "Something bad has happened!",
  "str_quest_chat_14201004": "I probably already know what you want to inform me about.",
  "str_quest_chat_14201005": "What is it that you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_14201006": "Let's chat later because I have something urgent to attend to now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14201007": "What happened? Tell me so I can help you!",
  "str_quest_chat_14201008": "If your thing is more urgent, we'll deal with your thing first before dealing with mine!",
  "str_quest_chat_14201009": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_14201010": "There seems to have been an explosion at the back end of the Colossus, and I need to check on it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14201011": "Oh, I see!",
  "str_quest_chat_14201012": "Did you see my explosives barrel?",
  "str_quest_chat_14201013": "My explosives barrel fell over suddenly when I was chatting with someone.",
  "str_quest_chat_14201014": "Wait, the Colossus was flying up into the sky just now...",
  "str_quest_chat_14201015": "Yes, the floors of the corridor slanted and my barrel rolled out!",
  "str_quest_chat_14201016": "... Doesn't that mean...!!",
  "str_quest_chat_14201017": "Bang! It exploded!",
  "str_quest_chat_14201018": "Joanie Boom! It was you!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_14241001": "Counting down to detonation... Ten, nine, eight...",
  "str_quest_chat_14241002": "Detonation? What detonation?",
  "str_quest_chat_14241003": "The bomb I just put in your pocket. It will explode once I count down to zero.",
  "str_quest_chat_14241004": "Seven, six...",
  "str_quest_chat_14241005": "Wait a minute... Where's the bomb? Why can't I find it?",
  "str_quest_chat_14241006": "Look in your right pocket!",
  "str_quest_chat_14241007": "This is the most powerful bomb there is! Kaboom! It even has the power to blow your mind! It'll positively liven up your repetitive and monotonous little life!",
  "str_quest_chat_14241008": "Five, four, three—you don't have much time left!",
  "str_quest_chat_14241009": "Ah! I can feel it! Strange... What's this square-shaped thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_14241010": "Two! One! Zero! Kaboom!! Can you feel the anticipation? Are you ready for the grand explosion?",
  "str_quest_chat_14241011": "It... didn't explode?",
  "str_quest_chat_14241012": "Hmm, of course. You just have to take the wrapper off and put the bomb in your mouth.",
  "str_quest_chat_14241013": "It has a sweet and sour taste that explodes in your mouth like fireworks! It's so powerful, odds are it'll bring you to tears!",
  "str_quest_chat_14241014": "Huh? So when you said \"bomb\", you just meant pop rocks?",
  "str_quest_chat_14241015": "Of course, that's what I meant!",
  "str_quest_chat_14251001": "Boom! Come on out!",
  "str_quest_chat_14251002": "Morning, Joanie Boom...",
  "str_quest_chat_14251003": "Have you had breakfast yet? Did you eat? Did you eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_14251004": "Yes, I'm eating.",
  "str_quest_chat_14251005": "But breakfast tastes a little strange today...",
  "str_quest_chat_14251006": "Ahaha! That's because I fried up your breakfast with special edible explosives!",
  "str_quest_chat_14251007": "Hmm... Looks like I'll need to crank up the heat next time! Modify the formula!",
  "str_quest_chat_14251008": "...That explains the weird taste!",
  "str_quest_chat_14252001": "Bang! Time to get up, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_14252002": "I heard you!",
  "str_quest_chat_14252003": "You didn't have to yell...",
  "str_quest_chat_14252004": "No way!",
  "str_quest_chat_14252005": "Gotta be loud to make sure you wake up!",
  "str_quest_chat_14253001": "Did you see the fireworks by your bedside table?",
  "str_quest_chat_14253002": "Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_14253003": "... Wait, what fireworks?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14253004": "Oh, just a handy little invention of mine... A special alarm designed just for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_14253005": "If you don't wake up in time... It shoots out a bunch of pretty fireworks!",
  "str_quest_chat_14253006": "I'm already out of bed. So that means I'm safe, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_14253007": "Huh? Drat... I must've forgotten to set the alarm before I left...",
  "str_quest_chat_14253008": "But that's okay! I can also control it remotely, so you don't miss out on the fun! Here we go!",
  "str_quest_chat_14253009": "W-Wait, don't do it!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_14254001": "Boom! Come on out!",
  "str_quest_chat_14254002": "Hi, Joanie. Need something?",
  "str_quest_chat_14254003": "Nah, I just wanted to ask... Did you like the candy I sent you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14254004": "So you're the one who left that candy on my doorstep! Let's see...",
  "str_quest_chat_14254005": "Mmm, not bad!",
  "str_quest_chat_14254006": "I made it myself! But that's no ordinary candy, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_14254007": "Wait... You made it yourself? I thought you only knew how to make bombs?",
  "str_quest_chat_14254008": "That's right, and this candy's no exception! Once it starts to melt in your mouth, it goes off with a huge bang!",
  "str_quest_chat_14254009": "Wh-What?! Urgh... Just in time too...",
  "str_quest_chat_14254010": "Yep, it explodes with the delicious, chocolatey goodness that it's filled with!",
  "str_quest_chat_14254011": "Oh...",
  "str_quest_chat_14255001": "You up yet?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14255002": "Good morning! Did you need something?",
  "str_quest_chat_14255003": "Do you have something to say about me? Huh?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14255004": "Not really... Unless it has something to do with your reckless use of explosives on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_14255005": "Is that so? Then riddle me this... Why did you tell the Fireflies to wash all of my clothes?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14255006": "Uh, is there anything wrong with that?",
  "str_quest_chat_14255007": "I can't even walk straight in these clothes! They're way too clean!",
  "str_quest_chat_14255008": "I oughta blow the Colossus to smithereens for this!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_14255009": "D-Don't, please! I, uh... What if I ask the Fireflies to make your clothes dirty again?",
  "str_quest_chat_14255010": "Alright, but you better make it quick!",
  "str_quest_chat_14256001": "Ugh, what a pain! I just woke up too...",
  "str_quest_chat_14256002": "What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_14256003": "Do you guys HAVE to separate your trash here?",
  "str_quest_chat_14256004": "Well, I've been trying to be more mindful of waste lately... So I thought we could recycle some stuff to reuse in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_14256005": "I could go give you a hand if you're having trouble figuring it out.",
  "str_quest_chat_14256006": "Huh? Wait a second... Does that mean you recycle metal too?",
  "str_quest_chat_14256007": "That's right! I hear you can make good money by selling it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14256008": "Hahahaha! You're something else, you know that?",
  "str_quest_chat_14256009": "You just made it a hundred times easier for me to gather materials for my bombs!",
  "str_quest_chat_14256010": "J-Just don't get carried away! Hello? Joanie?",
  "str_quest_chat_14261001": "Bang! Boom! Kaboom! Sizzle!",
  "str_quest_chat_14261002": "?? What are those?",
  "str_quest_chat_14261003": "Which of the above explosion sounds do you like best?",
  "str_quest_chat_14261004": "... If I had to choose, it would be kaboom.",
  "str_quest_chat_14261005": "Then I'll give that to you later to boost your spirits!",
  "str_quest_chat_14261006": "???!",
  "str_quest_chat_14262001": "Yo, PlayerName, whatcha up to?",
  "str_quest_chat_14262002": "I was about to take a nap...",
  "str_quest_chat_14262003": "Why would you waste such a lovely noon sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_14262004": "Wanna have some fun?",
  "str_quest_chat_14262005": "I won't fall for your shenanigans this time!",
  "str_quest_chat_14262006": "First tell me what you're planning to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_14262007": "Tch, boring.",
  "str_quest_chat_14262008": "Don't worry. There's no danger involved this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14262009": "Boss and I are gonna go hunt a few sandworms so we can get some fresh meat for grilling.",
  "str_quest_chat_14262010": "Wanna join us?",
  "str_quest_chat_14262011": "There's a lot of danger involved in that!",
  "str_quest_chat_14262012": "Are you questioning the strength of the Rediesel Wrench?",
  "str_quest_chat_14262013": "Hunting sandworms is our forte.",
  "str_quest_chat_14262014": "What do you want me to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_14262015": "Nothing!",
  "str_quest_chat_14262016": "Just sit in your front-row seat and be entertained!",
  "str_quest_chat_14262017": "For real...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14262018": "Absolutely!",
  "str_quest_chat_14262019": "Well... fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_14262020": "I've got nothing else to do, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_14262021": "Perfect! It's settled!",
  "str_quest_chat_14262022": "I'll go tell Boss that you agreed to be the bait.",
  "str_quest_chat_14262023": "See you in a bit!",
  "str_quest_chat_14262024": "Come again?",
  "str_quest_chat_14262025": "Did you say bait?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14262026": "I changed my mind. I'm out!",
  "str_quest_chat_14263001": "G...g-good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_14263002": "That's a prodigy's greeting!",
  "str_quest_chat_14263003": "Good day.",
  "str_quest_chat_14263004": "G... g-goodbye!",
  "str_quest_chat_14263005": "That's a prodigy's farewell!",
  "str_quest_chat_14263006": "...Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_14264001": "Break time!",
  "str_quest_chat_14264002": "Now I can work on my new type of bomb!",
  "str_quest_chat_14264003": "Isn't that just more work?",
  "str_quest_chat_14264004": "Don't you get tired?",
  "str_quest_chat_14264005": "If you ask me, bomb-making is very relaxing!",
  "str_quest_chat_14301001": "PlayerName, Sir, I need to ask for a leave!",
  "str_quest_chat_14301002": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_14301003": "That's great! Can I take two hours off then?",
  "str_quest_chat_14301004": "Actually, you don't need to take any leave. Just go off if there's something you want to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_14301005": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_14301006": "Although I'm currently on duty at the Colossus, I need to take two hours' leave from you!",
  "str_quest_chat_14301007": "It's not work, so you can do whatever you want. You don't need my permission.",
  "str_quest_chat_14301008": "B-but I can't have such a casual attitude toward you or the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_14301009": "Fine, I approve your leave! Can I ask what you'll be doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_14301010": "Lady Gabriel wants me to handle some matters.",
  "str_quest_chat_14301011": "I'm a little curious. What type of matters?",
  "str_quest_chat_14301012": "I need to visit the chief judge in Lumopolis, then patrol Lumopolis before going to Umbraton to gather intelligence.",
  "str_quest_chat_14301013": "After that, I will take some snacks to Lady Gabriel and write a report on the things I did recently. Then...",
  "str_quest_chat_14301014": "Hold on, I don't think you'll be able to do all that within two hours.",
  "str_quest_chat_14301015": "It's alright! I'll do my best!",
  "str_quest_chat_14301016": "Don't force yourself—just take as much time as you need.",
  "str_quest_chat_14301017": "No! I've already set myself a goal!",
  "str_quest_chat_14301018": "Well, the time I allocated to talk to you is up. I'm off now!",
  "str_quest_chat_14301019": "Sigh, just go.",
  "str_quest_chat_14341001": "I'm Amy, the banner bearer! The responsibility of those who hold the flag aloft... is to lead everyone on to victory!",
  "str_quest_chat_14341002": "What do you mean by \"lead everyone on to victory\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_14341003": "It means... I think it means leading everyone to follow their heart. Like, becoming a pillar of strength who guides your soul...",
  "str_quest_chat_14341004": "A pillar that remains with you through the stress and strife, forging ahead into the future!",
  "str_quest_chat_14341005": "But at the moment, it seems like just a dream...",
  "str_quest_chat_14341006": "I'm short, I don't have any energy at all, and I also... I also stutter.",
  "str_quest_chat_14341007": "Can I become a true banner bearer?",
  "str_quest_chat_14341008": "If you truly \"follow your heart\" as you said, maybe you can do it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14341009": "You're right. Failure is a vital part of growing up. Even if you encounter a setback, you're sure to gain something along the way.",
  "str_quest_chat_14341010": "You can't think twice when chasing your dreams—the most important thing is to take that first step!",
  "str_quest_chat_14341011": "I @$!$!%#%!W#",
  "str_quest_chat_14341012": "Huh? What's wrong, Amy? Are you okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_14341013": "I f-fell... I didn't expect to fall on my first step... and, and hit my head...",
  "str_quest_chat_14341014": "It seems \"forging ahead\" and becoming a real banner bearer might be trickier than it sounds.",
  "str_quest_chat_14341015": "Right... I have a long, long way to go.",
  "str_quest_chat_14351001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_14351002": "Aah...",
  "str_quest_chat_14351003": "It looks like you aren't awake yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_14351004": "I'm just still a little drowsy...",
  "str_quest_chat_14351005": "I see, then you probably won't mind that I broke your door by mistake when I knocked on it just now...",
  "str_quest_chat_14351006": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14352001": "Another brand-new day, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_14352002": "Good morning, Amy.",
  "str_quest_chat_14352003": "G'morning! I did my very best to get a good night's rest last night, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_14352004": "You shouldn't have to try so hard to rest, but sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_14352005": "No matter what I'm doing, I have to give it my absolute best!",
  "str_quest_chat_14352006": "Ah! That's right! I should do my morning exercises by now!",
  "str_quest_chat_14352007": "Thanks for the reminder, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_14352008": "Uh... Sure? Enjoy your workout!",
  "str_quest_chat_14353001": "Good morning, Navigator PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_14353002": "Morning sets the tone for the day. I wish you a wonderful morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_14353003": "Ah... Good morning, Amy...",
  "str_quest_chat_14353004": "I just dreamed about something awful...",
  "str_quest_chat_14353005": "What did you dream about? Do you need help with anything?",
  "str_quest_chat_14353006": "I dreamed that I couldn't afford to repair the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_14353007": "I dreamed that someone blew up the corridors of the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_14353008": "Navigator PlayerName, you must not be fully awake yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_14353009": "Come and work out with me. That'll wake you up!",
  "str_quest_chat_14353010": "No no no, I'm all good.",
  "str_quest_chat_14353011": "I still want to get some more sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_14354001": "Oh hi... good morning, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_14354002": "Amy?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14354003": "Is that really you, Amy?",
  "str_quest_chat_14354004": "How come you sound so tired?",
  "str_quest_chat_14354005": "Well, I wanted to come off as more imposing, so I practiced till late night in front of a mirror yesterday...",
  "str_quest_chat_14354006": "I went all out and made some progress, but alas...",
  "str_quest_chat_14354007": "Alas...",
  "str_quest_chat_14354008": "Amy?",
  "str_quest_chat_14354009": "She probably fell asleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_14354010": "Rest is important. Try not to work too hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_14355001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_14355002": "Good morning!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_14355003": "Woah! Why so loud?",
  "str_quest_chat_14355004": "Sorry, did I scare you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14355005": "The Illuminans told me that a loud greeting creates an imposing impression",
  "str_quest_chat_14355006": "There's no need to shout.",
  "str_quest_chat_14355007": "Sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat_14355008": "You already appear imposing.",
  "str_quest_chat_14355009": "R-Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_14355010": "Maybe I'll try a different approach.",
  "str_quest_chat_14355011": "Oh, being imposing is such hard work.",
  "str_quest_chat_14361001": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_14361002": "Good afternoon, Amy.",
  "str_quest_chat_14361003": "Wh-What kind of work do you usually do around noon, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_14361004": "Noon? I usually take a break around that time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14361005": "Huh? I had no idea someone as incredible as you also took afternoon breaks!",
  "str_quest_chat_14361006": "Er... W-Well, yeah!",
  "str_quest_chat_14361007": "Can't get much work done in the afternoon if you're too tired to focus!",
  "str_quest_chat_14361008": "I-I see! That makes perfect sense, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_14361009": "I'll d-do my best to learn from your example, and put it into practice!",
  "str_quest_chat_14361010": "Uh... You could just take a break, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_14362001": "G-Good afternoon, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_14362002": "Was today's lunch to your liking?",
  "str_quest_chat_14362003": "Yeah, today's lunch tasted pretty good!",
  "str_quest_chat_14362004": "But I should be the one asking you, Amy. After all, you're my guest here on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_14362005": "Oh, thank goodness! PlayerName thinks my lunch tasted good!",
  "str_quest_chat_14362006": "Oh? You made lunch today, Amy?",
  "str_quest_chat_14362007": "Y-Yes, I did!",
  "str_quest_chat_14362008": "I-I decided that as long as I'm on the Colossus, I should learn every single job there is to do around here!",
  "str_quest_chat_14362009": "Making lunch today was just the first step in my journey!",
  "str_quest_chat_14362010": "I still have lots to learn, like cleaning the corridors, performing routine maintenance, or...",
  "str_quest_chat_14362011": "You really don't have to!",
  "str_quest_chat_14363001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_14363002": "Is there anything you wish for me to do today?",
  "str_quest_chat_14363003": "Oh, hey, Amy.",
  "str_quest_chat_14363004": "Nothing at the moment, no. Why don't you go take a break instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_14363005": "But it's already been one hour, thirty-two minutes, and forty-eight seconds since I've done something!",
  "str_quest_chat_14363006": "At this rate, I won't be worthy of carrying this banner!",
  "str_quest_chat_14363007": "Then I'll never be worthy of knighthood!",
  "str_quest_chat_14363008": "Uh... Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_14363009": "Then could you do me a favor and count sheep in your bed? Preferably a hundred of them... With your eyes closed, if that's okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_14363010": "A very specific request... But I accept! I promise to see my mission through to its end!",
  "str_quest_chat_14364001": "What are you up to, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_14364002": "Just having lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_14364003": "I see! And how do you eat your lunch, exactly?",
  "str_quest_chat_14364004": "Uh... With a fork and knife, like everyone else?",
  "str_quest_chat_14364005": "Just getting ready for a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_14364006": "I see! And how do you take your naps, exactly?",
  "str_quest_chat_14364007": "Uh... By lying in bed, like everyone else?",
  "str_quest_chat_14364008": "What's with these questions anyway, Amy?",
  "str_quest_chat_14364009": "I-I've come to the realization that there's more to life than just work...",
  "str_quest_chat_14364010": "So I'm trying my best to learn how to make small talk with other people!",
  "str_quest_chat_14364011": "You really don't have to try so hard to make small talk, Amy. The most important thing is to relax and act naturally.",
  "str_quest_chat_14364012": "I see, I see! Thank you, PlayerName! I'll do my best to keep learning!",
  "str_quest_chat_14365001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_14365002": "I left your lunch in the doorway of your room! Please remember to eat it!",
  "str_quest_chat_14365003": "Thanks, Amy, but you can just let the Fireflies handle this sort of thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_14365004": "Th-That won't do at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_14365005": "You won't be able to see how hard I've been working if I do that...!",
  "str_quest_chat_14365006": "Uh... Is that why you've been working so hard, Amy? Just so that I would notice?",
  "str_quest_chat_14365007": "N-Not at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_14365008": "I, uh... It's... It's so that I can improve as a person!",
  "str_quest_chat_14365009": "Right! Thank you for making that perfectly clear for me, PlayerName! I understand now!",
  "str_quest_chat_14365010": "It seems I still have a long ways to go...",
  "str_quest_chat_14365011": "Starting right now, I'll work even harder than ever before!!",
  "str_quest_chat_14365012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_14401001": "May the truth bless you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_14401002": "Words like \"favor\" and \"trouble\" are always difficult to utter.",
  "str_quest_chat_14401003": "But at this moment, only you can help me.",
  "str_quest_chat_14401004": "No, I don't want to join the True Order...",
  "str_quest_chat_14401005": "So the cold wind of refusal blows...",
  "str_quest_chat_14401006": "If you one day change your mind, the doors of the True Order will still be open to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14401007": "But today I want to ask you something else.",
  "str_quest_chat_14401008": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_14401009": "It's a relatively small matter, but it's driving me insane.",
  "str_quest_chat_14401010": "Perhaps you want to know the whole story, and you're willing to help me?",
  "str_quest_chat_14401011": "If you have time, please come and see me in the Colossus <color=#FFB400>lounge</color>.",
  "str_quest_chat_14401012": "My sincere friend—my trusted confidant! I will be waiting for you there.",
  "str_quest_chat_14401999": "Does Faust have a problem he needs help with? How curious... I should go to the lounge and find him.",
  "str_quest_chat_14441001": "Hello... Are you interested in knowing the truth?",
  "str_quest_chat_14441002": "I'm not interested.",
  "str_quest_chat_14441003": "You're so matter-of-fact.",
  "str_quest_chat_14441004": "The path to the truth needs nothing more than momentum and decisive action, so...",
  "str_quest_chat_14441005": "I, Faust, a member of the True Order, must take on the mission of spreading the truth with unfaltering conviction.",
  "str_quest_chat_14441006": "The truth? You mean...",
  "str_quest_chat_14441007": "Yes, it's as you've guessed. I, Faust, am a member of the True Order, and spreading the truth is my lifelong mission.",
  "str_quest_chat_14441008": "Living in such a huge Colossus, you must have unique views on the truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_14441009": "There's no harm in us discussing them.",
  "str_quest_chat_14441010": "Does my view on truth have anything to do with the fact that I live on Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_14441011": "Of course. You can fly high into the skies and look down on this continent.",
  "str_quest_chat_14441012": "You're certain to have a unique perspective of this continent.",
  "str_quest_chat_14441013": "If such a perspective doesn't bring you closer to the truth...",
  "str_quest_chat_14441014": "Hmm... Maybe, maybe not...",
  "str_quest_chat_14441015": "Well then, let me bring you the gospel of truth!",
  "str_quest_chat_14441016": "Come now, where's your room? It's time for us to have a serious talk.",
  "str_quest_chat_14441017": "Erm, well... Wait a moment...",
  "str_quest_chat_14441018": "Don't come in! The door's closed... No, I mean it's locked!",
  "str_quest_chat_14481001": "Good evening, my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_14481002": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_14481003": "At this moment, all is silent... I can hear the resonance of countless thoughts resounding through the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_14481004": "So, what do you see in your mind at this moment?",
  "str_quest_chat_14481005": "Let me think...",
  "str_quest_chat_14481006": "Don't think... feel...",
  "str_quest_chat_14481007": "Pillow... Blanket... Sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_14481008": "Ah... Such a sincere and touching answer...",
  "str_quest_chat_14481009": "Maybe honesty is the truth in your heart?",
  "str_quest_chat_14481010": "It is a thought worth pondering.",
  "str_quest_chat_14482001": "Dear Navigator, the night has come.",
  "str_quest_chat_14482002": "How was your day?",
  "str_quest_chat_14482003": "I believe you must now possess a new understanding of the truth we discussed earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_14482004": "Right! But I think I forgot it...",
  "str_quest_chat_14482005": "I believe I can hear the sound of speculation stirring in your brain...",
  "str_quest_chat_14482006": "I really don't have a deep understanding of truth...",
  "str_quest_chat_14482007": "In that case, I will further dissect this doctrine with you in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_14483001": "Nighttime is the dreamscape of Truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_14483002": "It is when the truth of the world slowly emerges from behind the dark curtain of the sky...",
  "str_quest_chat_14483003": "All beings look up to the sky and trace the trails of stars, trying to decipher Truth from them.",
  "str_quest_chat_14483004": "But little do they know that Truth is already upon us.",
  "str_quest_chat_14483005": "That sounds creepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_14483006": "Oh, don't worry.",
  "str_quest_chat_14483007": "The door to Truth is always open to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14483008": "Would you like to join us?",
  "str_quest_chat_14484001": "The stars really light up the night sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_14484002": "Like now, the view from the window's simply breathtaking.",
  "str_quest_chat_14484003": "Still awake, Mr. Faust?",
  "str_quest_chat_14484004": "Well, it's a beautiful night. It'll be a waste not to let inspiration run its course.",
  "str_quest_chat_14484005": "... My apologies, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_14484006": "I know I initiated this conversation, but I don't really feel like talking to anyone right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14484007": "I bid you a good night's rest. On a night like this, I have need to gather my thoughts.",
  "str_quest_chat_14484008": "Alright... Goodnight then.",
  "str_quest_chat_14485001": "Good evening, dear PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_14485002": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_14485003": "As expected, smiling all day is one way to tire out one's face.",
  "str_quest_chat_14485004": "Did you attend an event today, Mr. Faust?",
  "str_quest_chat_14485005": "Ah, yes indeed. Perhaps you've heard of my fan club before?",
  "str_quest_chat_14485006": "Uh, yes, I know you have a fan club.",
  "str_quest_chat_14485007": "In order to live up to their expectations, it's imperative that I smile in exactly the same manner to each member.",
  "str_quest_chat_14485008": "It's the least I can do to repay their affections.",
  "str_quest_chat_14485009": "I see. You're a really considerate person, Mr. Faust!",
  "str_quest_chat_14485010": "Really? I can't quite say I agree with such praise...",
  "str_quest_chat_14485011": "But rest early, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_14485012": "Night then.",
  "str_quest_chat_14486001": "The moon and stars shine bright in the clear night sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_14486002": "The starry sky also veils fragments of the Truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_14486003": "Good evening, Faust.",
  "str_quest_chat_14486004": "Are you stargazing again?",
  "str_quest_chat_14486005": "Yes. My quest for the Truth is never-ending.",
  "str_quest_chat_14486006": "All right, take it easy. I'm going to bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_14487001": "Good evening, my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_14487002": "I wanted to ask for your help in a certain matter.",
  "str_quest_chat_14487003": "... You're not going to ask me to join the True Order, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14487004": "Hahaha! I would never dream of forcing anyone to do so.",
  "str_quest_chat_14487005": "Besides, when the whispers of the Truth finally reach your ears... You'll join us on your own accord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14487006": "Then what exactly do you need my help with?",
  "str_quest_chat_14487007": "My fan club... That group of lovely ladies has been searching for me high and low.",
  "str_quest_chat_14487008": "However, I've already preached the Truth to them for seven days and seven nights.",
  "str_quest_chat_14487009": "Though my spirit yearns to continue elucidating the Truth to their eager minds, my body is... A bit fatigued.",
  "str_quest_chat_14487010": "Should they decide to come looking for me here on the Colossus, will you help conceal my presence from them?",
  "str_quest_chat_14487011": "You were at it for a week straight?! You should really get some rest... Don't worry, you'll be safe here.",
  "str_quest_chat_14487012": "Thank you, my friend. The Truth will never forget your kind deeds.",
  "str_quest_chat_14488001": "My dear friend...",
  "str_quest_chat_14488002": "Having trouble sleeping again, I see?",
  "str_quest_chat_14488003": "Yeah, you could say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_14488004": "Wait, how did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_14488005": "Aside from consuming the painful memories of others... My White Suitcase is also fond of snacking on the stress caused by poor sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_14488006": "It picked up the scent of your insomnia and began to grow restless.",
  "str_quest_chat_14488007": "My White Suitcase could do with a nice meal... Would you mind if I left it in your room for the night?",
  "str_quest_chat_14488008": "Not even in your dreams!",
  "str_quest_chat_14488009": "Heheheh. If you feel so strongly against it, then I have nothing more to say.",
  "str_quest_chat_14488010": "I'm gonna sleep now. Sorry, but your White Suitcase will just have to find something else to eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_14488011": "Is that so? But the aroma of your insomnia appears to be intensifying... Why is that, I wonder?",
  "str_quest_chat_14489001": "Good evening, my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_14489002": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_14489003": "Tell me, PlayerName... Have you noticed a certain similarity between us?",
  "str_quest_chat_14489004": "We're both tall?",
  "str_quest_chat_14489005": "I had no idea you had such a fanciful opinion of yourself, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_14489006": "We're both handsome?",
  "str_quest_chat_14489007": "Complimenting me on my looks as well, PlayerName? You sound just like my fans...",
  "str_quest_chat_14489008": "What I mean, however, is that I was also weak and sickly as a child.",
  "str_quest_chat_14489009": "As a result, I spent years of my childhood locked up in my home.",
  "str_quest_chat_14489010": "I don't think our past experiences are all that alike, Faust.",
  "str_quest_chat_14489011": "You have a point. While you may have been weak, you were never particularly sickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_14489012": "Hey...!",
  "str_quest_chat_14490001": "Good evening, dear PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_14490002": "Thanks to your kind hospitality, I was finally able to taste the Colossus' late-night cuisine.",
  "str_quest_chat_14490003": "I had no idea the Caelestites were also fond of spicy food.",
  "str_quest_chat_14490004": "Spicy food? Oh, you must be talking about the roasted sandworms!",

  "str_quest_chat_14490009": "What I ate just now was nothing more than honey-glazed chicken, sprinkled with chili powder... Right?!",

  "str_quest_chat_14501999": "Pact is rather stubborn. The last time she asked me to go to the rec room, I didn't go. She stayed there for ten days... I should go to the lounge as quickly as I can so that doesn't happen again.",

  "str_quest_chat_14502015": "Right away?",
  "str_quest_chat_14502016": "But I haven't even decided whether to do it or not. This whole schedule thing... it's not that necessary...",

  "str_quest_chat_14541015": "I'm not mad!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_14541016": "Forget it, this isn't worth the hassle. So... what is the name of the Colossus, then?",
  "str_quest_chat_14541017": "The Colossus is called Soroz... Hold on, Uh... Why are you even asking me this!?",
  "str_quest_chat_14551001": "Good morning, Navigator. I didn't expect to see you up so early.",
  "str_quest_chat_14551002": "I always get up early...",
  "str_quest_chat_14551003": "Is that so? Well, I hope I didn't disturb your sleep.",

  "str_quest_chat_14552005": "No, I was talking about my breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_14552006": "Although the yolks on these two fried eggs could have been done a little better...",
  "str_quest_chat_14552007": "... Then why did you need me to reply in three seconds?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14553001": "Are you up?",
  "str_quest_chat_14553002": "Y-Yes, I am!",
  "str_quest_chat_14553003": "That was too slow.",

  "str_quest_chat_14553005": "I'll let you slide this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14553006": "But respond as fast as you can next time.",

  "str_quest_chat_14554003": "Your response took 3.5 seconds.",
  "str_quest_chat_14554004": "But after taking into account the time it takes for terminals to deliver messages... It appears your response time is acceptable.",
  "str_quest_chat_14554005": "Why do I have to reply so quickly?",
  "str_quest_chat_14554006": "If it takes longer than three seconds to reply, then I have no choice but to continue waiting for your response.",
  "str_quest_chat_14554007": "You could always do something else in the meantime unless it's an emergency. I don't expect you to reply to me right away either.",
  "str_quest_chat_14554008": "But what if I had an emergency today?",
  "str_quest_chat_14554009": "... Okay, so what's your emergency?",
  "str_quest_chat_14554010": "... Good morning",
  "str_quest_chat_14554011": "That's all you wanted to tell me?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14555001": "A friendly reminder.",
  "str_quest_chat_14555002": "If you don't get out of bed... You'll be late.",

  "str_quest_chat_14555004": "Wait a minute... What do you mean by that? It's still early!",
  "str_quest_chat_14555005": "Good. You finally woke up at the same time as the previous day.",
  "str_quest_chat_14555006": "I feel much more relieved now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14555007": "I'll make sure to wake you up at the same time tomorrow as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_14555008": "B-But... The only reason I woke up so early yesterday was because I had a nightmare!",
  "str_quest_chat_14556001": "Ah!",
  "str_quest_chat_14556002": "Pact! What's the matter?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14556003": "My breakfast... Why are there carrots in it today?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14556004": "... If you don't like them, you can just set them aside.",
  "str_quest_chat_14556005": "Don't worry, I won't force you to eat them or anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_14556006": "But the rest of the food has already been contaminated by the carrots being on the same plate!",
  "str_quest_chat_14556007": "C-Contaminated?",
  "str_quest_chat_14556008": "Never mind. I've lost my appetite.",
  "str_quest_chat_14556009": "Here. Since you love carrots so much, you can have my breakfast too.",
  "str_quest_chat_14556010": "Just give me your lunch later today, and we'll call it even.",
  "str_quest_chat_14556011": "B-But, today's lunch has carrots in it too...",
  "str_quest_chat_14556012": "... Farewell.",
  "str_quest_chat_14557001": "Are you awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_14557002": "Good morning! I just got up.",
  "str_quest_chat_14557003": "I have nothing to report.",
  "str_quest_chat_14557004": "However... I noticed that the Bridge was a mess, so I cleaned it up a little.",
  "str_quest_chat_14557005": "Thanks, Pact!",
  "str_quest_chat_14557006": "Don't get the wrong idea. I didn't do it to help you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14557007": "I just didn't want to set foot in such a disorganized place.",
  "str_quest_chat_14557008": "Still, I didn't expect to find your tattered notebooks in there...",
  "str_quest_chat_14557009": "So I took the liberty of buying you a set of brand-new notebooks to replace them.",
  "str_quest_chat_14557010": "Oh, you didn't have to do that. I just use those for studying, so it's okay if they get a little beat up.",
  "str_quest_chat_14557011": "I see... Then it looks like I shouldn't have thrown them out either. What a shame...",
  "str_quest_chat_14557012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_14581001": "It's time for bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_14581002": "Is it that late already? I didn't even notice the time...",
  "str_quest_chat_14581003": "I recommend you go to sleep now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14581004": "All right, all right... I know.",
  "str_quest_chat_14582001": "Navigator, would you like to try a little midnight snack I found for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14582002": "\"Found\"? Don't you mean \"made\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_14582003": "I can't make this kind of thing so all I can do is to search and find.",
  "str_quest_chat_14582004": "No way... Who knows what you'll try to make me eat!",
  "str_quest_chat_14583001": "Just checking to see if you're already asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_14583002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_14583003": "Why not?",
  "str_quest_chat_14583004": "I'm still doing some reading.",
  "str_quest_chat_14583005": "Yes, I am.",
  "str_quest_chat_14583006": "... How could you be replying to me if you're already asleep? Liar!",
  "str_quest_chat_14583007": "I was just joking! I'm still doing some reading.",
  "str_quest_chat_14583008": "Reading? So you like to read before bed, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_14583009": "In that case, I wish you pleasant dreams... I guess. Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_14583010": "... Good night, Pact.",
  "str_quest_chat_14584001": "I gave your Fireflies some solid training today.",
  "str_quest_chat_14584002": "Huh? Was there something wrong with them?",
  "str_quest_chat_14584003": "Are you kidding? They were flying all over the place! They couldn't move in a straight line!",
  "str_quest_chat_14584004": "I spent all afternoon and all night teaching them to fly in a nice, single-file line... But they haven't figured it out yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_14584005": "Fools, the lot of them... Say, don't you think you should take some responsibility over their education?",
  "str_quest_chat_14584006": "But... The Fireflies have never been super-intelligent beings, or anything...",
  "str_quest_chat_14584007": "They've never been capable of flying in a single-file line...",
  "str_quest_chat_14584008": "Or even understanding all of a person's commands, for that matter.",
  "str_quest_chat_14584009": "Then you should be figuring out how to fix that, don't you think?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14584010": "I'm completely exhausted. I need my rest!",
  "str_quest_chat_14584011": "M-Maybe... We can discuss this later, then...",
  "str_quest_chat_14585001": "Navigator, why are you still up?",
  "str_quest_chat_14585002": "Huh?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14585003": "How did you know, Pact?",
  "str_quest_chat_14585004": "I guessed.",
  "str_quest_chat_14585005": "I was just testing you, but surprisingly, you came clean so easily.",
  "str_quest_chat_14585006": "I can't believe you caught me...",
  "str_quest_chat_14585007": "This isn't good.",
  "str_quest_chat_14585008": "I urge you to go to sleep now in accordance with the schedule.",
  "str_quest_chat_14585009": "Don't stay up late!",
  "str_quest_chat_14585010": "Okay, okay... Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_14586001": "Oh, what!?",
  "str_quest_chat_14586002": "What's made you so angry?",
  "str_quest_chat_14586003": "Your sleeping patterns are in complete chaos!",
  "str_quest_chat_14586004": "Sometimes you sleep very early. Sometimes you sleep too late.",
  "str_quest_chat_14586005": "Can't you sleep at the same time every day?",
  "str_quest_chat_14586006": "Er... No?",
  "str_quest_chat_14586007": "I mean, every day is different.",
  "str_quest_chat_14586008": "I have to react to circumstances.",
  "str_quest_chat_14587001": "Have you got a room I can lock something up in? One with walls that won't break easily?",
  "str_quest_chat_14587002": "I need an immediate response!",
  "str_quest_chat_14587003": "I-I'm coming! What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_14587004": "I'm going to lock my ring up!",
  "str_quest_chat_14587005": "I have to stop it from following me everywhere. It's stopping me from sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_14587006": "But... surely it doesn't make any noise?",
  "str_quest_chat_14587007": "How does it stop you from sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_14587008": "Because every time I roll over, I land on its thorns!",
  "str_quest_chat_14601001": "PlayerName, bring me the Firefly that needs repairing. I'm in the lounge right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14601002": "Alright! Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_14601003": "It's nothing. I mean, after all, we've been through, I can't help but take things like this seriously.",
  "str_quest_chat_14601004": "Are you sure it's no trouble?",
  "str_quest_chat_14601005": "Repairs like this are not a big deal.",
  "str_quest_chat_14601006": "The problem here should be those who didn't use their head and consider things were broken.",
  "str_quest_chat_14601007": "Ah... When a machine breaks down, most people just bang on it with their fists.",
  "str_quest_chat_14601008": "If only they could do the same to their own broken brains.",
  "str_quest_chat_14601009": "The lounge, remember it's the <color=#FFB400>lounge</color>.",
  "str_quest_chat_14601999": "Odi promised to help me repair the broken Firefly in the lounge. She said her schedule is full, and there may be many people there...",
  "str_quest_chat_14602001": "Hey! Wanna see something cool?",
  "str_quest_chat_14602002": "Something cool? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_14602003": "It's just the complete Illumina member roster, that's all! It even has the names of some secret squads outsiders have never heard of! How could anyone not find such a thing interesting!",
  "str_quest_chat_14602004": "What? How did you get your hands on that?",
  "str_quest_chat_14602005": "I hacked into their system, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_14602006": "You've been hacking again? I heard Vice say that you were hacking only just last week...",
  "str_quest_chat_14602007": "Last week was last week, this week is this week, so what's the problem? That's the thing about hacking—it's always new!",
  "str_quest_chat_14602008": "So, do you want to see it or not?",
  "str_quest_chat_14602009": "Isn't it wrong to poke your nose into other people's secrets...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14602010": "What are you afraid of? Think they'll come looking for us? You have a Colossus! How can they get us when we're soaring through the clouds?",
  "str_quest_chat_14602011": "Wait a minute... How did you get your hands on that?",
  "str_quest_chat_14602012": "I hacked into their system, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_14602013": "Why have you been hacking again? How many times did you go hacking last week?",
  "str_quest_chat_14602014": "Don't worry about it! That's the thing about hacking—it's always new!",
  "str_quest_chat_14602015": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_14602016": "We can't do that...",
  "str_quest_chat_14602017": "We can't? Oh, I see—the Colossus' power system isn't strong enough.",
  "str_quest_chat_14602018": "No worries! I'll help you to break through the security restrictions! One second and we'll be flying high!",
  "str_quest_chat_14602019": "The Illumina Federation won't be able to lay a hand on us!",
  "str_quest_chat_14602020": "That's clearly not what I meant!",
  "str_quest_chat_14641001": "Hey, you have a pretty good communications system here!",
  "str_quest_chat_14641002": "Instant messaging—it's so easy to send and receive messages!",
  "str_quest_chat_14641003": "Single line evaluations—it's super easy to use!",
  "str_quest_chat_14641004": "I'm glad you like it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14641005": "If I'm not mistaken, you're the only one who's praised Soroz's communication system.",
  "str_quest_chat_14641006": "Of course! I can see how good it is at a single glance, not like the rest of those muscle heads!",
  "str_quest_chat_14641007": "After all, I tried for half a day and didn't manage to hack it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14641008": "What!? You tried to hack into Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_14641009": "Of course! A huge thing like this... How could I resist!?",
  "str_quest_chat_14641010": "Actually, I'm about to make it into the bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_14641011": "But there are several areas I can't hack into...",
  "str_quest_chat_14641012": "Can you give me a hint? Just a little hint should be enough for me to get in!",
  "str_quest_chat_14641013": "Why would I give you a hint!?",
  "str_quest_chat_14651001": "Have you seen a red firefly?",
  "str_quest_chat_14651002": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat_14651003": "This is odd...",
  "str_quest_chat_14651004": "It seems to have just passed by the door...",
  "str_quest_chat_14651005": "Wait. A red firefly?",
  "str_quest_chat_14651006": "Why is it red?",
  "str_quest_chat_14651007": "Because I modified it, so I marked it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14651008": "But it's been acting strange since I modified it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14651009": "Fix it back to normal, please!",
  "str_quest_chat_14651010": "Oh, fine. Why are you so upset?",
  "str_quest_chat_14652001": "Say, who makes breakfast every morning on Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_14652002": "No one in particular.",
  "str_quest_chat_14652003": "Probably those who love to cook.",
  "str_quest_chat_14652004": "Usually it's just whoever wants to cook, and they make enough for everybody.",
  "str_quest_chat_14652005": "If no one cooks, there's always the nutrient solution from the life support device.",
  "str_quest_chat_14652006": "There's a life support device on Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_14652007": "Interesting! I should hack the system and see how it operates.",
  "str_quest_chat_14652008": "No hacking Soroz!",
  "str_quest_chat_14661001": "PlayerName, are you busy right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_14661002": "I've just had my lunch... What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_14661003": "Come assist me with something. I need your help!",
  "str_quest_chat_14661004": "You've come up against another obstacle, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_14661005": "It seems you know me too well... Well, I'll say no more.",
  "str_quest_chat_14661006": "What a hard life...",
  "str_quest_chat_14662001": "Geez, I haven't seen you in such a long time. No one bothers to come and see me!",
  "str_quest_chat_14662002": "What a drag... Hey, why don't you take a nap first?",
  "str_quest_chat_14662003": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_14662004": "Oh, no. I seem to be getting something from the ellipsis.",
  "str_quest_chat_14662005": "Goodbye, PlayerName, and goodbye lunch break.",
  "str_quest_chat_14662006": "Don't give up, Odi!",
  "str_quest_chat_14663001": "A lot of people hit you up this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_14663002": "You got back to some of them real quick, but for some, you didn't even check their messages.",
  "str_quest_chat_14663003": "Hehe... That's interesting!",
  "str_quest_chat_14663004": "Hey, are you accessing my account?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14663005": "Why don't you make a guess?",
  "str_quest_chat_14663006": "What about my privacy?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14663007": "Fooled you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14663008": "I'd never spend my precious time on something that trivial!",
  "str_quest_chat_14663009": "Well, that's alright then...",
  "str_quest_chat_14663010": "Well, that doesn't exactly make me feel better.",
  "str_quest_chat_14664001": "You've been in and out of your room all day. What are you up to?",
  "str_quest_chat_14664002": "I'm tidying up and clearing out some old things I don't need.",
  "str_quest_chat_14664003": "Where have you hacked into now?",
  "str_quest_chat_14664004": "I just hacked a Firefly and sent it to your door.",
  "str_quest_chat_14664005": "How did you see that?",
  "str_quest_chat_14664006": "Well, I just borrowed one of your Fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat_14664007": "Reset it right now! And stop spying on me!",
  "str_quest_chat_14664008": "Tch.",
  "str_quest_chat_14681001": "Hey! Wake up!",
  "str_quest_chat_14681002": "Good evening, Odi. I haven't gone to bed yet, you know...",
  "str_quest_chat_14681003": "Perfect. I lost a pair of glasses today!",
  "str_quest_chat_14681004": "Do you need me to help you search for them?",
  "str_quest_chat_14681005": "Nope! I've already found them a while ago.",
  "str_quest_chat_14681006": "I just came to tell you, I installed a brand-new component on your Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_14681007": "Crap... Why do I have a bad feeling about this...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14681008": "Seeing as how often I lose my glasses, I've installed devices in every corner of the Colossus to help me search for them.",
  "str_quest_chat_14681009": "They can tell me exactly where my glasses are the moment I lose them!",
  "str_quest_chat_14681010": "The only problem is... They make a lot of noise when they're in standby mode...",
  "str_quest_chat_14681011": "But the important thing is, I'll never have to worry about losing my glasses ever again!",
  "str_quest_chat_14681012": "Anyways, I just wanted to let you know about it. I'm off to bed now. Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_14681013": "Wait a second! You better take all of them down tomorrow, you hear me?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14682001": "Heeheehee... It's gotten late.",
  "str_quest_chat_14682002": "Good evening, Odi. You seem in pretty high spirits tonight?",
  "str_quest_chat_14682003": "That's right! I managed to improve the comms in the Colossus today!",
  "str_quest_chat_14682004": "... The comms system? You mean Soroz's communications system?",
  "str_quest_chat_14682005": "I noticed that you woke up late this morning, and you were muttering something to yourself about wishing you could eat breakfast in bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_14682006": "And when you were in the training room, not only were you slacking off, you were also complaining about Vice's regiment being too harsh!",
  "str_quest_chat_14682007": "Hahahahaha! I have to say... I've really outdone myself this time! I'm a genius!",
  "str_quest_chat_14682008": "No, no, no, you don't call that an improvement!",
  "str_quest_chat_14682009": "That's just outright spying! Get rid of it this instant!",
  "str_quest_chat_14682010": "If you don't do it, I'll have the Fireflies undo your improvements instead!",
  "str_quest_chat_14682011": "Makes no difference to me. At least I got to see a different, lazier side of you today!",
  "str_quest_chat_14682012": "Heeheehee... I'm going to bed now!",
  "str_quest_chat_14683001": "I've restored the hacked Firefly.",
  "str_quest_chat_14683002": "Thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_14683003": "Actually, no! You hacked it in the first place.",
  "str_quest_chat_14683004": "Don't be so petty.",
  "str_quest_chat_14683005": "Oh, and I did a bit of maintenance at the same time. I replaced some old components.",
  "str_quest_chat_14683006": "Okay, thanks for that, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat_14683007": "Don't mention it. But maybe you could lend me some Fireflies to play with sometime...",
  "str_quest_chat_14683008": "No!",
  "str_quest_chat_14684001": "You're in bed already? I don't believe you!",
  "str_quest_chat_14684002": "You don't believe that it's my bedtime...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14684003": "Heck no! Do you have any idea how early it is?",
  "str_quest_chat_14684004": "Besides, how could you go to bed before putting such a beautiful Terminal System to good use?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14684005": "But it really is my bedtime...",
  "str_quest_chat_14684006": "Fine, fine... Get some sleep then.",
  "str_quest_chat_14684007": "I'll just entertain myself by hacking into your terminal and reading through your chat logs!",
  "str_quest_chat_14684008": "Hey! Don't even think about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_14684009": "Too late! Now let's see... Huh? Why can't I hack into your terminal?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14684010": "Hmm... Soroz must've put multiple encryptions on your terminal to prevent others from accessing it... Even I can't hack it!",
  "str_quest_chat_14684011": "Ha, that serves you right! Good night, Odi!",
  "str_quest_chat_14685001": "Hello?",
  "str_quest_chat_14685002": "Ugh, I'm so unbelievably bored right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_14685003": "You get bored too, Odi?",
  "str_quest_chat_14685004": "I've been blacklisted on every comms channel out there... No one feels like dealing with me in their chat rooms anymore!",
  "str_quest_chat_14685005": "I guess this must be what it feels like to be invincible.",
  "str_quest_chat_14685006": "So lonely... So very, very lonely...",
  "str_quest_chat_14685007": "And yet, I couldn't be prouder of myself!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_14685008": "I really don't need to know any of this, Odi...",
  "str_quest_chat_14686001": "Hehehehehehe.... Oh, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_14686002": "Huh? Oh, good evening, Odi! Still working?",
  "str_quest_chat_14686003": "Hmph! But of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_14686004": "How could I ever pass up the latest gossip on the comms channels?",
  "str_quest_chat_14686005": "... You hacked into someone's terminal again, didn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14686006": "Huh? I-I have no idea what you're talking about! Hahaha...",
  "str_quest_chat_14686007": "Anyway, I think I picked up on something juicy! Someone's saying, \"I really like PlayerName...\"",
  "str_quest_chat_14686008": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_14686009": "Hang on, there's more! \"I really like PlayerName's... headband?\" What kind of tasteless moron...?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14687001": "So sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_14687002": "Huh? Now that's a rare sight.",
  "str_quest_chat_14687003": "I don't think I've ever heard you say you're sleepy, Odi!",
  "str_quest_chat_14687004": "Don't remind me...",
  "str_quest_chat_14687005": "Those Rediesel Wrench idiots went out racing again today.",
  "str_quest_chat_14687006": "But they ended up crashing almost all of their cars! Even their weapons and communicators were completely smashed!",
  "str_quest_chat_14687007": "I've been working around the clock to fix everything they broke!",
  "str_quest_chat_14687008": "That sounds awful...",
  "str_quest_chat_14687009": "Ah, to hell with it. I'm going to bed! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_14687010": "Good night, Odi.",
  "str_quest_chat_14701001": "Navigator, I have a gift for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14701002": "Is it a birthday present?",
  "str_quest_chat_14701003": "A special day requires a special gift—",
  "str_quest_chat_14701004": "But today I have something different.",
  "str_quest_chat_14701005": "What kind of gift is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_14701006": "A treasure that not only embodies the present but also guides us into the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_14701007": "In my opinion, there is no gift more appropriate.",
  "str_quest_chat_14701008": "Kleken introduced you to me, and my people have caused you a lot of trouble on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_14701009": "I've prepared a little gesture for you. Please come to the <color=#FFB400>bar</color> when you have time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14701999": "A gift? I'm excited, but a little confused. I should go to the bar and see the Shadowlord in person to find out what kind of gift it is.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702001": "Is there anything, in particular, you want to do right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_14702002": "Huh? Wait... Why are you asking me this out of the blue?",
  "str_quest_chat_14702003": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702004": "Well... I wish to have a big meal right now! I hear the steak in Lumopolis is delicious...",
  "str_quest_chat_14702005": "Good answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702006": "A good meal... That's all many Umbraton residents dream of.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702007": "But they can't even dream of asking for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702008": "Right now... All I want is some decent sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702009": "I went to bed so late last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702010": "Sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_14702011": "To sleep safe and sound... That's all many Umbraton residents dream of.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702012": "Ah, sorry... I seem to have said something I perhaps should not have said.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702013": "There's no need to apologize.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702014": "The troubles of Umbraton did not unfold in a day; naturally, they cannot be solved in a day.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702015": "But I won't stop until that day comes.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702016": "Understood.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702017": "It seems like... I will do anything to avenge my people.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702018": "That's it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702019": "Such a colossal goal can't be achieved overnight, but as long as you don't lose your way and move forward with determination...",
  "str_quest_chat_14702020": "The day of vindication shall arrive.",
  "str_quest_chat_14702021": "Ah... That's quite inspiring.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741001": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741002": "I've heard about you. The fabled Caelestite, commanding the Colossus of an ancient civilization, and at such a young age... and with such a promising future.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741003": "The shadows will be watching you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741004": "Shadows... You mean Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat_14741005": "Take it as you will.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741006": "Just remember that the shadows will always be there. There is no need to cast them off, and you wouldn't be able to, even if you tried.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741007": "Alright... Although I don't quite understand, I'll take it in the best way I can.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741008": "Anyway, welcome to Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741009": "Oh... He's called Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_14741010": "It not only protects you but also guides you in your fate. Interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741011": "Huh? It seems you know more than you're letting on...",
  "str_quest_chat_14741012": "It's too early to say... but at this time, the shadows know everything they should.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741013": "I'm also looking forward to seeing how you will navigate the road ahead.",
  "str_quest_chat_14741014": "Don't let me down.",
  "str_quest_chat_14751001": "May the shadows watch over you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_14751002": "Morning, Shadowlord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14751003": "Your attitude is commendable this morning, young man.",
  "str_quest_chat_14751004": "You knew to begin your day before the shadows appear...",
  "str_quest_chat_14751005": "Well, I had a bad dream last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14751006": "I dreamed that I was about to get swallowed up by a great, big shadow...",
  "str_quest_chat_14751007": "When the sun rises, the shadows will disperse.",
  "str_quest_chat_14751008": "But they are never truly gone. Always be cautious of the surrounding shadows.",
  "str_quest_chat_14751009": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_14751010": "Hahahaha! May the rest of your morning be pleasant!",
  "str_quest_chat_14752001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_14752002": "Morning, Shadowlord!",
  "str_quest_chat_14752003": "You're up so early!",
  "str_quest_chat_14752004": "At this hour?",
  "str_quest_chat_14752005": "I almost never see you at this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14752006": "It's because I stayed up till dawn dealing with some issues.",
  "str_quest_chat_14752007": "That must be rough on you!",
  "str_quest_chat_14752008": "I don't think so.",
  "str_quest_chat_14752009": "Corax and Cuscuta, now they've had it rough.",
  "str_quest_chat_14752010": "Hold on, what would they be doing at night...",
  "str_quest_chat_14752011": "It's exactly what you're thinking.",
  "str_quest_chat_14752012": "Just a few simple operations, removing certain small tumors from Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_14752013": "Err...",
  "str_quest_chat_14752014": "Did I scare you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14752015": "So, you've been waiting for news?",
  "str_quest_chat_14752016": "Yes. Don't freak out, this is just how things are in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_14752017": "Regardless, I hope you have a great day.",
  "str_quest_chat_14753001": "Morning, young one.",
  "str_quest_chat_14753002": "Please, let me snooze for a bit longer...",
  "str_quest_chat_14753003": "Wait, what?! G-Good morning, Shadowlord!",
  "str_quest_chat_14753004": "Sorry, I was half awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_14753005": "No harm done.",
  "str_quest_chat_14753006": "It's you youngsters' privilege to enjoy your sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_14753007": "... Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_14754001": "Remember to act early.",
  "str_quest_chat_14754002": "Good morning, Shadowlord!",
  "str_quest_chat_14754003": "Up so early, my young friend?",
  "str_quest_chat_14754004": "Yeah, I woke up a while ago.",
  "str_quest_chat_14754005": "Excellent. Your self-discipline is quite admirable.",
  "str_quest_chat_14754006": "Actually, I just got up.",
  "str_quest_chat_14754007": "Hmm... Well, you're at that age, after all. A little more sleep is perfectly natural.",
  "str_quest_chat_14754008": "However, it appears no one's preparing breakfast this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_14754009": "Ah! I-I completely forgot...!",
  "str_quest_chat_14754010": "Don't worry, this is hardly a cause for such concern.",
  "str_quest_chat_14754011": "Still, you would do well to remember my words: Act early, and do your best to prepare for anything in your future.",
  "str_quest_chat_14754012": "Okay!",
  "str_quest_chat_14755001": "Responsible one.",
  "str_quest_chat_14755002": "What's your plan for today?",
  "str_quest_chat_14755003": "Oh! Good morning, Shadowlord!",
  "str_quest_chat_14755004": "I'm going to do some reading in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_14755005": "Books are a wonderful way to understand the ways of this world.",
  "str_quest_chat_14755006": "But experiencing the world through your eyes is equally important. Remember to make time to see it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14755007": "I'm going to take on a few jobs to make money!",
  "str_quest_chat_14755008": "Although money is not a reliable measurement of success...",
  "str_quest_chat_14755009": "The skills you hone in pursuit of money will always serve you well.",
  "str_quest_chat_14755010": "Try to keep this in mind as you carry out your work.",
  "str_quest_chat_14755011": "Understood! Thank you, Shadowlord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14756001": "Good morning, young one.",
  "str_quest_chat_14756002": "Have you been practicing chess lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_14756003": "I've been pretty busy, so not really...",
  "str_quest_chat_14756004": "Keeping busy is admirable, but never overlook the value of adequate rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_14756005": "Chess is perfect for not only training your analytical skills, but also for helping you attend to your other matters.",
  "str_quest_chat_14756006": "Of course I have, but I'm still not very good...",
  "str_quest_chat_14756007": "The first step is always the hardest to take.",
  "str_quest_chat_14756008": "Once you progress to a certain point, you'll realize that chess is much more simple than it seems.",
  "str_quest_chat_14756009": "Best of luck.",
  "str_quest_chat_14756010": "I eagerly await our next match.",
  "str_quest_chat_14757001": "I must say, my young friend... Your wine selection has been quite impressive lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_14757002": "Good morning, Shadowlord!",
  "str_quest_chat_14757003": "Actually, I asked Lady Sheol to help me choose those bottles just for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14757004": "Oh? You're as thoughtful as ever, young man.",
  "str_quest_chat_14757005": "Only because you've taught me so much, my lord!",
  "str_quest_chat_14757006": "Only the finest wines will do when you're here!",
  "str_quest_chat_14757007": "Interesting... I don't recall teaching you such advanced forms of flattery?",
  "str_quest_chat_14757008": "Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat_14757009": "I'll gladly accept the wine, and will compensate you accordingly for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14757010": "Think of it as a sale, if you would.",
  "str_quest_chat_14781001": "Good evening, young man.",
  "str_quest_chat_14781002": "Your Colossus is in good order. I am quite fond of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14781003": "Th-Thanks, but I'm sure it's still unworthy of the Shadowlord's praise.",
  "str_quest_chat_14781004": "I see... There are, indeed, no palatable snacks to be had here.",
  "str_quest_chat_14781005": "Sorry if my accommodations aren't to your liking...",
  "str_quest_chat_14781006": "There's no need to be so formal, my young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_14781007": "I happen to have brought you some of my personal favorite, in the event this would happen.",
  "str_quest_chat_14781008": "You can see them there behind you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14781009": "Thank you, but how could I bear to take such expensive delicacies from you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14781010": "Please accept it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14781011": "Although... It is very late, you should get some rest, keep yourself healthy.",
  "str_quest_chat_14781012": "Th-Thank you, Shadowlord! It's just, I get the feeling...",
  "str_quest_chat_14781013": "Your gifts won't last long enough for me to enjoy them tomorrow...",
  "str_quest_chat_14782001": "Are you asleep, my young friend?",
  "str_quest_chat_14782002": "Not yet, Shadowlord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14782003": "What has been occupying your time lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_14782004": "I've been studying this whole time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14782005": "I've been working this whole time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14782006": "Hmm. It must be quite tiring.",
  "str_quest_chat_14782007": "If only other young people were more practical like you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14782008": "I see a lot of my younger self when I look at you, to be honest...",
  "str_quest_chat_14782009": "What were you like before, Shadowlord?",
  "str_quest_chat_14782010": "It's a bit late to discuss such a lengthy topic.",
  "str_quest_chat_14782011": "We can talk about it some other day. Rest well, my young friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_14783001": "I hear your chess skills have improved lately, young man.",
  "str_quest_chat_14783002": "Uh... I... maybe?",
  "str_quest_chat_14783003": "Oh? Does this mean I misheard?",
  "str_quest_chat_14783004": "I-I mean, I still practice once in a while...",
  "str_quest_chat_14783005": "Hmm... Do you know what the worst thing a person could do in chess is?",
  "str_quest_chat_14783006": "Not... practicing enough?",
  "str_quest_chat_14783007": "No. The worst thing a person could do in chess... is cheating.",
  "str_quest_chat_14783008": "To cheat another person, is to cheat one's self.",
  "str_quest_chat_14783009": "The improvement of one's chess skills is, indeed, quite important...",
  "str_quest_chat_14783010": "But nothing is more important than integrity.",
  "str_quest_chat_14783011": "I-I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_14783012": "Ah, but it's getting late... Go to bed soon, my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_14784001": "Have you gone to bed yet, young man?",
  "str_quest_chat_14784002": "I was just getting ready to do that, Shadowlord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14784003": "You indulged in quite the late-night snacking just now, didn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14784004": "Ahaha... Sorry, I've just been burning so much energy during training lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_14784005": "I must not have realized that my appetite grew to match the extra strain on my body.",
  "str_quest_chat_14784006": "Hmm. A healthy body and appetite is indeed a clear sign of youth.",
  "str_quest_chat_14784007": "Should I... take that as a compliment?",
  "str_quest_chat_14784008": "Of course. Once you reach the point in your life where eating and sleeping don't come quite so easily...",
  "str_quest_chat_14784009": "Then you will understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_14784010": "Now get some rest, young man. Have a good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14784011": "Good night, Shadowlord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14785001": "I heard you injured your finger during your training?",
  "str_quest_chat_14785002": "Good evening, Shadowlord... How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_14785003": "Never forget, the shadows are always watching you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14785004": "S-Sure... (Even if it does sound a little creepy...)",
  "str_quest_chat_14785005": "How is your injury?",
  "str_quest_chat_14785006": "The others helped me bandage it up properly. It shouldn't leave a scar.",
  "str_quest_chat_14785007": "Then I am glad of it... Although scars are nothing to be worried about.",
  "str_quest_chat_14785008": "Thanks for your concern, Shadowlord. Oh yeah, I just remembered...",
  "str_quest_chat_14785009": "People refer to you as the Man of a Thousand Scars, don't they, Shadowlord?",
  "str_quest_chat_14785010": "Mmm, you are quite well-informed.",
  "str_quest_chat_14785011": "Is it... because your body is covered in scars?",
  "str_quest_chat_14785012": "It doesn't seem to be that way...",
  "str_quest_chat_14785013": "Scars are a symbol of the passage of time, but they should not be worn arrogantly.",
  "str_quest_chat_14785014": "Remember to get plenty of rest, my young friend. It will help with your recovery. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14785015": "G-Good night...",
  "str_quest_chat_14786001": "I've wanted to ask you... Are those fireflies your shadows?",
  "str_quest_chat_14786002": "Shadows? What do you mean by shadow?",
  "str_quest_chat_14786003": "I mean, are they your loyal servants?",
  "str_quest_chat_14786004": "Well... No.",
  "str_quest_chat_14786005": "Why would you ask that, Shadowlord?",
  "str_quest_chat_14786006": "Oh... Nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_14786007": "I'm still so obsessed with them...",
  "str_quest_chat_14786008": "They are all over the Colossus. If they were to be properly utilized...",
  "str_quest_chat_14786009": "They could serve as your eyes and ears. Do you understand?",
  "str_quest_chat_14786010": "N-No, I won't do that to them.",
  "str_quest_chat_14786011": "Also, it's not like they can do that anyway!",
  "str_quest_chat_14786012": "And that's why I'm here.",
  "str_quest_chat_14787001": "Good evening, young one.",
  "str_quest_chat_14787002": "Hello, Shadowlord.",
  "str_quest_chat_14787003": "You seem in very good spirits. I'm glad.",
  "str_quest_chat_14787004": "Because I had an excellent dinner, it put me in a good mood.",
  "str_quest_chat_14787005": "Well, a young man like you should be in good spirits.",
  "str_quest_chat_14787006": "I hope one day all the young folk of Umbraton will be like you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14788001": "The night is here.",
  "str_quest_chat_14788002": "The shadows will hide in the darkness. But they never leave.",
  "str_quest_chat_14788003": "That sounds... scary.",
  "str_quest_chat_14788004": "It is good to stay alert, youngster.",
  "str_quest_chat_14788005": "Always be aware of what may lurk in the darkness.",
  "str_quest_chat_14788006": "Yes, sir...",
  "str_quest_chat_14801001": "Navigator, have you seen Franz?",
  "str_quest_chat_14801002": "Franz has suddenly disappeared without a trace.",
  "str_quest_chat_14801003": "Franz is...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14801004": "A black, hairy, hearty, big-eyed dog, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_14801005": "The one that always follows me around.",
  "str_quest_chat_14801006": "Franz has gone missing. Damn... Where the heck did Franz go?",
  "str_quest_chat_14801007": "I haven't seen your dog... Maybe I can help you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14801008": "Help... Right, I need your help!",
  "str_quest_chat_14801009": "Franz is my most trusted companion... and he's missing.",
  "str_quest_chat_14801010": "I don't usually get up that early, but this morning I couldn't feel that furball at my side and I woke up in a daze.",
  "str_quest_chat_14801011": "Now my head's spinning with anxiety.",
  "str_quest_chat_14801012": "If you have any clues, please come to the <color=#FFB400>cafe</color>. I'm counting on you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14801999": "Where could Franz be? I've never seen Kafka so anxious. It's quite worrying... I should go find her in the cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_14861001": "Navigator, do you have dog food?",
  "str_quest_chat_14861002": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_14861003": "I do have some...",
  "str_quest_chat_14861004": "But why do you need dog food?",
  "str_quest_chat_14861005": "I'm gonna put it in your room... so Franz won't fool around my place.",
  "str_quest_chat_14861006": "And I would finally be able... to get a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_14861007": "You can just leave it to someone's care when you sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_14862001": "Lunch was delicious today.",
  "str_quest_chat_14862002": "I'm saying that for Franz.",
  "str_quest_chat_14862003": "What was for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_14862004": "Steak, very tasty.",
  "str_quest_chat_14862005": "Franz liked that?",
  "str_quest_chat_14862006": "I bet it was the premium steak that Vice managed to get from Illumina. Did Franz really like it?",
  "str_quest_chat_14862007": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_14862008": "I still have quite a bit left.",
  "str_quest_chat_14862009": "If it liked them so much, I'll have the Fireflies deliver them to your room.",
  "str_quest_chat_14862010": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14881001": "Are you awake? I need your help.",
  "str_quest_chat_14881002": "I'm awake, Kafka. What can I do for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14881003": "There's so much animal hair in my room! It's annoying!",
  "str_quest_chat_14881004": "All these hairs floating in the air... And now I can't stop sneezing!",
  "str_quest_chat_14881005": "Okay, I'll ask the Fireflies to get rid of the hair...",
  "str_quest_chat_14881006": "...But you don't actually think it's annoying, do you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14881007": "...You go and enjoy your night's sleep! I hope you dream of countless furry creatures, rubbing into your face and licking your nose!",
  "str_quest_chat_14881008": "...Fine, whatever—good night, Kafka!",
  "str_quest_chat_14882001": "Are you on duty?",
  "str_quest_chat_14882002": "It's a little late, but I have a question for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_14882003": "Well, your little things...",
  "str_quest_chat_14882004": "My little things?",
  "str_quest_chat_14882005": "What little things?",
  "str_quest_chat_14882006": "...The Fireflies, the Fireflies!",
  "str_quest_chat_14882007": "Are they simply machines or living beings?",
  "str_quest_chat_14882008": "Last time, Franz chased them until they seemed to make a sound—a sound like a male voice.",
  "str_quest_chat_14882009": "Hmm... If they made a sound, it was probably a recording.",
  "str_quest_chat_14882010": "They're not self-aware.",
  "str_quest_chat_14882011": "...Oh. Then you are not a villain, enslaving them in a life of servitude?",
  "str_quest_chat_14882012": "...Of course I'm not!",
  "str_quest_chat_14882013": "But Soroz is capable of very deep thought.",
  "str_quest_chat_14882014": "You mean the Colossus is alive?",
  "str_quest_chat_14882015": "Yes! Soroz is my best friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_14882016": "In that case, it seems we have something in common.",
  "str_quest_chat_14882017": "Well, then, go to bed early! I wish you a sound sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_14882018": "Thank you for your kindness... Kafka...",
  "str_quest_chat_14883001": "Are you awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_14883002": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_14883003": "Anything I can help you with, Kafka?",
  "str_quest_chat_14883004": "Is there anything round or glowing on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_14883005": "Fireflies?",
  "str_quest_chat_14883006": "Anything sturdier than that?",
  "str_quest_chat_14883007": "Nightium?",
  "str_quest_chat_14883008": "Anything bigger and harder to lose?",
  "str_quest_chat_14883009": "Franz's favorite ball went missing, so I'd like to get him a replacement.",
  "str_quest_chat_14883010": "I'm stumped on that one...",
  "str_quest_chat_14883011": "Sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat_14883012": "That's okay. I'll try someone else.",
  "str_quest_chat_14883013": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14883014": "Good night, Kafka.",
  "str_quest_chat_14884001": "You there?",
  "str_quest_chat_14884002": "Good evening, Kafka.",
  "str_quest_chat_14884003": "Got any snacks to eat around here?",
  "str_quest_chat_14884004": "I've been guarding the place for a while now, and there aren't any snacks in sight... What kind of Colossus are you running here?",
  "str_quest_chat_14884005": "Y-You've been guarding the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_14884006": "You really don't have to, Kafka. I can assure you the Colossus is perfectly safe.",
  "str_quest_chat_14884007": "Hmph. Telling me to stop just to keep from sharing your snacks, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_14884008": "You know what? Forget I said anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_14884009": "Franz already found some tasty honey cakes for me to eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_14884010": "B-But I was going to give those out to everyone tomorrow...",
  "str_quest_chat_14885001": "It's so quiet.",
  "str_quest_chat_14885002": "Well, it's pretty late, after all. Everyone's probably asleep by now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14885003": "Your guests here are pretty good about having a regular daily routine, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_14885004": "Not like those Rediesel Wrench goons. Those guys usually party all night and sleep all day.",
  "str_quest_chat_14885005": "It's not always this quiet every night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14885006": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_14885007": "Then it looks like I should try to get some sleep while I still can.",
  "str_quest_chat_14885008": "Hopefully the circles around my eyes will be gone by tomorrow...",
  "str_quest_chat_14885009": "Will one night of sleep really get rid of them...?",
  "str_quest_chat_14885010": "Ugh, let a girl dream, would you?! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_14885011": "Good night...",
  "str_quest_chat_14901001": "PlayerName, have you lost anything recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_14901002": "Huh? Why do you ask?",
  "str_quest_chat_14901003": "Well, I just saw you poking around like you're searching for something.",
  "str_quest_chat_14901004": "N-No, it's okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_14901005": "Maybe I shouldn't have asked...",
  "str_quest_chat_14901006": "Anyway, I might have a clue for you. Come and meet me at the <color=#FFB400>bar</color>.",
  "str_quest_chat_14901999": "Leona said she might have a clue. I should head to the bar and talk to her.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902001": "Have you ever seen another dragon before, kiddo?",
  "str_quest_chat_14902002": "Another dragon? I remember explaining to you that Soroz isn't a dragon...",
  "str_quest_chat_14902003": "No, I'm talking about my sister, Sharona. Another poor wretch tortured by hatred.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902004": "Like me, dragon blood flows through her veins, and like me, she is possessed by a pathetic enmity.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902005": "I see... You both have some kind of revenge to enact?",
  "str_quest_chat_14902006": "That's right. Hopeless and miserable.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902007": "It seems we share a similar destiny.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902008": "Really? Kiddo, do you hold a hatred in your heart that must be resolved? Do you find yourself controlled by your wrath?",
  "str_quest_chat_14902009": "A pathetic enmity?",
  "str_quest_chat_14902010": "Right. That hopeless and miserable enmity.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902011": "Don't... Don't say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902012": "Oh? And why is that?",
  "str_quest_chat_14902013": "It's something I must live with, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902014": "You live with it, too? Do you find yourself controlled by your hatred?",
  "str_quest_chat_14902015": "Controlled? Why would you use such a strange word?",
  "str_quest_chat_14902016": "Because the hatred in my heart often tries to control me.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902017": "It yearns to see me desperate to release my anger and destroy everything in sight. It's a pity that it cannot succeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902018": "Well, that's good... I wouldn't want you to destroy Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902019": "Oh? That's a shame... But if I wanted to, you wouldn't be able to stop me.",
  "str_quest_chat_14902020": "Huh!?...",
  "str_quest_chat_14941001": "Kiddo, are you the one this white dragon follows?",
  "str_quest_chat_14941002": "White dragon? You mean Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_14941003": "Yes, I'm the navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_14941004": "Navigator? You mean, this dragon... lets you control it?",
  "str_quest_chat_14941005": "Such a noble creature... and such an insignificant guy...",
  "str_quest_chat_14941006": "H-Hold on... Creature? That's not it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14941007": "Soroz isn't a \"creature\" exactly... He's a Colossus, a symbiote of the machine and biological entity.",
  "str_quest_chat_14941008": "It's not a creature...? It's made of... machinery?",
  "str_quest_chat_14941009": "Well, he's half and half...",
  "str_quest_chat_14941010": "Ah... I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_14941011": "Well, of course. How could a kid like you control a real dragon?",
  "str_quest_chat_14941012": "I was over-thinking things.",
  "str_quest_chat_14941013": "I don't quite understand what you mean...",
  "str_quest_chat_14941014": "But it's clear that you don't like me!",
  "str_quest_chat_14961001": "Oh... You've already had your meal, kiddo?",
  "str_quest_chat_14961002": "Uh-huh. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_14961003": "Do you have anything for Sunstone to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_14961004": "Erm... Maybe you can ask Vivian?",
  "str_quest_chat_14961005": "Tsk, I only came to ask you because I didn't want to ask her!",
  "str_quest_chat_14961006": "Alright... Let me have a look.",
  "str_quest_chat_14962001": "Remember to rest well during your lunch break, kiddo.",
  "str_quest_chat_14962002": "Understood...",
  "str_quest_chat_14962003": "You seem a little reluctant...",
  "str_quest_chat_14962004": "No, no, no... I'm just a little surprised...",
  "str_quest_chat_14963001": "I don't see fire often on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_14963002": "That's right. Fire is the last thing I'd want here.",
  "str_quest_chat_14963003": "Because it'll hurt the living side of the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_14963004": "Well, that's part of the reason...",
  "str_quest_chat_14963005": "But why do you need a fire?",
  "str_quest_chat_14963006": "For practice, with Sunstone, especially.",
  "str_quest_chat_14963007": "Just... watch out, please.",
  "str_quest_chat_14964001": "Good afternoon, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_14964002": "Afternoon, Leona!",
  "str_quest_chat_14964003": "Never mind, this daily greeting thing is still not for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_14964004": "You take it easy. Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_14964005": "Oh, uh, bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_14981001": "Hey kid, if you're not asleep yet, why not chat with me for a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_14981002": "Huh? Sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_14981003": "Tell me, what are we living for?",
  "str_quest_chat_14981004": "That's an awfully profound way to start up a conversation...",
  "str_quest_chat_14981005": "Sounds like you don't have an answer for that, either.",
  "str_quest_chat_14981006": "I don't think this question has a definite answer, to be honest.",
  "str_quest_chat_14981007": "So why don't you tell me a few answers, then?",
  "str_quest_chat_14981008": "How about family?",
  "str_quest_chat_14981009": "Tch, what's the good of family if you can't choose them?",
  "str_quest_chat_14981010": "How about love?",
  "str_quest_chat_14981011": "Oho? Such a brat like you knows a thing or two about this, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_14981012": "N-Not really...",
  "str_quest_chat_14981013": "Ahem... What about friendship?",
  "str_quest_chat_14981014": "Please. I have no friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_14981015": "Then... if you aren't willing to live for other people...",
  "str_quest_chat_14981016": "You could always live for yourself, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_14981017": "...Live for myself?",
  "str_quest_chat_14981018": "Looks like coming to you for a chat was the right choice, kiddo.",
  "str_quest_chat_14982001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_14982002": "It's the rowdiest time in Umbraton again, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_14982003": "Oh? What's happening?",
  "str_quest_chat_14982004": "You'll probably see some limbs on fire flying across your window...",
  "str_quest_chat_14982005": "And maybe some shrieking cries out of abject failure...",
  "str_quest_chat_14982006": "But it should all die down by dawn.",
  "str_quest_chat_14982007": "That sounds... horrifying.",
  "str_quest_chat_14982008": "So those like you should stay inside when in town.",
  "str_quest_chat_14982009": "Do you understand?",
  "str_quest_chat_14982010": "G-Got it!",
  "str_quest_chat_14982011": "Good. Now, go to sleep. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14982012": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14983001": "What do you do when you're bored, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_14983002": "Let me think...",
  "str_quest_chat_14983003": "Usually this late at night, when it's not convenient to go out...",
  "str_quest_chat_14983004": "I'd probably watch the stars?",
  "str_quest_chat_14983005": "I once tried to follow the books and identify the different constellations.",
  "str_quest_chat_14983006": "But I still can't make heads or tails of them...",
  "str_quest_chat_14983007": "I'd probably read a book?",
  "str_quest_chat_14983008": "I may have read numerous books several times by now...",
  "str_quest_chat_14983009": "But I always pick up on something new each time!",
  "str_quest_chat_14983010": "That's certainly an answer I'd expect from a kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_14983011": "Mediocre, but I'll take it under consideration.",
  "str_quest_chat_14984001": "Can you come to keep Sunstone company?",
  "str_quest_chat_14984002": "Why? Is something wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_14984003": "I don't know why, but Sunstone just won't go to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_14984004": "I didn't know Sunstone could suffer from insomnia.",
  "str_quest_chat_14984005": "Or maybe... It's because you're having trouble sleeping yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_14984006": "Didn't anyone ever tell you to keep your mouth shut when you don't have anything nice to say, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_14984007": "Ah, forget it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14984008": "I'm going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_14984009": "G-Good night...",
  "str_quest_chat_14985001": "Hey, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_14985002": "What do you think Sharona's up to right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_14985003": "Well, it's pretty late... I'd say she's sleeping right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_14985004": "You really think she's the type to go to bed at a reasonable time?",
  "str_quest_chat_14985005": "You have a point... As an Illumina Commander, she must be pretty busy all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_14985006": "Hey, the commanders aren't the only ones who stay busy! I've got plenty on my plate too!",
  "str_quest_chat_14985007": "Is that why you're chatting with me right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_14985008": "... Sorry, can't chat, got work to do! Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_14985009": "You should try to get some rest if you don't have anything else to do, Leona...",
  "str_quest_chat_14985010": "Nope! I'm plenty busy!",
  "str_quest_chat_14986001": "My hatred feels much clearer during the night.",
  "str_quest_chat_14986002": "Wh-Who do you hate now, Leona?",
  "str_quest_chat_14986003": "I hate that island floating high in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_14986004": "I hate those self-aggrandizing nobles living on it.",
  "str_quest_chat_14986005": "I hate that sister of mine for letting go of the past.",
  "str_quest_chat_14986006": "But at the end of the day, maybe I just hate myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_14986007": "Leona...",
  "str_quest_chat_14986008": "Hey, you're not pitying me, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14986009": "I didn't mean any of that just now... You didn't believe me, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat_14986010": "Anyway, just go to bed already, kid!",
  "str_quest_chat_14986011": "Good night...",
  "str_quest_chat_14987001": "Hahahaha! Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_14987002": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_14987003": "You seem like you're in a good mood tonight, Leona.",
  "str_quest_chat_14987004": "Think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_14987005": "Don't I always look like this?",
  "str_quest_chat_14987006": "You've never sounded this happy before when you greeted me.",
  "str_quest_chat_14987007": "Did the Shadowlord praise you or something?",
  "str_quest_chat_14987008": "How did you know...?!",
  "str_quest_chat_14987009": "Hmph! A-Anyway, keep your nose out of my business unless you want me to break it! Understand?",
  "str_quest_chat_14987010": "I just thought you wanted to share some good news, is all.",
  "str_quest_chat_14987011": "I don't have pointless feelings like that, now go to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_14987012": "There's really no making sense of her sometimes...",
  "str_quest_chat_15001001": "I hear you've been looking for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_15001002": "Regardless of what I think, I'm sure this must have something to do with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15001003": "What's wrong? From your tone, it almost seems as though I have done something wrong.",
  "str_quest_chat_15001004": "No... I wouldn't say that, exactly...",
  "str_quest_chat_15001005": "Anyway... Can we talk for a minute?",
  "str_quest_chat_15001006": "Sure, but please wait a moment... Hey, you're not planning to invite me on a date, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_15001007": "W-What!? What are you saying!?",
  "str_quest_chat_15001008": "You look so nervous. I was just kidding, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_15001009": "Please don't joke around about things like that!",
  "str_quest_chat_15001010": "There's no need to be rude...",
  "str_quest_chat_15001011": "Yes, it's a date...",
  "str_quest_chat_15001012": "Oh? How interesting. I'm looking forward to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_15001013": "That's not what I meant! Stop taking everything I say the wrong way!",
  "str_quest_chat_15001014": "We're going out! It's so exciting!",
  "str_quest_chat_15001015": "Anyway, let's meet in the <color=#FFB400>lounge</color>.",
  "str_quest_chat_15001016": "I'll go get ready then!",
  "str_quest_chat_15001031": "Looking for me again?",
  "str_quest_chat_15001032": "We made an agreement! You said you would tell me about you!",
  "str_quest_chat_15001033": "How could you stand me up like that!?",
  "str_quest_chat_15001034": "You misunderstood. I thought you were immersed in your grief so I went to pray for you first.",
  "str_quest_chat_15001035": "I... I misunderstood?",
  "str_quest_chat_15001036": "That's right, you misunderstood.",
  "str_quest_chat_15001037": "Don't lie to me!",
  "str_quest_chat_15001038": "It makes me sad to hear you say that...",
  "str_quest_chat_15001039": "Ah... I-I'm sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat_15001040": "No!... How is this happening to me again!?",
  "str_quest_chat_15001041": "Alright, enough joking around. I haven't forgotten our agreement.",
  "str_quest_chat_15001999": "I need to tidy up and go find Uriah!",
  "str_quest_chat_15041001": "I would like to express my utmost respect to you with the supreme courtesy of Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041002": "Uh... Thanks. But isn't that a little over the top?",
  "str_quest_chat_15041003": "This level of etiquette is essential, whether you're awake or fast asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041004": "I always feel like there's something more hidden in your words...",
  "str_quest_chat_15041005": "I apologize if I've caused you any distress.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041006": "It's an occupational hazard. I can't help remembering and expressing my grief... The praying, the mourning...",
  "str_quest_chat_15041007": "Although these sacred eulogies are supposed to send off the departed, they are more important for appeasing the living.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041008": "Life is beautiful, and the glory of the dead will shine on the living.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041009": "Of course, it will.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041010": "However, I'd like to apologize again. It is not my intention to bring you harm.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041011": "I'm afraid that all I can do to earn your forgiveness is to present you with this white flower I grew myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041012": "I hope its white petals may soothe your wounded heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041013": "Thank you, this white flower is beautiful... But isn't it a reagent for your... work?",
  "str_quest_chat_15041014": "Please don't worry. Although it's a farewell flower, it doesn't mean it's some kind of vicious curse. On the contrary, it is a blessing.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041015": "A blessing?",
  "str_quest_chat_15041016": "No one can accompany you throughout the loneliness of life, but those who bid you farewell will continue to warm your heart from the depths of your memories.",
  "str_quest_chat_15041017": "Its unfading white petals will be painted by the colors of life, forever surrounding you so that you will never be lonely.",
  "str_quest_chat_15051001": "Greetings. Are you up yet, my lord?",
  "str_quest_chat_15051002": "I don't know why... but being called a \"Lord\" always makes me feel uncomfortable...",
  "str_quest_chat_15051003": "So if you ever run into children from Keating, you might find yourself feeling very uncomfortable indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_15051004": "It's not just me... I think most people feel uncomfortable when running into them.",
  "str_quest_chat_15052001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_15052002": "Ah, good morning, Uriah.",
  "str_quest_chat_15052003": "Why does your hair look like it exploded?",
  "str_quest_chat_15052004": "Is it because you just woke up and failed to comb it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15052005": "Ah! I-I'll go fix it right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_15052006": "Wait... How can you even see my hair right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_15052007": "You're not in my room, are you...?",
  "str_quest_chat_15052008": "No, I was simply making an educated guess on a clear possibility.",
  "str_quest_chat_15052009": "It seems my guess was correct.",
  "str_quest_chat_15053001": "Good morning. Would you like to join me in prayer?",
  "str_quest_chat_15053002": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_15053003": "In that case, allow me to begin.",
  "str_quest_chat_15053004": "But I don't really know what to pray for...",
  "str_quest_chat_15053005": "No, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_15053006": "I don't really know what to pray for...",
  "str_quest_chat_15053007": "It's pretty simple. Come, let us pray together...",
  "str_quest_chat_15053008": "For a wonderful breakfast this morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_15053009": "But... I've already grabbed my breakfast...",
  "str_quest_chat_15053010": "Well... Breakfast always tastes better after prayer!",
  "str_quest_chat_15053011": "Is that really true?",
  "str_quest_chat_15054001": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_15054002": "Didn't sleep well last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_15054003": "Yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat_15054004": "I dreamed that I was being chased by 100 Eclipsites...",
  "str_quest_chat_15054005": "Then you woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't get back to sleep anymore?",
  "str_quest_chat_15054006": "Wait, how did you know?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15054007": "Keating saw the dark circles under your eyes when passing through the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat_15054008": "And then they told me about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_15054009": "They didn't say anything bad about me, did they?",
  "str_quest_chat_15054010": "They just gave a factual report of your situation.",
  "str_quest_chat_15054011": "Except in their... unique way.",
  "str_quest_chat_15054012": "That doesn't sound promising...",
  "str_quest_chat_15054013": "They must have mocked me again...",
  "str_quest_chat_15054014": "They always do.",
  "str_quest_chat_15054015": "People always complain about it, but they never change.",
  "str_quest_chat_15054016": "If one day they suddenly were to become polite...",
  "str_quest_chat_15054017": "I think that'd actually be even more terrifying.",
  "str_quest_chat_15054018": "Would you like to rest and get some more sleep now?",
  "str_quest_chat_15054019": "Yeah... I'd like to sleep a little longer.",
  "str_quest_chat_15054020": "Sweet dreams, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_15055001": "Greetings, and good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_15055002": "Good morning, Uriah!",
  "str_quest_chat_15055003": "Did you sleep well last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_15055004": "Yeah, I did!",
  "str_quest_chat_15055005": "It appears my prayers were heard, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_15055006": "Not really...",
  "str_quest_chat_15055007": "It appears my prayers went unanswered this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_15055008": "I'll pray even more fervently for you tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_15055009": "Y-You really don't have to! I'll just try to go to bed a little earlier!",
  "str_quest_chat_15055010": "Wonderful! I'm thrilled to see you finally come to this conclusion.",
  "str_quest_chat_15055011": "My prayers have been answered, after all!",
  "str_quest_chat_15055012": "So this is what you were actually praying for, huh...?",
  "str_quest_chat_15056001": "Greetings.",
  "str_quest_chat_15056002": "Oh, good morning, Uriah.",
  "str_quest_chat_15056003": "Were you satisfied with your breakfast this morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_15056004": "Well, I made breakfast for myself this morning, so... Yeah, it was fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_15056005": "I see. I took the liberty of switching the meat in your breakfast with sandworm meat. I had no idea you liked it so much!",
  "str_quest_chat_15056006": "What? Wh-When did you do that?! I didn't even notice the difference!",
  "str_quest_chat_15056007": "Then again, after being forced to eat sandworms by the Rediesel Wrench so many times...",
  "str_quest_chat_15056008": "I guess I'm not all that opposed to it anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_15056009": "Is that so? Then I must find something even more special for your meals now.",
  "str_quest_chat_15056010": "Ah, I've got it! That raw lizard meat I had last time should be perfect!",
  "str_quest_chat_15056011": "Why do I feel your tastes are even crazier than the Rediesel Wrench's, Uriah?",
  "str_quest_chat_15081001": "Are you asleep, Navigator? Even if you have matters to attend to, you shouldn't force yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_15081002": "I know. I'll try to go to bed earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_15081003": "No, just go to sleep now, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_15081004": "Well, I suppose there's no dissuading you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15082001": "Another day gradually fades away...",
  "str_quest_chat_15082002": "You sound kind of glum, Uriah.",
  "str_quest_chat_15082003": "Not at all. I am just somewhat sensitive to the idea of transience.",
  "str_quest_chat_15082004": "All things must come to pass in their own time.",
  "str_quest_chat_15082005": "When you put it that way, now I can't help but feel down...",
  "str_quest_chat_15082006": "There's no need to feel sad, Navigator. We are capable of accomplishing so much, even with the bit of time given to us.",
  "str_quest_chat_15082007": "We can offer our sincerest condolences for the days that have come and gone.",
  "str_quest_chat_15082008": "We can also go to bed earlier...",
  "str_quest_chat_15082009": "So that we may wake and greet the new day with open arms.",
  "str_quest_chat_15082010": "I agree. Well then, I'm off to bed. Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_15082011": "Good night, and may you rest in peace.",
  "str_quest_chat_15082012": "H-Huh? Are you...? What was that?",
  "str_quest_chat_15082013": "I am simply mourning the passing of the Navigator of today.",
  "str_quest_chat_15082014": "As for the Navigator of tomorrow, I am prepared to offer my warmest blessings.",
  "str_quest_chat_15083001": "It is quite late, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_15083002": "Do you still have much to do for today?",
  "str_quest_chat_15083003": "Not really. I'm chatting with everyone, including you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15083004": "To be able to spend your nights happily chatting with your friends...",
  "str_quest_chat_15083005": "You are blessed, indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_15083006": "Thanks. But I'm worried about my health if I keep staying up late like this...",
  "str_quest_chat_15083007": "I'll pray for your health. And if you are sick someday, I will offer my condolences to your lost health.",
  "str_quest_chat_15083008": "I think... I should go to bed now. Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_15083009": "Good night, and may you rest in peace.",
  "str_quest_chat_15084001": "Will you mourn for things lost, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_15084002": "Such as times past, sunset, and shooting stars.",
  "str_quest_chat_15084003": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_15084004": "To be precise, it's more of feeling sad over wasted time...",
  "str_quest_chat_15084005": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_15084006": "Things like that happen too often...",
  "str_quest_chat_15084007": "If you mourn everything, you'll just wallow in sorrow all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_15084008": "What about you, Uriah?",
  "str_quest_chat_15084009": "I'd eulogize every such loss.",
  "str_quest_chat_15084010": "Whether it has anything to do with me or not.",
  "str_quest_chat_15085001": "Greetings, honorable fool! Can you guess who I am?",
  "str_quest_chat_15085002": "Uh, this isn't Uriah?",
  "str_quest_chat_15085003": "Wait, that speech sounds awfully familiar... Is that you, Keating?",
  "str_quest_chat_15085004": "Wrong.",
  "str_quest_chat_15085005": "It is I, Uriah.",
  "str_quest_chat_15085006": "... So it was you, after all. Why would you make me guess?",
  "str_quest_chat_15085007": "What a dull question.",
  "str_quest_chat_15085008": "I simply wished to greet you in a new and exciting way.",
  "str_quest_chat_15085009": "O-Oh, I see... Thanks, I guess?",
  "str_quest_chat_15085010": "No thanks are necessary. Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_15085011": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_15086001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_15086002": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_15086003": "It appears you are still awake... As expected.",
  "str_quest_chat_15086004": "Yeah, I just finished my work.",
  "str_quest_chat_15086005": "I'm pretty tired, but my mind is still really active.",
  "str_quest_chat_15086006": "I was just playing some games.",
  "str_quest_chat_15086007": "I'm still pretty awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_15086008": "In that case, would you like to join me in prayer?",
  "str_quest_chat_15086009": "After a hundred rounds of prayer, I assure you, you'll be perfectly ready for bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_15086010": "But what should I pray for?",
  "str_quest_chat_15086011": "Hmm... Why not pray for more funerals for me to preside over?",
  "str_quest_chat_15086012": "... Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_15101001": "Navigator, are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_15101002": "I'm resting. Do you need something?",
  "str_quest_chat_15101003": "Of course! Come to the bridge!",
  "str_quest_chat_15101004": "Ah... What? Now?",
  "str_quest_chat_15101005": "Meow, Philyshy is waiting for you at the <color=#FFB400>bridge</color>!",
  "str_quest_chat_15101999": "It seems Philyshy wants to ask me something. I should go to the bridge and find her.",
  "str_quest_chat_15102001": "Huh? You've got some dried fish?",
  "str_quest_chat_15102002": "Dried fish? That's something cats love to eat, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_15102003": "Why are you talking about fish all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_15102004": "Meow! Because I'm a cat, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_15102005": "Huh? Is that... Yumi?",
  "str_quest_chat_15102006": "No, I remember you have loads of that stuff!",
  "str_quest_chat_15102007": "I've already eaten them, meow! They were so delicious, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15102008": "Without dried fish, who knows what will become of Philyshy, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15102009": "I remember you buying a big bag yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat_15102010": "It's all gone, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15102011": "What? That was such a big bag!",
  "str_quest_chat_15102012": "It was so delicious so I finished it all! What's the problem, meow!?",
  "str_quest_chat_15102013": "It was so delicious that I still want to eat more! That's why I came to you, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15102014": "G-Got it... I'll think of something...",
  "str_quest_chat_15102015": "But that was way too fast... Next time, should I get Philyshy to buy some gross dried fish?",
  "str_quest_chat_15102016": "Hey, I'm listening! Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15141001": "Ah, I'm sleepy, but I thought I'd come to say hello anyway!",
  "str_quest_chat_15141002": "But if I suddenly fall asleep, don't be surprised—midday is the perfect time for sleeping!",
  "str_quest_chat_15141003": "I can't help but agree with the second half of that sentence...",
  "str_quest_chat_15141004": "Really? Well, I can't help but agree, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_15141005": "So does Yumi!",
  "str_quest_chat_15141006": "Yumi? Who's Yumi?",
  "str_quest_chat_15141007": "Yumi is my cat, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15141008": "Oh, it's your pet.",
  "str_quest_chat_15141009": "It's me, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15141010": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_15141011": "You see, Yumi is Philyshy, and Philyshy is Yumi. Our personalities may be a little different, but we both like to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_15141012": "Wait, you're both one person...? Or are you two people?",
  "str_quest_chat_15141013": "Huh? Philyshy... or is it Yumi? Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_15142001": "Waaah... Isn't there any way I can take my strength down a notch?",
  "str_quest_chat_15142002": "Huh? I've never heard anyone ask for something like that before...",
  "str_quest_chat_15142003": "The less powerful you are, the less responsibility you're burdened with!",
  "str_quest_chat_15142004": "Why would you possibly want to be weaker?",
  "str_quest_chat_15142005": "Because if I get stronger, I'll have fewer excuses for sleeping in.",
  "str_quest_chat_15142006": "Ah... Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_15142007": "Really.",
  "str_quest_chat_15142008": "If Philyshy grows weaker, there won't be so many people coming to Philyshy for help.",
  "str_quest_chat_15142009": "Then I can sleep in more!",
  "str_quest_chat_15142010": "So that's it...",
  "str_quest_chat_15142011": "But if you get stronger, Philyshy can protect everyone, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_15142012": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_15142013": "Huh... That makes sense!",
  "str_quest_chat_15142014": "Right. You should be happy that you're growing stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_15142015": "Alright then! Let's celebrate by taking a nap! Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15151001": "Meow, I'm sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_15151002": "Good morning, Philyshy. I see you're the same as ever...",
  "str_quest_chat_15151003": "Meow... There's nothing \"good\" about the morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_15151004": "I'm going back to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_15151005": "Sweet dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_15152001": "Meow, there's nothing quite like milk for breakfast!",
  "str_quest_chat_15152002": "Do you like it? I'll bring some more next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_15152003": "Meow? Did you bring that for me?",
  "str_quest_chat_15152004": "Yeah... I'm in charge of the procurement today.",
  "str_quest_chat_15152005": "In that case... I'm counting on you!",

  "str_quest_chat_15153002": "Morning, Philyshy...",
  "str_quest_chat_15153003": "That's the first time I've ever heard that complaint...",
  "str_quest_chat_15153004": "Well, the first thing in the morning should always be to rub up against something, meow...",
  "str_quest_chat_15153005": "But the nightstand... Meow! It's way too hard! Rubbing against it is so uncomfortable...",
  "str_quest_chat_15153006": "Uh... Do you want me to put a cushion on it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15153007": "Heehee, if it's not too much trouble, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15154001": "How rude... Who woke Philyshy up with all that racket...?",
  "str_quest_chat_15154002": "Hmm? I haven't heard anything all morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_15154003": "The sound of cooking, footsteps all over the place... And it sounded like some dumb Aurorian dropped a plate or two on the floor...",
  "str_quest_chat_15154004": "Philyshy can hear every noise in this place!!",
  "str_quest_chat_15154005": "I... I don't know if that's something we can really fix...",
  "str_quest_chat_15154006": "Meow... Looks like Philyshy will have to go all the way down, as far from everyone as possible, to get some sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_15155001": "Meow... I'm done for, meow...",
  "str_quest_chat_15155002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_15155003": "Dried fish is yummy and so is milk, meow...",
  "str_quest_chat_15155004": "So I mixed them together.",
  "str_quest_chat_15155005": "And it tasted gross, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15155006": "I should chuck them away before my superiors notice it, meow!",

  "str_quest_chat_15161001": "Have you ever had a big dried fish?",
  "str_quest_chat_15161002": "Big dried fish? What's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_15161003": "Said to be made with a kind of fish in a river near Umbraton, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15161004": "It was preserved with salt, then let the sun dry it. It'll taste special, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15161005": "It's also huge! Like so big you gotta hold it with both hands! And you can eat it for a month!",
  "str_quest_chat_15161006": "If you ever went to Umbraton, be sure to get me one, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15161007": "Sure. I can do that.",
  "str_quest_chat_15161008": "Wait! Aren't you the Intel Chief, Philyshy?",
  "str_quest_chat_15161009": "You can go to Umbraton too, can't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_15161010": "But, but... It costs money...",
  "str_quest_chat_15161011": "I-I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_15162001": "No... No! Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15162002": "Are you there? Are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_15162003": "Huh? Philyshy? What do you want from me?",
  "str_quest_chat_15162004": "I-I can't find my dessert! Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15162005": "Do you know where it went?",
  "str_quest_chat_15162006": "Is it that sweet osmanthus flavor?",
  "str_quest_chat_15162007": "No way! Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15162008": "Is that dessert dessert flavor, or what?",
  "str_quest_chat_15162009": "What are you talking about! Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15162010": "You really don't know where it is?",
  "str_quest_chat_15162011": "I really don't know.",
  "str_quest_chat_15162012": "Hmm... Okay, I'll carry on looking! Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15163001": "Hi, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_15163002": "I had a dream just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_15163003": "Huh? Just now? You were dreaming in the afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_15163004": "... Don't worry about that! Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15163005": "In my dream, I wasn't an intelligence officer.",
  "str_quest_chat_15163006": "But it was all a little vague.",
  "str_quest_chat_15163007": "PlayerName, if I weren't an officer, what do you think I would be good at?",
  "str_quest_chat_15163008": "How about becoming a fish hunter?",
  "str_quest_chat_15163009": "You could be a master Taiyaki chef?",
  "str_quest_chat_15163010": "It sounds exhausting... Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15163011": "I'm good for now.",
  "str_quest_chat_15163012": "Well, time to go back to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_15163013": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_15164001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_15164002": "Huh? Philyshy.",
  "str_quest_chat_15164003": "Hmph! Things have been pretty good with Philyshy recently, meow.",
  "str_quest_chat_15164004": "Huh? Oh, it's Yumi.",
  "str_quest_chat_15164005": "A shop in Umbraton had a sale on dried fish recently, so I bought a lot for Philyshy.",
  "str_quest_chat_15164006": "Of course...",
  "str_quest_chat_15164007": "Oh? Are you jealous?",
  "str_quest_chat_15164008": "Are you jealous of her dried fish?",
  "str_quest_chat_15164009": "Why would I be, silly?",
  "str_quest_chat_15164010": "Next time, I'll buy more and give some to Yumi.",
  "str_quest_chat_15164011": "Hmph...",
  "str_quest_chat_15164012": "I'm going to bed, meow.",
  "str_quest_chat_15165001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_15165002": "Are you busy?",
  "str_quest_chat_15165003": "No, I'm not busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_15165004": "Oh? I wanted to teach you something about being lazy.",
  "str_quest_chat_15165005": "It looks like you're already a pro.",
  "str_quest_chat_15165006": "Please, teach me everything you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_15165007": "Yeah, I know all there's to know about slack-off.",
  "str_quest_chat_15165008": "But of course, it wouldn't hurt to learn a little more.",
  "str_quest_chat_15165009": "Heehee! If you wanna know more, you need to bribe me with dried fish.",
  "str_quest_chat_15165010": "Sure. I'll send some right over.",
  "str_quest_chat_15181001": "So annoying! Meow! Where are you?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15181002": "G-Good evening...? What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_15181003": "My fish jerky... Give back Philyshy's fish jerky!",
  "str_quest_chat_15181004": "You sound like you're starving... Did you not eat dinner today?",
  "str_quest_chat_15181005": "Save the talk and hand over the fish!",
  "str_quest_chat_15181006": "Uh... Have you tried looking in the kitchen?",
  "str_quest_chat_15181007": "I'm not sure if we still have any fish jerky left, but if I remember correctly...",
  "str_quest_chat_15181008": "I think we managed to secure a few fresh fish today?",
  "str_quest_chat_15181009": "Meow? Fresh fish?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15181010": "You're a goner if I don't find any, you hear me?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15181011": "Ah... It's very late, but Philyshy doesn't seem very concerned with eating healthy, does she...?",
  "str_quest_chat_15182001": "Evening, Navigator. Do you dream in your sleep often?",
  "str_quest_chat_15182002": "Yeah, but most of the time I don't remember my dreams very well.",
  "str_quest_chat_15182003": "Meow? I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_15182004": "Then, what if you managed to remember a dream purrfectly?",
  "str_quest_chat_15182005": "Well, if I had a nightmare, I'd try my best to forget about it...",
  "str_quest_chat_15182006": "But if I had a nice dream, I'd try to remember it for as long as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_15182007": "Meow... What if you couldn't tell if it was a good dream or a bad one?",
  "str_quest_chat_15182008": "Hmm... I guess I'd leave it alone, and focus my attention on reality or something?",
  "str_quest_chat_15182009": "But if I were you, Philyshy...",
  "str_quest_chat_15182010": "Meow?",
  "str_quest_chat_15182011": "I think eating a few extra sticks of fish jerky would be helpful to forget all about it. Don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_15182012": "Wow! That's a great idea!",
  "str_quest_chat_15183001": "Good evening... Meow, today was a real cat-astrophe...",
  "str_quest_chat_15183002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_15183003": "Commander Vivian, Commander Sharona, and Vice all got together today...",
  "str_quest_chat_15183004": "They looked like they were talking about something really important...",
  "str_quest_chat_15183005": "They all had their backs turned towards me...",
  "str_quest_chat_15183006": "A fluffy, white tail... A long, slender tail... And a thick, black tail...",
  "str_quest_chat_15183007": "Waving nonstop all over the place! Meeeeooow!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_15183008": "I couldn't stop myself! Meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15183009": "I-I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_15183010": "It's fine. It's in your nature, after all...",
  "str_quest_chat_15184001": "Meow! Did you hear that ringing just now?",
  "str_quest_chat_15184002": "Good evening, Philyshy... It's pretty late, you know...",
  "str_quest_chat_15184003": "Of course, meow. Philyshy knows it's late! It's so hard to sleep after hearing that ringing!",
  "str_quest_chat_15184004": "Then... What should we do?",
  "str_quest_chat_15184005": "Should I have the Fireflies go take a look?",
  "str_quest_chat_15184006": "Maybe I can help you look for it tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat_15184007": "Meow...",
  "str_quest_chat_15184008": "Hmm? Philyshy? Did she fall asleep...?",
  "str_quest_chat_15184009": "Hah... Philyshy's got you now...!",
  "str_quest_chat_15184010": "Turns out, the ringing was coming from Philyshy's own room...",
  "str_quest_chat_15184011": "...Was it a toy that you brought back with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_15184012": "Meow? No! Even Philyshy doesn't know how this got here!",
  "str_quest_chat_15184013": "Anyways, time for a nice, long catnap. Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_15185001": "Ugh, I hate spitting up hairballs, meow...",
  "str_quest_chat_15185002": "Spitting up hairballs?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15185003": "That's the price cats pay for health and emotional stability, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15185004": "Uh... Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_15185005": "Are you feeling well?",
  "str_quest_chat_15185006": "Not my belly... meow...",
  "str_quest_chat_15185007": "Meow. I always want snacks after spitting up a hairball!",
  "str_quest_chat_15185008": "Dried fish, dried fish! Yumi and I are coming for you, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15185009": "I knew it!",
  "str_quest_chat_15201999": "Something's troubling Ophina. Go see what you can do!",
  "str_quest_chat_15241001": "Music is like gliding birds, holding teardrops that gently fall by your window.",
  "str_quest_chat_15241002": "Meeting you for the first time, I gently greet you by plucking these strings.",
  "str_quest_chat_15241003": "Hi, I'm the Colossus' Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_15241004": "You answered me? Thank you.",

  "str_quest_chat_15241006": "Huh? Did I say something wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_15241007": "My tears... They flow for you...",
  "str_quest_chat_15241008": "Was there something wrong with the way I said hello?",
  "str_quest_chat_15241009": "There's no need to be nervous.",
  "str_quest_chat_15241010": "I cry all the time, but these tears are not of sadness; they are tears of joy.",
  "str_quest_chat_15241011": "What trick of fate allowed us to meet?",
  "str_quest_chat_15241012": "Like ice waiting for its moment to thaw, like stars waiting for their moment to fall.",
  "str_quest_chat_15241013": "Our encounter ends at that moment, becoming an eternal kiss.",
  "str_quest_chat_15241014": "My tears are for the sake of the meeting.",
  "str_quest_chat_15251001": "Greetings from dawn and morning dews, courtesy of the soft strings.",

  "str_quest_chat_15261001": "Hello... Navigator. It's such a nice day today.",
  "str_quest_chat_15261002": "Really? Great. Let's do the laundry now.",
  "str_quest_chat_15261003": "Huh? Shouldn't you just ask your little minions on the Colossus to do it for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_15261004": "The Fireflies? I haven't been letting them do the laundry recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_15261005": "You've grown up.",

  "str_quest_chat_15263005": "I don't think so...",
  "str_quest_chat_15263006": "Hmm. Is it because you haven't eaten anything this morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_15263007": "Right...",
  "str_quest_chat_15263008": "Basically.",

  "str_quest_chat_15563005": "Have a great afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_15581001": "Navigator, you know what? Going to bed late can cause harm to your internal organs, and lack of sleep affects your judgment and mood the following day. If you don't get it under control in time, you'll wind up stuck in an infinite vicious circle.",
  "str_quest_chat_15581002": "It will eventually make the body—",

  "str_quest_chat_15581004": "That's good.",
  "str_quest_chat_15582001": "Navigator, are you having a good day?",
  "str_quest_chat_15582002": "A little...",
  "str_quest_chat_15582003": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_15582004": "It's been a rather busy day for me...",
  "str_quest_chat_15582005": "It's fine! Just have a good sleep and be well rested!",

  "str_quest_chat_15641003": "It's only because I boarded this Colossus that I had to seriously consider potential escape routes. It pays to prepare!",
  "str_quest_chat_15641004": "If you think about it carefully, how else can we protect as many people as possible if the Colossus finds itself in a life-and-death situation?",
  "str_quest_chat_15641005": "The only way to do this is to evaluate the risks and train in advance. You know what that means—an escape drill!",
  "str_quest_chat_15641006": "So, where should we evacuate from the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_15641007": "First of all, it shouldn't be from up high. That wouldn't fly with the Aurorians who are afraid of heights.",
  "str_quest_chat_15641008": "Secondly, it's not safe to retreat from the sides, as this can cause crowding and eventual stampeding.",
  "str_quest_chat_15641009": "So the safest route is straight down!",
  "str_quest_chat_15641010": "Did you... dig a hole in the Colossus?",

  "str_quest_chat_15641012": "Well, that's alright then...",
  "str_quest_chat_15641013": "It's not a hole; it's an emergency exit!",
  "str_quest_chat_15641014": "I built three escape routes just in case, with three emergency exits leading from the Colossus—enough to ensure the safety of everyone!",

  "str_quest_chat_15662005": "Certainly. Do you have any idea what the problem might be?",

  "str_quest_chat_15662007": "Maybe they couldn't find your room?",
  "str_quest_chat_15662008": "Hmm... I think they probably lost it! My room's so easy to find!",
  "str_quest_chat_15662009": "It's the only room with a door covered with the latest optical camouflage technology!",
  "str_quest_chat_15662010": "And there are loads of junk and plants outside to hide the door!",

  "str_quest_chat_15663003": "What's the rush?",
  "str_quest_chat_15663004": "Please don't tell me you've bludgeoned a hole in the Colossus...",

  "str_quest_chat_15663016": "But I can't guarantee anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_15663017": "I dug out an escape tunnel under your bed, just in case.",
  "str_quest_chat_15663018": "Use it to evacuate from the Colossus in case of emergency!",
  "str_quest_chat_15663019": "Thanks... wait what?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15664001": "It's best to eat more veggies in the afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_15664002": "Are vegetables your go-to meal for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_15664003": "Yep.",
  "str_quest_chat_15664004": "But I take my veggies really seriously, no matter which meal it is.",
  "str_quest_chat_15664005": "When it comes to this, PlayerName should learn a thing or two from me!",
  "str_quest_chat_15664006": "Absolutely.",
  "str_quest_chat_15664007": "I'll do my best to eat more vegetables.",
  "str_quest_chat_15665001": "Knock, knock! PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_15665002": "I'm in!",
  "str_quest_chat_15665003": "I-I'm not in!",
  "str_quest_chat_15665004": "Don't lie to me! I know you're in!",
  "str_quest_chat_15665005": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_15665006": "To ensure you take in enough veggies, I made a special juice...",
  "str_quest_chat_15665007": "With every one of my favorite vegetables!",
  "str_quest_chat_15665008": "Thanks, that's very kind of you...",
  "str_quest_chat_15665009": "Wait, I got a question for you—",
  "str_quest_chat_15665010": "There's nothing weird in it, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_15665011": "Like diesel oil or chili powder.",
  "str_quest_chat_15665012": "No, why would it have that?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15666001": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_15666002": "Good afternoon, Rabbie.",
  "str_quest_chat_15666003": "PlayerName, let's make an evacuation plan!",
  "str_quest_chat_15666004": "Dig all the way from your room to the very bottom of Soroz...",
  "str_quest_chat_15666005": "Then...",
  "str_quest_chat_15666006": "Then, you'll probably be falling through the air.",
  "str_quest_chat_15666007": "Hmm... I guess things are different up here.",
  "str_quest_chat_15666008": "I'll make a new plan then.",
  "str_quest_chat_15666009": "Good luck!",
  "str_quest_chat_15667001": "PlayerName! I dug up something amazing recently!",
  "str_quest_chat_15667002": "It was like a box, covered with mud.",
  "str_quest_chat_15667003": "Inside, there was a strange film.",
  "str_quest_chat_15667004": "I heard that you have some movie screening gear, PlayerName, so I brought it here to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15667005": "Let's watch it together.",
  "str_quest_chat_15667006": "Okay, let's do it!",
  "str_quest_chat_15668001": "PlayerName! I need help!",
  "str_quest_chat_15668002": "Huh? What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_15668003": "I need a bigger, stronger drill!",
  "str_quest_chat_15668004": "Huh? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_15668005": "Because it's so hard to break through the ground around here!",
  "str_quest_chat_15668006": "For example, how am I supposed to break through the floors on Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_15668007": "Don't drill holes on Soroz!",
  "str_quest_chat_15669001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_15669002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_15669003": "Have you heard?",
  "str_quest_chat_15669004": "Heard what?",
  "str_quest_chat_15669005": "I heard that Illumina had invented a new kind of canned food.",
  "str_quest_chat_15669006": "... I'm not interested.",
  "str_quest_chat_15669007": "But, this is no ordinary canned food!",
  "str_quest_chat_15669008": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_15669009": "They say you can keep it for decades without it going bad!",
  "str_quest_chat_15669010": "It's the perfect product to hoard for desperate situations.",
  "str_quest_chat_15669011": "I'm thinking about filling all my hidden caves with the stuff, then I'll never have to worry about starving!",
  "str_quest_chat_15669012": "Okay... I'll ask Gram for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15669013": "Alright! Thank you so much!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701001": "To thank her eternally loyal fans, I have prepared a special handshake and signing event.",
  "str_quest_chat_15701002": "Come and join in!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701003": "Huh? A promo event? Sounds interesting...",
  "str_quest_chat_15701004": "It's a handshake and signing event.",
  "str_quest_chat_15701005": "All you need to do is buy my album and you can take part!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701006": "You'll get to shake Barbara's hand and get an exclusive autograph!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701007": "So, how can I take part?",
  "str_quest_chat_15701008": "All you need to do is buy my album and you can take part!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701009": "Just attend the handshake event and you can shake hands with Barbara!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701010": "As long as you have the album, you can get Barbara's autograph!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701011": "Wow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701012": "Besides, as a way to thank you for your gracious support, this handshake and signing event has been specially prepared for you, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701013": "So don't worry about there being too many people!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701014": "Wow!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701015": "So, come buy the album for a chance to take part!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701016": "All you need is 99,998 Nightium, and a unique exclusive show, specially prepared for PlayerName, will be waiting for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_15701017": "Wait... How much? I'm not sure I can afford that...",
  "str_quest_chat_15701999": "Go and look for him on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_15741001": "Hey! This is Barbara! The number one singing idol!",
  "str_quest_chat_15741002": "Bet you never expected that! A super-popular idol sending you a message! Feeling excited?",
  "str_quest_chat_15741003": "That's right! Barbara's shining support will always be here to inspire you with courage and hope. Hello, everyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_15741004": "H-Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_15741005": "Huh? Is that all you've got?",
  "str_quest_chat_15741006": "It seems the crowd needs warming up! Never mind! As a top idol, Barbara is simply the best at creating the ultimate party atmosphere!",
  "str_quest_chat_15741007": "So, let's get in the mood with an impromptu concert!",
  "str_quest_chat_15741008": "A concert? Right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_15741009": "You got it! The venue... Right on top of this Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_15741010": "On top?",
  "str_quest_chat_15741011": "Hey! You can't go up there! It's dangerous... You're going to fall!",
  "str_quest_chat_15741012": "Why would I fall? Super Pop Idol Barbara is never afraid to twirl through the air!",
  "str_quest_chat_15741013": "You're not afraid, but I am! Don't go up there!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742001": "Ta-dah! Here comes Barbara!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742002": "Today, the perfect idol becomes a super idol! One step closer to divine perfection!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742003": "For this, please accept Barbara's love ♥!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742004": "Ah? What a big heart!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742005": "That's right! An idol always gives her utmost love to her most loyal fans!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742006": "♥♥♥♥♥",
  "str_quest_chat_15742007": "PlayerName's love for Barbara will fill the entire Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742008": "But Barbara won't stop there!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742009": "♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡",
  "str_quest_chat_15742010": "Over the next few days, please listen to Barbara's song! With our hearts united, we can do anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742011": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742012": "Barbara... you're always so full of energy.",
  "str_quest_chat_15742013": "Of course! An idol should always bring boundless love and energy to her fans!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742014": "The reason for this energy? It's the love you all show for Barbara, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742015": "So Barbara will do whatever it takes to repay you with her singing!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742016": "I'm starting to feel a little pumped!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742017": "That's it! Let's get this party started!",
  "str_quest_chat_15742018": "Alright!",
  "str_quest_chat_15751001": "Morning, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_15751002": "Morning, Barbara. You're up early.",
  "str_quest_chat_15751003": "Hee-hee, a sensible work and rest schedule is a basic essential for every idol.",
  "str_quest_chat_15751004": "Wow... Idols are amazing.",
  "str_quest_chat_15752001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_15752002": "I'm so excited right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_15752003": "I mean, I'm so excited!",
  "str_quest_chat_15752004": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_15752005": "Just now, a marvelous melody of the burning desert suddenly erupted within my mind!",
  "str_quest_chat_15752006": "Congratulations.",
  "str_quest_chat_15752007": "So, come and help me compose it then!",
  "str_quest_chat_15752008": "Come on! There's no time to waste!",
  "str_quest_chat_15753001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_15753002": "I couldn't sleep last night. There's something I wanted to ask you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15753003": "Huh? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15753004": "What do you think of my singing?",
  "str_quest_chat_15753005": "It's great.",
  "str_quest_chat_15753006": "Am I better than Regina?",
  "str_quest_chat_15753007": "You're better!",
  "str_quest_chat_15753008": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_15753009": "I know you're probably just saying that, but I'm still very happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_15753010": "I won't give up! I'll practice harder and get even better than Regina!",
  "str_quest_chat_15753011": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_15753012": "Well, you don't need to say anything, I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_15753013": "But I, Barbara, the world's number one, won't give up!",
  "str_quest_chat_15753014": "I'll practice harder and surpass Regina!",
  "str_quest_chat_15753015": "Right! I'll be rooting for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15754001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_15754002": "Are you awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_15754003": "Yeah, I just woke up.",
  "str_quest_chat_15754004": "Great! Come and practice with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_15754005": "Huh? It's so early!",
  "str_quest_chat_15754006": "Yeah! It's not easy waking the others up at this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_15754007": "Even an idol should respect her friends' feelings.",
  "str_quest_chat_15754008": "Even the most soothing song isn't suitable in the middle of the night when people need to rest!",
  "str_quest_chat_15754009": "Bringing warmth and love to the world every morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_15754010": "That's me! Your adorable Barbara!",
  "str_quest_chat_15754011": "Do-re-mi-fa—",
  "str_quest_chat_15754012": "Alright, I'll be right there.",
  "str_quest_chat_15755001": "Sigh...",
  "str_quest_chat_15755002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_15755003": "I really want to eat some fish porridge this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_15755004": "Then why don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_15755005": "We're in the Rediesel Desert... It's not easy to get fish here.",
  "str_quest_chat_15755006": "Also, fish bones can get stuck in your throat.",
  "str_quest_chat_15755007": "Let me teach you how to spit them out.",
  "str_quest_chat_15755008": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_15755009": "Well... Maybe I'll eat some secretly.",
  "str_quest_chat_15755010": "Don't let your agent find out.",
  "str_quest_chat_15755011": "Thank you, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_15761001": "PlayerName, come and have lunch with me!",
  "str_quest_chat_15761002": "Oh... I've just eaten.",
  "str_quest_chat_15761003": "Hmm? Then eat again with your lovely idol Barbara!",
  "str_quest_chat_15761004": "Wait!?",
  "str_quest_chat_15761005": "Hee-hee, I'm just kidding!",
  "str_quest_chat_15762001": "Don't take a nap right after you have lunch, PlayerName; otherwise, you'll get fat!",
  "str_quest_chat_15762002": "Hmm. I'll try to remember that.",
  "str_quest_chat_15762003": "So, why don't you come and chat with me for a while?",
  "str_quest_chat_15762004": "Well, I guess I don't have anything else to do for the time being.",
  "str_quest_chat_15763001": "The Colossus certainly becomes lively around noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_15763002": "Well, I guess the night owls all get up around this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_15763003": "But it seems a little over the top, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_15763004": "What do you mean by that?",
  "str_quest_chat_15763005": "A Rediesel Wrench seems to be shouting about something with a bomb in the hand.",
  "str_quest_chat_15763006": "Oh... Please don't!",
  "str_quest_chat_15764001": "Hey, if it isn't my biggest fan! How's your afternoon going?",
  "str_quest_chat_15764002": "Fine, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_15764003": "But... when exactly did I become your biggest fan?",
  "str_quest_chat_15764004": "The person who has watched my star-studded career from its most humble beginnings...",
  "str_quest_chat_15764005": "That person has to be my number-one fan! Heehee!",
  "str_quest_chat_15764006": "You're not trying to get me to buy your new album... are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_15764007": "Oh, PlayerName... All I'm trying to do...",
  "str_quest_chat_15764008": "Is a priceless, one-of-a-kind greeting from your beloved idol!",
  "str_quest_chat_15764009": "How could you possibly doubt your idol's intentions?",
  "str_quest_chat_15764010": "Not that I really care, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_15764011": "The only thing the great Barbara wishes for, more than anything...",
  "str_quest_chat_15764012": "Is for PlayerName, to lead a long, happy, and healthy life!",
  "str_quest_chat_15764013": "Why do I suddenly feel so touched?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15765001": "My arms are so sore...",
  "str_quest_chat_15765002": "Take a rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_15765003": "I can't... I haven't finished today's work. Still 982 signatures to go...",
  "str_quest_chat_15765004": "What?! What are the signatures for?",
  "str_quest_chat_15765005": "For practice, of course! I need to have my signed name be cute and appealing! I can't slack off!",
  "str_quest_chat_15765006": "Right... Keep it up, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_15766001": "Hey, how are you doing? Make sure you get enough sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_15766002": "I'm doing fine I guess?",
  "str_quest_chat_15766003": "Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_15766004": "Hehe, this is a message I plan to give to my fans!",
  "str_quest_chat_15766005": "What do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_15766006": "That sounds so sweet.",
  "str_quest_chat_15766007": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_15766008": "Yes! To show my appreciation, I'll give you ten autographed albums right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_15766009": "There we go. Have a good afternoon, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_15766010": "Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_15766011": "...Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_15767001": "Do you want to become an idol with me, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_15767002": "With your talent, I'm sure you can become a superstar in the whole of Astra!",
  "str_quest_chat_15767003": "A-An idol?",
  "str_quest_chat_15767004": "N-no way...",
  "str_quest_chat_15767005": "I can't sing or dance...",
  "str_quest_chat_15767006": "No? Hmm, that's too bad.",
  "str_quest_chat_15767007": "I even got a name picked out for your fan club.",
  "str_quest_chat_15767008": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15767009": "The Barbara Beam Fan Club!",
  "str_quest_chat_15767010": "Why is your name included in my fan club name?",
  "str_quest_chat_15801001": "Navigator... Have you ever seen a caterpillar?",
  "str_quest_chat_15801002": "A caterpillar?",
  "str_quest_chat_15801003": "Yes, it's a kind of insect.",
  "str_quest_chat_15801004": "They're fat, soft, hairy, and dangerous...",
  "str_quest_chat_15801005": "Ah... It seems like a creature to avoid.",
  "str_quest_chat_15801006": "They're also delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat_15801007": "I beg your pardon?",
  "str_quest_chat_15801008": "If you like them...",
  "str_quest_chat_15801009": "I can give you one! It's fresh!",
  "str_quest_chat_15801010": "Do they taste good?",
  "str_quest_chat_15801011": "Yeah, especially when they're fresh.",
  "str_quest_chat_15801012": "One bite and you'll have juice dripping from your chin...",
  "str_quest_chat_15801013": "N-no way...",
  "str_quest_chat_15801014": "I won't be adding caterpillars to my culinary repertoire just yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_15801015": "R... Really? Sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat_15801016": "I thought you'd like them...",
  "str_quest_chat_15801017": "Huh? Don't leave in a bad mood...",
  "str_quest_chat_15801018": "I didn't want to hurt her feelings, but caterpillars are...",
  "str_quest_chat_15841001": "Hello... N-Nice to meet you...",
  "str_quest_chat_15841002": "Hello... I can tell how nervous you are from reading your words...",
  "str_quest_chat_15841003": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_15841004": "Vice says you like hiding in your coat...",
  "str_quest_chat_15841005": "Y-yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_15841006": "It's because I'm shy... and my tail is so big... and look at all these spikes on my hands...",
  "str_quest_chat_15841007": "It's alright.",
  "str_quest_chat_15841008": "Don't worry about that. Everyone aboard Soroz is very friendly.",
  "str_quest_chat_15841009": "Also, having such a fluffy tail is a good thing. It's not unusual.",
  "str_quest_chat_15841010": "We're all the same.",
  "str_quest_chat_15841011": "Everyone here may look a little different on the outside, but it's not that difficult to get used to.",
  "str_quest_chat_15841012": "So no matter whether you have a tail or not, you can still make good friends with everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat_15841013": "That's great...",
  "str_quest_chat_15841014": "So... Will everyone like my bomb, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_15841015": "Your bomb!?",
  "str_quest_chat_15841016": "Yeah... When I get excited, I like to throw bombs around...",
  "str_quest_chat_15841017": "If you like bombs, too... That would be better...",
  "str_quest_chat_15841018": "I think you'll be able to make like-minded friends on Soroz...",
  "str_quest_chat_15851001": "Good morning, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_15851002": "Good morning, Maggie. You seem to be in good spirits today.",
  "str_quest_chat_15851003": "I'm going out for my morning exercise. Would you like to join me, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_15851004": "Well... This is a rare opportunity. I'll go.",
  "str_quest_chat_15851005": "Oh! I'm all fired up!",
  "str_quest_chat_15852001": "Good morning! Got a minute?",
  "str_quest_chat_15852002": "Good morning, Maggie! What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15852003": "When I woke up, my tail got caught in the space between my bed and the headboard...",
  "str_quest_chat_15852004": "I almost couldn't get it out!",
  "str_quest_chat_15852005": "Oh, no! Are you okay? Do you need any help?",
  "str_quest_chat_15852006": "Heehee, I've already taken care of it...",
  "str_quest_chat_15852007": "By blowing up my bed! Granted, I nearly blew off my tail in the process...",
  "str_quest_chat_15852008": "W... What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15853001": "Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_15853002": "W-What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_15853003": "Don't tell me you blew something up again?",
  "str_quest_chat_15853004": "I was just about to ask you the same thing!",

  "str_quest_chat_15854005": "Yes, Vice cooked a wonderful breakfast made of canned food.",

  "str_quest_chat_15855001": "Yawn—I'm so sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_15855002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_15855003": "It felt like there was something wrong with my bike yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat_15855004": "So, I spent all night checking it...",
  "str_quest_chat_15855005": "Did you find out what the problem was?",
  "str_quest_chat_15855006": "Yeah... But I need to go to Umbraton to find new parts.",
  "str_quest_chat_15855007": "I see. Get some rest first, Maggie.",
  "str_quest_chat_15855008": "I'll go buy them for you.",

  "str_quest_chat_15856013": "It just looks like a grenade...",
  "str_quest_chat_15856014": "It's chocolate.",
  "str_quest_chat_15856015": "Oh... It's chocolate.",
  "str_quest_chat_15856016": "You scared me. It's really realistic.",
  "str_quest_chat_15856017": "Heehee! Do you like it?",

  "str_quest_chat_15856019": "Good.",
  "str_quest_chat_15863001": "Good afternoon, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_15863002": "I wanted to apologize...",
  "str_quest_chat_15863003": "I have a habit of getting too excited and tossing bombs everywhere.",
  "str_quest_chat_15863004": "I hope I didn't cause you much trouble...",
  "str_quest_chat_15863005": "So that's what this is about...",
  "str_quest_chat_15863006": "I'm still alive, at least.",
  "str_quest_chat_15863007": "At least I can still afford Soroz's repairs.",
  "str_quest_chat_15863008": "So, it shouldn't matter for the time being...",

  "str_quest_chat_15864005": "Huh? Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_15864006": "That's awesome!",
  "str_quest_chat_15864007": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_15864008": "Tiny One said that as long as someone likes motorbikes, they can't be bad.",
  "str_quest_chat_15864009": "Hmm... That's kind of an inane thing to say, but I suppose I'm not a bad person.",
  "str_quest_chat_15864010": "Heehee! Let's go for a ride sometime.",
  "str_quest_chat_15864011": "Okay.",

  "str_quest_chat_15865005": "But... today's not my birthday.",
  "str_quest_chat_15865006": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_15865007": "Oh! I misread the date!",
  "str_quest_chat_15865008": "I'm sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat_15865009": "I'm dreadfully, dreadfully sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat_15865010": "It's alright, we can still go for a ride together.",
  "str_quest_chat_15865011": "Really? What a great idea!",
  "str_quest_chat_15866001": "PlayerName, I've got an idea all of a sudden.",
  "str_quest_chat_15866002": "Huh? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15866003": "You need to get in shape, right, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_15866004": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_15866005": "But that's not the point!",
  "str_quest_chat_15866006": "I've thought of a way to help you exercise and build a stronger body!",
  "str_quest_chat_15866007": "Hmm? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15866008": "This sounds interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_15866009": "Just run behind my motorbike!",
  "str_quest_chat_15866010": "Erm... Forget it.",
  "str_quest_chat_15866011": "It sounds exhausting.",
  "str_quest_chat_15866012": "Then, how about riding a bicycle?",
  "str_quest_chat_15866013": "Hmm... that sounds reasonable.",
  "str_quest_chat_15866014": "I'll give it a try the next time I have a chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_15881001": "Wanna play? I'm pumped up right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_15881002": "Afternoon, Maggie... I'm a little tired...",
  "str_quest_chat_15881003": "You really don't wanna play with me...?",
  "str_quest_chat_15881004": "Sorry... Maybe next time? I need some rest right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_15881005": "Ah... What a bummer...",
  "str_quest_chat_15881006": "But I'll go get them right now... Don't worry about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_15881007": "... Wait, what grenades?! What have you done?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15881008": "W-Well, I thought you were gonna play with me... So I left a few grenades earlier...",
  "str_quest_chat_15881009": "But I'll go get them away right now... Don't worry about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_15881010": "... Make it quick! The faster, the better!",
  "str_quest_chat_15882001": "Good afternoon! Getting ready to take a break?",
  "str_quest_chat_15882002": "Good afternoon. Yeah, I just laid down to take a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_15882003": "Do you mean your bed doesn't feel any different? Like there's something else on it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15882004": "...W-What?",
  "str_quest_chat_15882005": "It's the middle of the day! I'm not going to freak out!",
  "str_quest_chat_15882006": "I left some cute tiny beetles on your bed earlier. I figured they'd be perfect cuddle buddies for your naps!",
  "str_quest_chat_15882007": "That is NOT okay!!",
  "str_quest_chat_15882008": "You sound so scared... But there's nothing scary about bugs, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_15882009": "Oh... I guess some people really don't like bugs, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_15882010": "Oh, c'mon, that was a prank! I would never walk into someone's room like that!",
  "str_quest_chat_15882011": "That's a relief... Except...",
  "str_quest_chat_15882012": "Why does my body still feel itchy all over?!",
  "str_quest_chat_15901001": "Navigator, I remember what you said last time. Want to hear my story?",
  "str_quest_chat_15901002": "Yeah, you had an emergency to deal with, so you didn't have time to tell me.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901003": "Okay. Let's talk about me, and... him.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901004": "Him?",
  "str_quest_chat_15901005": "My father. He taught me, saved me, and made me who I am today.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901006": "But... Forget it.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901007": "Let's not talk about him.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901008": "Erm... Do you want to talk about it or not?",
  "str_quest_chat_15901009": "It's okay. It's my problem, so I need to face it on my own.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901010": "Sorry to ruin your mood.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901011": "Well, if you don't want to talk about it, don't worry...",
  "str_quest_chat_15901012": "Thanks for understanding, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901013": "But... I'm still a little concerned.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901014": "I feel like we have unfinished business.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901015": "Alright. No matter what happened in the past, you are now a remarkable person, Irridon.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901016": "Your father would be proud of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15901017": "... Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15941001": "Hello, Navigator of the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_15941002": "Although I am the chief judge of Lumopolis, I want to ask you something for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_15941003": "Huh? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15941004": "Are there any particular \"rules\" or anything like that on your Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_15941005": "Of course, there are!",
  "str_quest_chat_15941006": "For example, something like \"May everyone spend everyday joyfully.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_15941007": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_15941008": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_15941009": "If there were... It'd be that everyone must be happy every day!",
  "str_quest_chat_15941010": "Other than that, there are no rules.",
  "str_quest_chat_15941011": "That's not what I mean.",
  "str_quest_chat_15941012": "I am speaking of rules that require judicial hearings. Such as theft, breaking into other people's rooms, entering prohibited areas... that kind of thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_15941013": "As the presiding chief judge, I will adjudicate those who violate the rules in return for you inviting me to the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_15941014": "I don't think we'll be introducing any rules like this...",
  "str_quest_chat_15941015": "It's not that strict here.",
  "str_quest_chat_15941016": "Oh... That's quite different from what I'm used to.",
  "str_quest_chat_15941017": "It's so different from Lumopolis. I'll try to observe how things work here a little more closely.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942001": "Navigator, I want to hear what you think of me.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942002": "What I... think of you?",
  "str_quest_chat_15942003": "You're amazing.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942004": "Amazing...?",
  "str_quest_chat_15942005": "You're hard-working.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942006": "Hard-working...?",
  "str_quest_chat_15942007": "Irridon, you are the Chief Judge of Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942008": "So, of course, you're an amazing, hard-working, and serious person.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942009": "You constantly improve your strength and never slack off for a moment.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942010": "Though... having to take on so many trials every day... It must be tough.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942011": "I'm not good enough... and I don't think I work that hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942012": "This is the path I have chosen, and I will take responsibility for it until the end.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942013": "It's just... Sometimes, I do feel tired.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942014": "Well, it's alright to take a break once in a while.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942015": "No, the deadliest blade requires constant sharpening. I can't become complacent.",
  "str_quest_chat_15942016": "If I grow stronger, that'll make me happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_15951001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_15951002": "Hope I didn't disturb you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15951003": "It's all right. I'm awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_15951004": "But I'm still a bit sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_15951005": "Your mental state in the morning can affect the entire day's work and activities.",
  "str_quest_chat_15951006": "If you still feel sleepy, it may be a good choice to wash your face with cold water.",
  "str_quest_chat_15951007": "Cold water can wake you up quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_15951008": "I'll give it a try!",
  "str_quest_chat_15951009": "Thanks for the tip, Irridon!",
  "str_quest_chat_15951010": "You're very welcome. It's just something I've learned through experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_15961001": "Did you have lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_15961002": "Yeah, I've just finished.",
  "str_quest_chat_15961003": "If you're tired, take a nap. Don't let yourself get too tired.",
  "str_quest_chat_15961004": "Alright, I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_15962001": "Good afternoon. Lunch break is over.",
  "str_quest_chat_15962002": "*Yawn* Good afternoon, Irridon...",
  "str_quest_chat_15962003": "Did you just wake up?",
  "str_quest_chat_15962004": "Mm-hmm... I'm still pretty sleepy!",
  "str_quest_chat_15962005": "You should do a few stretches to alleviate your fatigue.",
  "str_quest_chat_15962006": "Sure... I'll give it a try. Thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_15962007": "You're welcome. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_15963001": "I hope I'm not interrupting?",
  "str_quest_chat_15963002": "Not at all! What's up, Irridon?",
  "str_quest_chat_15963003": "Nothing terribly important, really...",
  "str_quest_chat_15963004": "I just thought talking to you after a long day of work would be a nice way to unwind.",
  "str_quest_chat_15963005": "Oh... In that case, want me to tell a joke?",
  "str_quest_chat_15963006": "That won't be necessary. Talking to someone who isn't constrained by orders always helps me relax.",
  "str_quest_chat_15963007": "Now then, I'll be leaving now. Enjoy your afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_15963008": "But we didn't really talk at all... Have a nice day!",
  "str_quest_chat_15964001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_15964002": "Good afternoon, Irridon.",
  "str_quest_chat_15964003": "Have you finished all your morning tasks?",
  "str_quest_chat_15964004": "I did, although I did run a little late. I'm still in time for lunch though.",
  "str_quest_chat_15964005": "You always work so hard, Irridon.",
  "str_quest_chat_15964006": "Well, I can't deny it can be tricky.",
  "str_quest_chat_15964007": "But I'll never regret working to bring justice to Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_15965001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_15965002": "Hi.",
  "str_quest_chat_15965003": "Are you familiar with the legal concept of the \"right to remain silent\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_15965004": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_15965005": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_15965006": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_15965007": "PlayerName? Are you listening to me?",
  "str_quest_chat_15965008": "I'm exercising my right to remain silent.",
  "str_quest_chat_15965009": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_15965010": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_15965011": "I'm talking to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_15965012": "S-Sorry! I was just kidding!",
  "str_quest_chat_15966001": "PlayerName, I need your help with something.",
  "str_quest_chat_15966002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15966003": "A speeding train is out of control and is approaching a fork in the tracks.",
  "str_quest_chat_15966004": "One path may cause one person to be injured.",
  "str_quest_chat_15966005": "The other path may cause several people to be injured.",
  "str_quest_chat_15966006": "It's up to you to decide which path the train takes.",
  "str_quest_chat_15966007": "Which will you choose?",
  "str_quest_chat_15966008": "I... I'm afraid I can't choose.",
  "str_quest_chat_15966009": "It's very noble to sacrifice yourself for the sake of others in a crisis.",
  "str_quest_chat_15966010": "But that doesn't mean you can choose to save certain people at the expense of others.",
  "str_quest_chat_15966011": "... Yes. That makes sense.",
  "str_quest_chat_15966012": "You have my thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_15967001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_15967002": "Hi.",
  "str_quest_chat_15967003": "I just had lunch. Have you had yours?",
  "str_quest_chat_15967004": "I've just eaten.",
  "str_quest_chat_15967005": "Vice made it for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_15967006": "Oh? Vice?",
  "str_quest_chat_15967007": "Did you choose what you wanted her to make for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_15967008": "Hmm... I usually just eat whatever Vice makes.",
  "str_quest_chat_15967009": "Huh? You don't choose what you want to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_15967010": "No... I usually eat whatever I'm given. I'm not too picky.",
  "str_quest_chat_15967011": "It's not about pickiness. Choosing what you want to eat is simply you exercising your free will.",
  "str_quest_chat_15967012": "Wait a moment, I need to check the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_15967013": "I'll show you around Lumopolis in the afternoon to teach you how to choose your favorite dishes.",
  "str_quest_chat_15967014": "O-Okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_15981001": "Are you planning on studying all night?",
  "str_quest_chat_15981002": "No, but I'm not very sleepy right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_15981003": "If you start to feel sleepy, you can go to bed later... It's just like drinking water when you're thirsty. Understand?",
  "str_quest_chat_15981004": "I... I understand. I'm going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_15982001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_15982002": "Good evening, Irridon.",
  "str_quest_chat_15982003": "It's late... Are you planning to go to bed anytime soon?",
  "str_quest_chat_15982004": "Yeah, but... I still haven't finished my work for the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_15982005": "Are you trying to persuade me into going to sleep earlier?",
  "str_quest_chat_15982006": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_15982007": "That's... unexpected.",
  "str_quest_chat_15982008": "I expected you to be a little more... strict?",
  "str_quest_chat_15982009": "This doesn't require me to be strict. I just feel like relaxing a bit before bed is good for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_15982010": "Relaxing...?",
  "str_quest_chat_15982011": "Yes. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_15982012": "Good night, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_15982013": "Er... Good night, Irridon!",
  "str_quest_chat_15983001": "It's raining tonight, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_15983002": "So it is... Good evening, Irridon.",
  "str_quest_chat_15983003": "The sound of rain always makes me sleep better.",
  "str_quest_chat_15983004": "Leaving your window open before bed might suit you as well, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_15983005": "Sure, thanks for the idea, Irridon.",
  "str_quest_chat_15983006": "You're welcome. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_15983007": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_15984001": "PlayerName, what do you think the point of having rules is?",
  "str_quest_chat_15984002": "To maintain self-discipline?",
  "str_quest_chat_15984003": "If I don't have a plan for the day, I lose all sense of discipline.",
  "str_quest_chat_15984004": "I'll be late and put things off.",
  "str_quest_chat_15984005": "Yes, rules provide order.",
  "str_quest_chat_15984006": "To keep everyone in line?",
  "str_quest_chat_15984007": "If we don't have rules to say who can do what...",
  "str_quest_chat_15984008": "We could end up causing problems for others.",
  "str_quest_chat_15984009": "For example, Barbara and Regina love to have singing competitions whenever they feel like it.",
  "str_quest_chat_15984010": "Even in the middle of the night.",
  "str_quest_chat_15984011": "That would be annoying...",

  "str_quest_chat_15984013": "Thanks for your answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_15985001": "Are you asleep, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_15985002": "I'm still awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_15985003": "You're not asleep yet, Irridon?",
  "str_quest_chat_15985004": "Right... I still have some work matters to attend to.",
  "str_quest_chat_15985005": "Is there anything I can do to help you?",
  "str_quest_chat_15985006": "That won't be necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat_15985007": "It's not that I don't need your help.",
  "str_quest_chat_15985008": "It's just that this is my responsibility. I should not rely on the help of others.",
  "str_quest_chat_15985009": "Though I still appreciate it, nevertheless.",
  "str_quest_chat_15985010": "Well... There's no need to stand on ceremony.",
  "str_quest_chat_15985011": "If you need anything, like a cup of hot coffee or hot milk, I can still help out.",
  "str_quest_chat_15985012": "... Haha... After hearing you say that, I suddenly feel like having a drink.",
  "str_quest_chat_15985013": "So, how about some hot milk?",
  "str_quest_chat_15985014": "Sure. Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_15986001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_15986002": "Hmm?",
  "str_quest_chat_15986003": "Still not asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_15986004": "Right. I suddenly thought of asking you something.",
  "str_quest_chat_15986005": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_15986006": "Are you afraid of the dark?",
  "str_quest_chat_15986007": "... Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_15986008": "So... You want to \"let me light up this place\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_15986009": "*Coughs*",
  "str_quest_chat_15986010": "I wasn't joking.",
  "str_quest_chat_15986011": "Do you feel like there's always something flickering in the dark?",
  "str_quest_chat_15986012": "That's probably just the fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat_15986013": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_15986014": "Don't stay up too late.",
  "str_quest_chat_15986015": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_15987001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_15987002": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_15987003": "My legs feel... quite sore today.",
  "str_quest_chat_15987004": "Huh? What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_15987005": "Do you need help?",
  "str_quest_chat_15987006": "Should I take you back to Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_15987007": "No, that won't be necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat_15987008": "Calm down.",
  "str_quest_chat_15987009": "It just happens sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat_15987010": "Perhaps there are some minor problems with the seams of my Threads of Lightning.",
  "str_quest_chat_15987011": "Have you been too busy with work recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_15987012": "Hmm... Now that you mention it, perhaps I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_15987013": "Rest early today.",
  "str_quest_chat_15987014": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_16001001": "Navigator, do you know anything about meditation?",
  "str_quest_chat_16001002": "Meditation?",
  "str_quest_chat_16001003": "Yes. In a quiet place, you close your eyes and meditate in silence.",
  "str_quest_chat_16001004": "This kind of thing... I've been in Soroz for 17 years. I was basically doing that the whole time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16001005": "I see. You look so young but you are a master of meditation.",
  "str_quest_chat_16001006": "You can't judge a book by its cover.",
  "str_quest_chat_16001007": "Maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding here...",
  "str_quest_chat_16001008": "So, you might just be Reinhardt's biggest challenger.",
  "str_quest_chat_16001009": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_16001010": "Ha-ha-ha... Very good, another challenger. Things become very interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_16001011": "Challenger? What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_16001012": "I mean, you're now a literal challenger, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16001013": "Erm... I'm not going to challenge Reinhardt...",
  "str_quest_chat_16001014": "I never thought of it like that...",
  "str_quest_chat_16001015": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_16001016": "Really.",
  "str_quest_chat_16001017": "You won't admit it? Never mind. But remember, I'm the only one who can challenge Reinhardt.",
  "str_quest_chat_16001018": "So, if you want to stake your challenge, you'll have to beat me first!",
  "str_quest_chat_16001019": "Hey, this is not what you think!",
  "str_quest_chat_16041001": "Hey, is this Colossus yours?",
  "str_quest_chat_16041002": "It's mine. He's called Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_16041003": "It's so cool. How much would it cost to rent it out?",
  "str_quest_chat_16041004": "Rent? Sorry, Soroz is not for rent.",
  "str_quest_chat_16041005": "Hmm... I suppose that means I can't borrow your Colossus from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16041006": "That's such a random thing to say... Is there something you need help with?",
  "str_quest_chat_16041007": "I'm thinking of establishing an air force.",
  "str_quest_chat_16041008": "Air force?",
  "str_quest_chat_16041009": "Right. If such a huge flying machine were to be used in aerial combat...",
  "str_quest_chat_16041010": "But Soroz isn't a combat model.",
  "str_quest_chat_16041011": "Hmm... Useless.",
  "str_quest_chat_16041012": "Does it need to be a \"combat model\" to go into battle?",
  "str_quest_chat_16041013": "Even if it's just a logistics or transportation model...",
  "str_quest_chat_16041014": "Anyway, you wouldn't understand. If you don't want to rent it out, that's fine too.",
  "str_quest_chat_16041015": "Huh? Why did you lose interest suddenly?",
  "str_quest_chat_16041016": "Hello? Are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_16042001": "Let's talk.",
  "str_quest_chat_16042002": "PlayerName, would you be interested in becoming my deputy?",
  "str_quest_chat_16042003": "Deputy?",
  "str_quest_chat_16042004": "Yes. After I become Illumina's Grand Marshal, you'll have the chance to be my deputy.",
  "str_quest_chat_16042005": "Huh? There's going to be a new Illumina Grand Marshal?",
  "str_quest_chat_16042006": "No... It's still Reinhardt.",
  "str_quest_chat_16042007": "But the future is uncertain.",
  "str_quest_chat_16042008": "As long as I become stronger, I'll surpass Reinhardt...",
  "str_quest_chat_16042009": "Soon... Soon, I will be the Grand Marshal.",
  "str_quest_chat_16042010": "At that time, I will need a deputy... and you are the most suitable candidate.",
  "str_quest_chat_16042011": "Me?...",
  "str_quest_chat_16042012": "I didn't plan on joining Illumina and becoming a Deputy Marshal...",
  "str_quest_chat_16042013": "Also... do you think I'm a good fit for the job?",
  "str_quest_chat_16042014": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_16042015": "As long as you possess this huge war machine, you're certainly the best choice for my Deputy Marshal.",
  "str_quest_chat_16042016": "Hey! Are you still thinking about using Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_16061001": "If you copy, please respond.",
  "str_quest_chat_16061002": "I-I copy! I copy!",
  "str_quest_chat_16061003": "Good.",
  "str_quest_chat_16061004": "You're not rest in lunch break, is anything wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_16061005": "Nope. Just testing your response time while you're on break, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat_16061006": "After all, you're in charge of so many lives, you need to be ready for an emergency at any given time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16061007": "You met my expectations, well done. I'll disturb no more.",
  "str_quest_chat_16061008": "S-So that's what it was...",
  "str_quest_chat_16062001": "Lunch breaks are a perfect time to do some meditation.",
  "str_quest_chat_16062002": "Yeah... Sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_16062003": "You still look pretty tired. Your work will be negatively affected, at this rate.",
  "str_quest_chat_16062004": "Well, you seem pretty energetic...",
  "str_quest_chat_16062005": "Does meditation... really help people relieve their stress?",
  "str_quest_chat_16062006": "Absolutely, as long as you master the proper meditation techniques.",
  "str_quest_chat_16062007": "When countless thoughts are flying through your mind, meditation is a great way to sort them out while also relieving stress.",
  "str_quest_chat_16062008": "I had no idea...",
  "str_quest_chat_16062009": "No wonder so many incredible people enjoy meditation.",
  "str_quest_chat_16062010": "Naturally! It also helps me draw even closer to my goals.",
  "str_quest_chat_16062011": "Surely, I'll give meditation a try next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_16062012": "Sure, goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat_16063001": "Full of energy and in good spirits.",
  "str_quest_chat_16063002": "I'm in my prime form!",
  "str_quest_chat_16063003": "What can I help you with?",
  "str_quest_chat_16063004": "Yawn—",
  "str_quest_chat_16063005": "Aren't you tired, Wrath?",
  "str_quest_chat_16063006": "What are you talking about, it's still so early!",
  "str_quest_chat_16063007": "How can you beat Reinhardt properly when you get tired so easily?",
  "str_quest_chat_16063008": "But it's noon...",
  "str_quest_chat_16063009": "And noon, means naptime...",
  "str_quest_chat_16063010": "Oh, sorry, I zoned out for a second.",
  "str_quest_chat_16063011": "We're on a mission, sleeping is prohibited!",
  "str_quest_chat_16063012": "My Red Baron and I are both waiting.",
  "str_quest_chat_16063013": "Well then... why don't I meditate for two hours first?",
  "str_quest_chat_16063014": "After two hours, let's...",
  "str_quest_chat_16063015": "PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_16063016": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_16063017": "Asleep again?",
  "str_quest_chat_16063018": "Never mind, I'll just do meditation to cultivate my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_16064001": "PlayerName, join the Guard Legion!",
  "str_quest_chat_16064002": "That's exactly what Barton said!",
  "str_quest_chat_16064003": "Well, someone with your abilities is bound to be popular.",
  "str_quest_chat_16064004": "Join us! I promise that, at the very least, the food is better than what you'd get with Barton.",
  "str_quest_chat_16064005": "Maybe some other time...",
  "str_quest_chat_16064006": "I'd rather stay on Soroz!",
  "str_quest_chat_16065001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16065002": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16065003": "PlayerName, have you been training with Vice recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_16065004": "No...",
  "str_quest_chat_16065005": "I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16065006": "No wonder you've been with Vice for so long but you're still so weak.",
  "str_quest_chat_16065007": "Let me think.",
  "str_quest_chat_16065008": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16065009": "Well, that settles it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16065010": "I'm going to train you today.",

  "str_quest_chat_16066008": "Everyone is extremely content.",
  "str_quest_chat_16066009": "Food and drink rations are also more than sufficient.",
  "str_quest_chat_16066010": "Oh, not bad! Not bad at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_16066011": "I'm satisfied.",
  "str_quest_chat_16066012": "Well done. Keep patrolling, soldier!",

  "str_quest_chat_16067006": "Sandworms?",
  "str_quest_chat_16067007": "That's a reasonable suggestion. I'll tell the head of the logistics department.",

  "str_quest_chat_16083004": "You were training this late at night?",

  "str_quest_chat_16142004": "It's nothing special, though.",
  "str_quest_chat_16142005": "It's just... Do we have any records of our strength enhancements?",
  "str_quest_chat_16142006": "Well... Records...",
  "str_quest_chat_16142007": "I don't think we do.",
  "str_quest_chat_16142008": "Do you need me to write you out a copy?",
  "str_quest_chat_16142009": "What...? Do you need a file? Do you want to submit it to Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_16142010": "No, I'm just... curious.",
  "str_quest_chat_16142011": "Curious?",
  "str_quest_chat_16142012": "Yes, I want a copy to add to my collection.",
  "str_quest_chat_16142013": "To add to your collection...? Wait, Michael, do you mean...",
  "str_quest_chat_16142014": "All the leaflets, old machine parts, old teddy bears, and Eclipsite corpses in your room you've collected from who knows where?",
  "str_quest_chat_16142015": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_16142016": "Well... Since it's for your collection, I'll ask Vice to write out a file and send it to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16142017": "Also, about the Eclipsite corpses... Don't keep them in Soroz!",
  "str_quest_chat_16151001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_16151002": "Good morning, Michael.",
  "str_quest_chat_16151003": "Breakfast was pretty good today.",
  "str_quest_chat_16151004": "Huh? Hmm... Why did it take two hours to say that?",
  "str_quest_chat_16152001": "Thunder... Did you hear that?",
  "str_quest_chat_16152002": "Yes, that was thunder. It'll probably rain today.",
  "str_quest_chat_16152003": "Do you need me to fight back with the thunder?",
  "str_quest_chat_16152004": "No, no, no! Why would you say that!?",
  "str_quest_chat_16153001": "Good morning. Your Colossus is really something, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_16153002": "Morning, Michael. What do you mean by that?",
  "str_quest_chat_16153003": "These little guys, flying all over the place... They're really fun to play with.",
  "str_quest_chat_16153004": "Wait, you don't mean...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16153005": "I grabbed one of them, and the rest of them started buzzing and flying all around me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16153006": "You added a Firefly to your collection?",
  "str_quest_chat_16153007": "That's right. A perfect start to a happy morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_16153008": "Well, it looks like there's no helping that poor Firefly now...",
  "str_quest_chat_16154001": "The sun's up.",
  "str_quest_chat_16154002": "Are you watching the sunrise, Michael?",
  "str_quest_chat_16154003": "No. I'm listening to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16154004": "What? Does the sunrise make any noise?",
  "str_quest_chat_16154005": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_16154006": "But I can hear the dew settling. And those sounds of cooking coming from the kitchen.",
  "str_quest_chat_16154007": "Oh. I wonder who's making breakfast today.",
  "str_quest_chat_16154008": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_16154009": "Now, I can hear Vice shout in the kitchen.",
  "str_quest_chat_16154010": "She is shouting, \"Why's that pot on fire!?\"",
  "str_quest_chat_16154011": "Huh!?",
  "str_quest_chat_16155001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_16155002": "Huh? Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_16155003": "Lightning... Wake up!",
  "str_quest_chat_16155004": "... Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16155005": "G-Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_16155006": "Did... you say \"good morning\" just now?",
  "str_quest_chat_16155007": "Right...",
  "str_quest_chat_16155008": "Oh... cool.",
  "str_quest_chat_16155009": "Uh, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_16155010": "Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_16156001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_16156002": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_16156003": "Wake up...",
  "str_quest_chat_16156004": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16156005": "Oh, Michael... Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_16156006": "This is odd...",
  "str_quest_chat_16156007": "Why did you send me a message?",
  "str_quest_chat_16156008": "Because I accidentally... took your alarm clock apart.",
  "str_quest_chat_16156009": "So... I'm doing your alarm clock's job.",
  "str_quest_chat_16156010": "R-Really? Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_16157001": "Good morning, yawn—",
  "str_quest_chat_16157002": "Good morning. You didn't sleep well?",
  "str_quest_chat_16157003": "Right...",
  "str_quest_chat_16157004": "I suddenly thought of my leaf collection.",
  "str_quest_chat_16157005": "It seems that there are two in particular...",
  "str_quest_chat_16157006": "They're very similar...",
  "str_quest_chat_16157007": "So, I searched for them all night...",
  "str_quest_chat_16157008": "Ah... But there are no two identical leaves in the world, are there?",
  "str_quest_chat_16157009": "Right... So, that's why I had to search.",
  "str_quest_chat_16157010": "Let me help you find them.",
  "str_quest_chat_16157011": "All right... Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_16181001": "It's late... You need to rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_16181002": "Hmm, thank you. I'll go to bed when I finish what I'm working on.",
  "str_quest_chat_16181003": "If you don't sleep, tomorrow, I will...",
  "str_quest_chat_16181004": "You will what? Don't just drop off halfway through a sentence! It's infuriating!",
  "str_quest_chat_16182001": "Planning on going to bed soon?",
  "str_quest_chat_16182002": "In a few minutes.",
  "str_quest_chat_16182003": "Yeah, right now actually.",
  "str_quest_chat_16182004": "Since you're still on the job, can I ask you something? Where do you keep the cleaning supplies on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_16182005": "...Cleaning supplies?",
  "str_quest_chat_16182006": "Why would you ask that late at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_16182007": "There are some water stains in the hallway, but I don't see the Fireflies taking care of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16182008": "I have no idea who dripped water all over, but the mess is making it impossible for me to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_16182009": "So... you want to clean it up yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_16182010": "Correct. The spots are about the size of a person's hand. Just tell me where the supplies are, and I'll handle it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16182011": "I-It's okay, let the Fireflies take care of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16182012": "It's possible they haven't detected the mess yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_16182013": "In that case, I'll just use my clothes to mop it up.",
  "str_quest_chat_16182014": "W-Wait! I'll call the Fireflies! Right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_16183001": "It's late... Do you ever have insomnia?",
  "str_quest_chat_16183002": "Good evening, Michael...",
  "str_quest_chat_16183003": "No, I usually sleep just fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_16183004": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_16183005": "What's the matter? Can't sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_16183006": "Mmm. I'm still thinking about things.",
  "str_quest_chat_16183007": "Nothing too troublesome, I hope?",
  "str_quest_chat_16183008": "No, I just can't remember where I put that leaf I collected before.",
  "str_quest_chat_16183009": "Losing sleep over a leaf...",
  "str_quest_chat_16183010": "That sounds a lot like you, Michael.",
  "str_quest_chat_16184001": "It's getting late.",
  "str_quest_chat_16184002": "Yeah, I'm going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_16184003": "What about you, Michael?",
  "str_quest_chat_16184004": "I need to sort out the warehouse before going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_16184005": "That's very meticulous of you...",
  "str_quest_chat_16184006": "By the way, what did you put in the warehouse?",
  "str_quest_chat_16184007": "Teddy bears, easels, glass beads...",
  "str_quest_chat_16184008": "I didn't know you enjoyed those things.",
  "str_quest_chat_16184009": "Communication terminals, street lamps, metal explosion-proof doors...",
  "str_quest_chat_16184010": "Huh...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16184011": "Soldering irons, car engines... and a railway carriage.",
  "str_quest_chat_16184012": "I finally understand...",
  "str_quest_chat_16184013": "Understand what?",
  "str_quest_chat_16184014": "Why Soroz has slowed down!",
  "str_quest_chat_16185001": "You've missed bedtime.",
  "str_quest_chat_16185002": "S-Sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat_16185003": "I was playing games and lost track of time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16185004": "It won't happen again!",
  "str_quest_chat_16185005": "I was busy working and lost track of time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16185006": "I didn't mean to!",
  "str_quest_chat_16185007": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_16185008": "Do you have anything else to say?",
  "str_quest_chat_16185009": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_16185010": "Don't be like that. I'm going to bed right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_16185011": "You've got five minutes!",
  "str_quest_chat_16185012": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_16186001": "Heheheh...",
  "str_quest_chat_16186002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16186003": "Heheheheh...",
  "str_quest_chat_16186004": "A-Are you okay, Michael?",
  "str_quest_chat_16186005": "Night has fallen...",
  "str_quest_chat_16186006": "Right... It's getting dark.",
  "str_quest_chat_16186007": "Let me see... Who's pretending to sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_16186008": "Still answering messages—!",
  "str_quest_chat_16186009": "!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_16186010": "Goodnight!",
  "str_quest_chat_16187001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_16187002": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_16187003": "Are you sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_16187004": "I'm sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_16187005": "No, you're not sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_16187006": "I'm sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_16187007": "If you're sleeping, how can you send messages?",
  "str_quest_chat_16187008": "This is an automatic reply.",
  "str_quest_chat_16187009": "Oh... An automatic reply.",
  "str_quest_chat_16187010": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_16187011": "Well, it's good that you're sleeping. Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201001": "Do you like rock music?",
  "str_quest_chat_16201002": "Yes, I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201003": "You like it? You've heard it before?",
  "str_quest_chat_16201004": "Yeah. But it's a little noisy...",
  "str_quest_chat_16201005": "Rock music... I know a little bit about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201006": "I know a little bit about it. It's kind of noisy...",
  "str_quest_chat_16201007": "Right, but after listening to it for a long time, you'll find it quite relaxing.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201008": "It's the first time I've heard anyone say \"you'll find it quite relaxing\" about rock music...",
  "str_quest_chat_16201009": "Well, that's just my personal opinion.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201010": "I spent a long time incarcerated in Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201011": "That place was so quiet that it almost drove me mad.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201012": "Although the food wasn't bad and the bed was big enough...",
  "str_quest_chat_16201013": "But being there for such a long time made me miss my noisy Rediesel Wrench buddies.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201014": "Soon enough, I found out that I had fallen in love with rock music without even realizing it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201015": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201016": "If you don't mind rock music, we can listen to some together next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201017": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201018": "But if you don't like it, don't force yourself. It's not a big deal.",
  "str_quest_chat_16201019": "Erm... Cool...",
  "str_quest_chat_16241001": "Hi, I just came by to say hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241002": "Hello, welcome to Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241003": "Soroz? Nice name. It's also impressive inside.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241004": "There's a lounge, cafe, and even a rec room.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241005": "Of course, the best place is the bar.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241006": "It seems you like it here.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241007": "Not particularly. Anywhere's fine for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241008": "In prison, in a tent, in the open air... It doesn't matter.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241009": "But since I have a room to sleep in, food to eat, and even wine to drink...",
  "str_quest_chat_16241010": "I can't help but enjoy every minute here.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241011": "This kind of attitude toward life is truly worth taking on board.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241012": "Let's not talk about that right now. I'm heading to the bar for a drink.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241013": "See you later.",
  "str_quest_chat_16241014": "If only everyone aboard Soroz could be this very easygoing.",
  "str_quest_chat_16251001": "Oh, it looks like you're awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_16251002": "Good morning, Jona.",
  "str_quest_chat_16251003": "You're pretty hard working.",
  "str_quest_chat_16251004": "Not really... I'm just used to waking up at this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16252001": "Tsk, I think I drank too much last night... My head is killing me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16252002": "Thanks to you, the lounge is a mess.",
  "str_quest_chat_16252003": "Hah! I'm so sorry... I'll make it up to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16252004": "Just remember not to bring your weapon with us when drinking...",
  "str_quest_chat_16253001": "Morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16253002": "Eh? You're up already?",
  "str_quest_chat_16253003": "What's that supposed to mean? Can't I get up to have breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_16253004": "O-Of course you can!",
  "str_quest_chat_16253005": "Hmm... You shouldn't wolf your breakfast down.",
  "str_quest_chat_16253006": "It's best to listen to some music while you enjoy it, nice and slowly.",
  "str_quest_chat_16253007": "You're going to play rock music, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16253008": "Hey, you know me well, now!",
  "str_quest_chat_16253009": "It's just that your rock music...",
  "str_quest_chat_16253010": "Is loud enough for people outside the Colossus to hear...",
  "str_quest_chat_16254001": "Hope I'm not disturbing you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16254002": "You mean the sound of gunfire, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_16254003": "Start practicing so early in the morning, you're quite enthusiastic.",
  "str_quest_chat_16254004": "By the way, I have a question...",
  "str_quest_chat_16254005": "Go ahead.",
  "str_quest_chat_16254006": "Does drinking coffee make one shoot more accurately?",
  "str_quest_chat_16254007": "I also heard something like that, but I think it's just mental factors.",
  "str_quest_chat_16254008": "Hitting a target relies more on your reflex and practice.",
  "str_quest_chat_16254009": "Which is why you started practicing shooting early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_16255001": "Urgh... My head hurts.",
  "str_quest_chat_16255002": "Are you ill?",
  "str_quest_chat_16255003": "No, hungover.",
  "str_quest_chat_16255004": "Yeah, I should have known you're too healthy and active to get ill.",
  "str_quest_chat_16255005": "Didn't you get enough sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_16255006": "I went out with the Rediesel Wrench people last night and had a couple of small drinks.",
  "str_quest_chat_16255007": "Small ones? They can't have been small if you got drunk.",
  "str_quest_chat_16255008": "Never mind. I'll mix you up a hangover cure and send it over with a Firefly.",
  "str_quest_chat_16255009": "And don't drink so much next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16255010": "Heh. Thanks, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16256001": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_16256002": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_16256003": "I didn't expect you to get up early.",
  "str_quest_chat_16256004": "You're in luck this time! I've got some rare goods from the Rediesel Desert.",
  "str_quest_chat_16256005": "They're delicious! Come here quickly!",
  "str_quest_chat_16256006": "Oh! Is breakfast really going to be that good?",
  "str_quest_chat_16256007": "I'll come.",
  "str_quest_chat_16256008": "Come on, Vice has already served the table.",
  "str_quest_chat_16256009": "I... I suddenly feel sleepy again.",
  "str_quest_chat_16256010": "Come here! Eat first, and then go to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_16256011": "Okay!",
  "str_quest_chat_16257001": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_16257002": "Tell me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16257003": "Tell you what?",
  "str_quest_chat_16257004": "Why do people get up so early?",
  "str_quest_chat_16257005": "Because of their biological clocks?",
  "str_quest_chat_16257006": "What clocks?",
  "str_quest_chat_16257007": "Is it because... they're just used to it?",
  "str_quest_chat_16257008": "To eat breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_16257009": "Oh, maybe!",
  "str_quest_chat_16257010": "As soon as you said that, I've got a sudden rush of energy.",
  "str_quest_chat_16257011": "Anyway, go eat first!",
  "str_quest_chat_16257012": "We should have some music too!",
  "str_quest_chat_16258001": "Yo, are you up?",
  "str_quest_chat_16258002": "I just got up.",
  "str_quest_chat_16258003": "I'm in a good mood today. I made you a cup of hand-brewed coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat_16258004": "Oh! Thank you, Jona.",
  "str_quest_chat_16258005": "You're welcome. Do you want sugar?",
  "str_quest_chat_16258006": "Yeah, give me lots!",
  "str_quest_chat_16258007": "Heh, I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16258008": "I gave you twenty lumps!",
  "str_quest_chat_16258009": "Sugar-free, please!",
  "str_quest_chat_16258010": "Oh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16258011": "I didn't know you had such a refined taste.",
  "str_quest_chat_16258012": "Okay, I'll send it to you later.",
  "str_quest_chat_16258013": "Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_16261001": "What time is it, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16261002": "A few minutes past noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16261003": "Wow, I slept all the way into the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16261004": "You mean, you just woke up?",
  "str_quest_chat_16261005": "Yeah? Nothing weird about having a nice dream and sleeping in, is there?",
  "str_quest_chat_16261006": "Although missing breakfast is kind of a bummer...",
  "str_quest_chat_16261007": "Hmm... Guess I should just sleep until tomorrow morning, then!",
  "str_quest_chat_16261008": "Talk to you later! Night!",
  "str_quest_chat_16261009": "...Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_16262001": "Noon time! What are you up to?",
  "str_quest_chat_16262002": "I was just getting ready to take a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_16262003": "Oh, then I won't keep you up. Get some sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_16262004": "Hmm? Did you need something from me?",
  "str_quest_chat_16262005": "Nah, just looking for someone to chat with, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat_16262006": "But seeing as how you're busy napping, I guess I'll go practice my marksmanship.",
  "str_quest_chat_16262007": "My gun is starting to get rusty...",
  "str_quest_chat_16262008": "I think I heard your gun go off just now...",
  "str_quest_chat_16262009": "Now I definitely can't sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_16263001": "Have you ever heard the music from Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_16263002": "Yeah, I've heard some...",
  "str_quest_chat_16263003": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_16263004": "Don't you feel they're extremely dull?",
  "str_quest_chat_16263005": "Boring?",
  "str_quest_chat_16263006": "It makes you sleepy. I listened to it as a lullaby when I was in Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_16263007": "It's no comparison with Regina's metal music!",
  "str_quest_chat_16264001": "Where do I find a cleaning rod on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_16264002": "Cleaning rod? What is that?",
  "str_quest_chat_16264003": "A rod about the thickness of a finger, used to clean the gun barrel and stuff.",
  "str_quest_chat_16264004": "Why are you suddenly maintaining your firearm?",
  "str_quest_chat_16264005": "I maintain it every day, but I couldn't find my tools when I needed them today.",
  "str_quest_chat_16264006": "Who'd steal something without any value like that?",
  "str_quest_chat_16264007": "I'm guessing the fireflies swept it away, thinking it was garbage.",
  "str_quest_chat_16264008": "I'll have the fireflies deliver it to your room later.",
  "str_quest_chat_16264009": "You better tell them that it's no garbage.",
  "str_quest_chat_16265001": "I'm up.",
  "str_quest_chat_16265002": "It's noon now, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_16265003": "What, never seen a hangover before?",
  "str_quest_chat_16265004": "You're... the guide from that one time! Did I send the message to you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16265005": "Who did you mean to send it to?",
  "str_quest_chat_16265006": "Azure.",
  "str_quest_chat_16265007": "We went drinking last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_16265008": "Let me see if she's up yet. See you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16265009": "...Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_16266001": "I've just had an awesome idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_16266002": "What's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_16266003": "If I get the rhythm right, I can make gunfire sounds like the drum in a rock and roll song.",
  "str_quest_chat_16266004": "Sounds great. As long as you pay attention to where you're firing.",
  "str_quest_chat_16266005": "Although...",
  "str_quest_chat_16266006": "Although what?",
  "str_quest_chat_16266007": "It would waste a lot of targets.",
  "str_quest_chat_16267001": "I always feel sleepy at noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16267002": "Do you want to sleep for a while?",
  "str_quest_chat_16267003": "Good idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_16267004": "But I don't want to sleep now.",
  "str_quest_chat_16267005": "Let's get some shooting practice.",
  "str_quest_chat_16267006": "Huh? Aren't you sleepy?",
  "str_quest_chat_16267007": "But the smell of gunpowder fills me with energy.",
  "str_quest_chat_16267008": "Really...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16268001": "It's a beautiful day.",
  "str_quest_chat_16268002": "Have you thought of what you want to do today?",
  "str_quest_chat_16268003": "Hmm... Go to the Holiday Cafe and have some coffee and tea?",
  "str_quest_chat_16268004": "Spend the afternoon lazing around.",
  "str_quest_chat_16268005": "Oh? I didn't know you had such good taste.",
  "str_quest_chat_16268006": "I think I'll come along and see this for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_16268007": "You're welcome to.",
  "str_quest_chat_16301001": "Are you busy, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16301002": "No, just chilling in my room. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_16301003": "I-I got a favor to ask of you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16301004": "Sure, shoot.",
  "str_quest_chat_16301005": "But I have to talk to you in person.",
  "str_quest_chat_16301006": "All right. I'll come over right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_16361001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_16361002": "Good afternoon, Ophina.",
  "str_quest_chat_16361003": "I thought about it all morning... I think you're absolutely incredible!",
  "str_quest_chat_16361004": "H-Huh?! Why do you say that?!",
  "str_quest_chat_16361005": "You're able to pilot a gigantic Colossus, plus you can see the Light Trails!",
  "str_quest_chat_16361006": "Ahaha... It's really nothing special.",
  "str_quest_chat_16361007": "Everyone has something that they're good at.",
  "str_quest_chat_16361008": "Really? But I think you have lots more things that you're good at...",
  "str_quest_chat_16361009": "Aside from being able to pilot this Colossus... Your cooking skills are also incredible! Like today's lunch, it was absolutely delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_16361010": "Lunch? But the lunch was prepared by the Fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat_16361011": "Uh... Well, that means you've taught the Fireflies well!",
  "str_quest_chat_16361012": "In any case, someone talented enough to pilot this big guy has to be talented at everything they do!",
  "str_quest_chat_16361013": "Ehehe... Is that how it's supposed to work?",
  "str_quest_chat_16361014": "Well, all the same... Thanks for the praise, Ophina.",
  "str_quest_chat_16362001": "Navigator, good afternoon*&*%#@#...",
  "str_quest_chat_16362002": "Ophina?!",
  "str_quest_chat_16362003": "Are you okay?!",
  "str_quest_chat_16362004": "Ah... I'm... I'm fine...",
  "str_quest_chat_16362005": "I was just trying to wish you a good afternoon through the Terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat_16362006": "But I was so focused on the Terminal that I bumped into a wall in the corridor...",
  "str_quest_chat_16362007": "Be careful...",
  "str_quest_chat_16362008": "Though there aren't any Eclipsites on the Colossus, there definitely are a lot of corners.",
  "str_quest_chat_16362009": "Try not to look at the Terminal while walking.",
  "str_quest_chat_16362010": "U-Understood.",
  "str_quest_chat_16362011": "I'll remember that...",
  "str_quest_chat_16363001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_16363002": "Good afternoon, Ophina.",
  "str_quest_chat_16363003": "I feel like my shoulders are always sore these days.",
  "str_quest_chat_16363004": "My body has become so sluggish.",
  "str_quest_chat_16363005": "Ah...",
  "str_quest_chat_16363006": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16363007": "Could it be that, on your shoulder...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16363008": "On my shoulder...",
  "str_quest_chat_16363009": "There's something... You can't see...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16363010": "Can't see...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16363011": "Oww...!",
  "str_quest_chat_16363012": "W-What are you talking about!",
  "str_quest_chat_16363013": "Heh, just kidding.",
  "str_quest_chat_16363014": "Maybe your horns are too heavy?",
  "str_quest_chat_16363015": "Although they are beautiful, they're also quite a burden on your body.",
  "str_quest_chat_16363016": "Ah... You said they were beautiful...",
  "str_quest_chat_16363017": "Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_16364001": "Sigh, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_16364002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_16364003": "I haven't seen Her Majesty recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_16364004": "Oh... So, that's what it is.",
  "str_quest_chat_16364005": "Doesn't she... like me anymore?",
  "str_quest_chat_16364006": "That's probably not it. Maybe she's just busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_16364007": "If it's really bothering you, I'll take you to see Her Majesty with Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_16364008": "Oh? Can you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16364009": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_16364010": "Then, please take me!",
  "str_quest_chat_16381001": "Navigator, you should get some sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_16381002": "If you don't sleep, something terrible will happen!",
  "str_quest_chat_16381003": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16381004": "So, basically—get yourself to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_16381005": "Got it... You should go to bed early, too, Ophina.",
  "str_quest_chat_16381006": "I'm already sleeping!",
  "str_quest_chat_16382001": "Do you listen to bedtime stories, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16382002": "I do!",
  "str_quest_chat_16382003": "Soroz used to read them to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16382004": "But not anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_16382005": "I did love them when I was little, though.",
  "str_quest_chat_16382006": "I-Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_16382007": "Then I shall read a story before going to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_16383001": "I'm so... sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_16383002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16383003": "Go to bed early then.",
  "str_quest_chat_16383004": "No... I have to say good night to you properly before I can sleep, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_16383005": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_16383006": "We've already said goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_16383007": "Hehe...",
  "str_quest_chat_16383008": "Get to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_16383009": "Right...",
  "str_quest_chat_16384001": "It's time to go to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_16384002": "Well, you should go to bed soon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16384003": "By the way...",
  "str_quest_chat_16384004": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16384005": "Well, I've always wondered about your horns... Do they make you lose sleep at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_16384006": "Erm...",
  "str_quest_chat_16384007": "I think I'm used to it. I don't really feel anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_16384008": "That green glow sets my mind at ease...",
  "str_quest_chat_16384009": "I see. That's good to hear.",
  "str_quest_chat_16384010": "Sweet dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_16384011": "Thank you, and goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_16441001": "Nice to meet you. I am Beverly, a Lumopolis noble and member of the Guard.",
  "str_quest_chat_16441002": "I heard you are a Caelestite, but you don't seem much different from a civilian to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16441003": "That hurts, but true.",
  "str_quest_chat_16441004": "You can rest assured, then, that I will protect civilians like you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16441005": "It's very safe on the Colossus, though.",
  "str_quest_chat_16441006": "You're the first one to ever decline a noble's offer to protect.",
  "str_quest_chat_16441007": "I get it. No wonder you're a Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_16441008": "How did you jump to that conclusion?",
  "str_quest_chat_16461001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16461002": "Good afternoon! This is a rather rare occasion.",
  "str_quest_chat_16461003": "It's etiquette. Have you had lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_16461004": "Not yet, but?",
  "str_quest_chat_16461005": "I believe there's some misunderstanding.",
  "str_quest_chat_16461006": "I just wanted to ask you whether there's normal food around.",
  "str_quest_chat_16461007": "Um, sorry about that!",
  "str_quest_chat_16462001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_16462002": "Oh... Good afternoon, Beverly...",
  "str_quest_chat_16462003": "What can I do for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16462004": "Don't worry, I'm just here to say hi.",
  "str_quest_chat_16462005": "And wish you a pleasant afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16462006": "O-Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_16462007": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16463001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16463002": "Afternoon, Beverly.",
  "str_quest_chat_16463003": "Whilst eating today, I accidentally knocked over the glass used for drinking brewed wine.",
  "str_quest_chat_16463004": "Are there still glasses like that in the Colossus' kitchen?",
  "str_quest_chat_16463005": "No. It was my own personal glass.",
  "str_quest_chat_16463006": "Ah, I should've expected that of a sophisticated noble...",
  "str_quest_chat_16463007": "It's alright. I just wanted to let you know I've cleaned up all the liquid I spilled in the dining room.",
  "str_quest_chat_16463008": "It's okay, the Fireflies would have taken care of it anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_16463009": "No, no, I need to take responsibility for my mistakes.",
  "str_quest_chat_16463010": "Alright... I understand where you're coming from.",
  "str_quest_chat_16464001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16464002": "Ahem. G-Good afternoon, Beverly.",
  "str_quest_chat_16464003": "You sound weird. Did something happen?",
  "str_quest_chat_16464004": "Weird?",
  "str_quest_chat_16464005": "No, nothing...",
  "str_quest_chat_16464006": "I just wanted to follow the Lumopolis etiquette in replying to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16464007": "I appreciate the thought.",
  "str_quest_chat_16464008": "But I don't mind you being yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_16464009": "Alright, then...",
  "str_quest_chat_16481001": "A peaceful evening to you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16481002": "Thanks, Beverly. Same to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16481003": "While we are on the subject...",
  "str_quest_chat_16481004": "Listening to a traditional stage drama is an excellent source of peace and tranquility.",
  "str_quest_chat_16481005": "Yeah, I happened to sit through a play once before.",
  "str_quest_chat_16481006": "Even though it was the middle of the day, I felt so relaxed I could have fallen asleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_16481007": "That is unacceptable, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_16481008": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16481009": "A traditional drama must be appreciated and enjoyed with the utmost attention!",
  "str_quest_chat_16481010": "Next time the opportunity presents itself, you will accompany me to a stage production, and you will learn to appreciate it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16481011": "Please look forward to it, and pleasant dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_16481012": "...Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_16482001": "Good evening, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_16482002": "Hello... And thank you for your greeting.",
  "str_quest_chat_16482003": "Why do you always address me with such formality whenever we speak?",
  "str_quest_chat_16482004": "Sorry, I didn't even notice...",
  "str_quest_chat_16482005": "Do you also feel that my manner of speech is somewhat... conceited?",
  "str_quest_chat_16482006": "Ah... Um.. Kind of...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16482007": "Well, Caelestite... I praise you for plucking up the courage to express your honest opinion.",
  "str_quest_chat_16482008": "And I also accept that you are not approving of my nature.",
  "str_quest_chat_16482009": "I never said that! You're fine the way you are...",
  "str_quest_chat_16482010": "If only you truly felt that way, but alas... It is time for you to take your leave.",
  "str_quest_chat_16482011": "You may now take your break.",
  "str_quest_chat_16482012": "...As you wish.",
  "str_quest_chat_16483001": "Sleep well. Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_16483002": "Huh? That's a little sudden.",
  "str_quest_chat_16483003": "It was just a casual goodnight greeting.",
  "str_quest_chat_16483004": "Oh... Well, night then.",
  "str_quest_chat_16484001": "It's so late. I guess it's time to rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_16484002": "Yeah, I'm really sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_16484003": "You need plenty of sleep to make sure you have enough energy for the next day.",
  "str_quest_chat_16484004": "So, you'd better go to sleep as soon as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_16484005": "You sound concerned, but you also sound like you're forcing me...",
  "str_quest_chat_16485001": "Another day's work has been done.",
  "str_quest_chat_16485002": "Busy again today, Beverly?",
  "str_quest_chat_16485003": "Busy as usual, but it's not a big deal for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16485004": "To guard Lumopolis—this is my duty as a noble.",
  "str_quest_chat_16485005": "Hmm... I can feel your conviction.",
  "str_quest_chat_16485006": "Even so, remember to have a good rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_16485007": "I will. Thank you for being so concerned.",
  "str_quest_chat_16486001": "The day is about to end...",
  "str_quest_chat_16486002": "Sometimes, a day seems so short.",
  "str_quest_chat_16486003": "Maybe it's because you're usually so busy?",
  "str_quest_chat_16486004": "You should take a break from work to occasionally do some activities you're interested in.",
  "str_quest_chat_16486005": "Activities? Well, I like to play darts in my spare time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16486006": "Hitting the bullseye feels just like being struck by lightning... It's so stimulating.",
  "str_quest_chat_16486007": "I've never heard someone put it like that before...",
  "str_quest_chat_16487001": "It's nighttime again.",
  "str_quest_chat_16487002": "Are you resting?",
  "str_quest_chat_16487003": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_16487004": "I'll rest soon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16487005": "What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16487006": "Not yet. I'm cleaning my Lightning Spear.",
  "str_quest_chat_16487007": "Weapons also have souls... Through its silence, I can feel my spear's inner thoughts.",
  "str_quest_chat_16487008": "It seems you have some special kind of connection with your Lightning Spear.",
  "str_quest_chat_16501001": "It's nothing special being on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_16501002": "Sorry to disappoint you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16501003": "The facilities are passable, but on the boring side.",
  "str_quest_chat_16501004": "However, I can make this a livelier place!",
  "str_quest_chat_16501005": "What are you planning to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_16501006": "Hey, where is she?",
  "str_quest_chat_16501007": "I'm Curo. Just ignore that rude dummy.",
  "str_quest_chat_16501008": "I'm afraid she is doing something horrible to Soroz...",
  "str_quest_chat_16501009": "You should stop her!",
  "str_quest_chat_16501010": "Nothing I can do about that.",
  "str_quest_chat_16501011": "What? What do you mean nothing you can do?",
  "str_quest_chat_16501012": "I'm back! What nonsense was Curo trying to feed you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16501013": "Hey, answer my question!",
  "str_quest_chat_16551001": "It's morning... Explosion!",
  "str_quest_chat_16551002": "Wait, what?",
  "str_quest_chat_16551003": "I said, explosion!",
  "str_quest_chat_16551004": "What? Where?",
  "str_quest_chat_16551005": "What I mean is... There will be an explosion if you don't get up!",
  "str_quest_chat_16551006": "What's that mean?!",
  "str_quest_chat_16552001": "Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat_16552002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16552003": "I-I'm here!",
  "str_quest_chat_16552004": "Come witness our duel!",
  "str_quest_chat_16552005": "Already?!",
  "str_quest_chat_16552006": "Wait a second!",
  "str_quest_chat_16552007": "Don't do it on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_16552008": "Don't be so petty! Not even wargaming?",
  "str_quest_chat_16552009": "Huh? Oh, it's just wargaming.",
  "str_quest_chat_16552010": "Then it's all good.",
  "str_quest_chat_16553001": "Oh! Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_16553002": "Good morning, Benny and Curo.",
  "str_quest_chat_16553003": "Curo's not up yet! She's sleeping in today!",
  "str_quest_chat_16553004": "Is that so? I never knew Curo was the kind to sleep in.",
  "str_quest_chat_16553005": "Quit talking behind my back, Benny!",
  "str_quest_chat_16553006": "Hey! What are you doing!?",
  "str_quest_chat_16553007": "Do you two always start arguing so early...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16554001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_16554002": "Is that Curo? Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_16554003": "You got it!",
  "str_quest_chat_16554004": "What about me? Not gonna say good morning to me, PlayerName!?",
  "str_quest_chat_16554005": "... Good morning too, Benny... Have you had breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_16554006": "Yeah, the breakfast was delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_16554007": "Enough chit-chat! Benny still needs to clear the table!",
  "str_quest_chat_16554008": "Alright, alright... You know how difficult Curo can be—I'd better go!",
  "str_quest_chat_16555001": "What a glorious day!",
  "str_quest_chat_16555002": "Right, a new day has dawned.",
  "str_quest_chat_16555003": "Can it be...? You two actually agreed on something this morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_16555004": "As long as Benny doesn't start messing around, we might be able to keep this going.",
  "str_quest_chat_16555005": "Huh? Messing around!? It's called \"fun,\" you should try it sometime!",
  "str_quest_chat_16555006": "Also, Curo's the one who always kills my vibe with her snide comments...",
  "str_quest_chat_16555007": "Benny!",
  "str_quest_chat_16555008": "Ah... Sorry, I seem to have triggered both of you by accident...",
  "str_quest_chat_16556001": "Good morning, PlayerName. How did you sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_16556002": "I slept very well, and I feel ready for a great day.",
  "str_quest_chat_16556003": "I slept okay, but I'm still sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_16556004": "PlayerName is awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_16556005": "Did Curo wake you up?",
  "str_quest_chat_16556006": "No, I woke up by myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_16556007": "You're a very sensible young man, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_16556008": "Curo! We have a score to settle!",
  "str_quest_chat_16561001": "Hey, Caelestite! I have to complain this!",
  "str_quest_chat_16561002": "What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_16561003": "First thing's first, I'm Curo.",
  "str_quest_chat_16561004": "Second, I demand that you improve the quality of our meals here!",
  "str_quest_chat_16561005": "Otherwise, I swear... I'm gonna LOSE IT!",
  "str_quest_chat_16561006": "No, wait! Let's just talk things out first. There is no need to blow up the Colossus, okay...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16561007": "Also... aren't you Benny?",
  "str_quest_chat_16561008": "Sorry, that was Benny speaking just now. I'm the real Curo.",
  "str_quest_chat_16561009": "Don't listen to anything that moron says.",
  "str_quest_chat_16561010": "As long as there's food for us to eat, we're fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_16561011": "Like hell! Give us better stuff to eat!",
  "str_quest_chat_16561012": "Don't worry, I'll take both of your suggestions into consideration.",
  "str_quest_chat_16561013": "Ha! Now that's more like it!",
  "str_quest_chat_16561014": "Don't take anything she says personally, she doesn't know what she's talking about.",
  "str_quest_chat_16561015": "I can't tell who's who, anymore...",
  "str_quest_chat_16562001": "I'd like to file a grievance.",
  "str_quest_chat_16562002": "What? You sound so serious... Are you Curo?",
  "str_quest_chat_16562003": "You can't be Benny, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_16562004": "It is Curo.",
  "str_quest_chat_16562005": "The rec room is far too dull. Can we spruce it up?",
  "str_quest_chat_16562006": "Such as something loud, explosive, and... Argh!",
  "str_quest_chat_16562007": "???",
  "str_quest_chat_16562008": "Ignore that gibberish, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_16562009": "The fool was pretending to be me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16562010": "Which one are you now, really?",
  "str_quest_chat_16651001": "Rise and shine, Navigator! It's almost noon!",
  "str_quest_chat_16651002": "What? What time is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_16651003": "Twelve noon!",
  "str_quest_chat_16651004": "I'm done for! Vice's going to chew me out for this!",
  "str_quest_chat_16651005": "Hey, it's only six o'clock!",
  "str_quest_chat_16651006": "Ha ha, gotcha! I was just joking around!",
  "str_quest_chat_16652001": "Buzz... Navigator! Do you copy?",
  "str_quest_chat_16652002": "Copy.",
  "str_quest_chat_16652003": "Can I help you with anything, Ansia?",
  "str_quest_chat_16652004": "Absolutely! And it's very important!",
  "str_quest_chat_16652005": "What prompted you to use the Terminal so early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_16652006": "Obviously because I have something important to announce.",
  "str_quest_chat_16652007": "Hmm? What?",
  "str_quest_chat_16652008": "The facility to enhance communication signals from Illumina to Soroz has been successfully installed!",
  "str_quest_chat_16652009": "It's been tested and is fully functional!",
  "str_quest_chat_16652010": "By the way, this terminal communication is being sent from the depths of Gannon City.",
  "str_quest_chat_16652011": "In the future, you'll only need to pay regular maintenance fees to use the facility.",
  "str_quest_chat_16652012": "What?! When was it installed?!",
  "str_quest_chat_16652013": "How come I don't know anything about this?",
  "str_quest_chat_16652014": "And how much is the maintenance fee?!",
  "str_quest_chat_16652015": "Ansia? Ansia!",
  "str_quest_chat_16652016": "System prompt: The user is not in service range. Please try again later.",
  "str_quest_chat_16652017": "Don't pretend to have a bad signal, answer me!",
  "str_quest_chat_16653001": "Testing, testing... this is an equipment test.",
  "str_quest_chat_16653002": "Dedicated comms channels... encrypted tests... reversed comms restrictions...",
  "str_quest_chat_16653003": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16653004": "... It's the pig head! The pig head has appeared!",
  "str_quest_chat_16653005": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_16653006": "It's some kind of prank, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_16653007": "Haha, I'm just pulling your leg.",
  "str_quest_chat_16653008": "Navigator, aren't you wide awake now? Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_16653009": "Good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_16653010": "I think I'd be in a better mood if I wasn't just pranked!",
  "str_quest_chat_16681001": "Good evening, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_16681002": "Oh, good evening, Ansia.",
  "str_quest_chat_16681003": "Another busy and fulfilling day comes to an end.",
  "str_quest_chat_16681004": "Do you have any messages you need me to relay to the others?",
  "str_quest_chat_16681005": "Hmm... No, I don't think I have anything that needs broadcasting right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_16681006": "Beginning transmission...",
  "str_quest_chat_16681007": "Attention, crew! The Navigator is thoroughly displeased with every single one of you!",
  "str_quest_chat_16681008": "As such, there is nothing to say to any of you right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_16681009": "Huh?! Y-You didn't actually send that out, did you?!",
  "str_quest_chat_16681010": "Hahahaha! Gotcha again, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_16681011": "Oh, Ansia! For the love of...",
  "str_quest_chat_16682001": "It's time for the nightly broadcast again!",
  "str_quest_chat_16682002": "I've been considering playing music before bedtime to help everyone relax.",
  "str_quest_chat_16682003": "Any suggestions, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16682004": "Nothing in particular, really...",
  "str_quest_chat_16682005": "But something soothing should go a long way.",
  "str_quest_chat_16682006": "Okay, Burning Rediesel it is!",
  "str_quest_chat_16682007": "To be performed by Regina!",
  "str_quest_chat_16682008": "Hold it! That doesn't sound soothing at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_16682009": "Hahaha, I was just kidding!",
  "str_quest_chat_16683001": "Good evening, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_16683002": "Good evening, Ansia.",
  "str_quest_chat_16683003": "After a day's work, I can finally rest...",
  "str_quest_chat_16683004": "When you work, work hard, and when you rest, rest properly!",
  "str_quest_chat_16683005": "Working hard, I get that, but resting properly...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16683006": "You don't have any pranks up your sleeve?",
  "str_quest_chat_16683007": "*Cough* Not today. I just meant you should sleep well!",
  "str_quest_chat_16684001": "The night is here! It's time for our daily summary!",
  "str_quest_chat_16684002": "What did you do today, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16684003": "I did some running, eating, and checking the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_16684004": "That's about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16684005": "So, today's conclusion is—",
  "str_quest_chat_16684006": "The Navigator had another lazy day!",
  "str_quest_chat_16684007": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_16685001": "This is Ansia. Do you receive me?",
  "str_quest_chat_16685002": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_16685003": "Oh, I thought the terminal had broken down again.",
  "str_quest_chat_16685004": "It seems the repairs were successful. Now, you can have a good rest!",
  "str_quest_chat_16685005": "Ansia, you should turn in early. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_16686001": "Evening broadcast—emergency report!",
  "str_quest_chat_16686002": "What's happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_16686003": "Hmm... Guess, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16686004": "One of your pranks failed?",
  "str_quest_chat_16686005": "One of your pranks succeeded?",
  "str_quest_chat_16686006": "Oh! You're in the right ballpark! However, success is not guaranteed yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_16686007": "What do you mean by that?",
  "str_quest_chat_16686008": "Navigator, take a look under your bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_16686009": "Wowzers! What a huge spider! When did you do this!?",
  "str_quest_chat_16686010": "It's just a cute little spider toy—",
  "str_quest_chat_16686011": "It worked!",
  "str_quest_chat_16701001": "Looking for me?",
  "str_quest_chat_16701002": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_16701003": "But Gronru just came to me and told me...",
  "str_quest_chat_16701004": "Want to have a chat with you",
  "str_quest_chat_16701005": "Is that so? Gronru did say...",
  "str_quest_chat_16701006": "Something like \"The Navigator wants to talk to you in person.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_16701007": "I'm at the bridge. It's boring here. Come over quick if you got something to talk about.",
  "str_quest_chat_16701008": "Okay, I'll be right there.",
  "str_quest_chat_16701031": "Are you all right, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16701032": "So what happened? And why am I in the lounge?",
  "str_quest_chat_16701033": "I fell off the bridge into miles below.",
  "str_quest_chat_16701034": "Really?!",
  "str_quest_chat_16701035": "I believe it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16701036": "Just kidding. You slipped on the stairs, hit your head, and passed out.",
  "str_quest_chat_16701037": "Take it easy for now. We'll talk about the \"research subject\" when you're ready.",
  "str_quest_chat_16701038": "Can I say no?",
  "str_quest_chat_16701039": "Gotta go, Vice wants me to write a report.",
  "str_quest_chat_16741001": "Are you the Colossus Navigator, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_16741002": "Yes. Uh, how do you do?",
  "str_quest_chat_16741003": "Why are you so nervous?",
  "str_quest_chat_16741004": "Well, I wouldn't call it nervous...",
  "str_quest_chat_16741005": "I'm not, am I?",
  "str_quest_chat_16741006": "Then why do you stand so far away from me?",
  "str_quest_chat_16741007": "Is this far?",
  "str_quest_chat_16741008": "Let me see... It's almost two meters.",
  "str_quest_chat_16741009": "I don't feel comfortable getting too close with that blade in your hand.",
  "str_quest_chat_16741010": "Don't worry about that. It's true that I really am interested in you...",
  "str_quest_chat_16741011": "But I'm not in hurry to dissect you, either.",
  "str_quest_chat_16741012": "You really want to dissect me?",
  "str_quest_chat_16761001": "It's time for my afternoon nap!",
  "str_quest_chat_16761002": "Do you want to take a nap as well, my dear?",
  "str_quest_chat_16761003": "I was just on my way, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_16761004": "Oho? Very good!",
  "str_quest_chat_16761005": "Not today, I just had a cup of coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat_16761006": "Ah, but it's such a leisurely day today...",
  "str_quest_chat_16761007": "You don't have to overdo this, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_16761008": "Why don't you stop by my room and come see me?",
  "str_quest_chat_16761009": "Huh? Why should I do that...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16761010": "You said you wanted to take a nap with me, didn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16761011": "I never agreed to anything like that!",
  "str_quest_chat_16761012": "Oh, my young friend! Please don't be so resistance.",
  "str_quest_chat_16761013": "Although, I wouldn't mind waiting for you to fall asleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_16761014": "To do a little research on the only Caelestite we have.",
  "str_quest_chat_16761015": "S-Sorry, I just remembered I have more work to do! Have a nice day!",
  "str_quest_chat_16762001": "Can I ask you something, my dear?",
  "str_quest_chat_16762002": "Sure?",
  "str_quest_chat_16762003": "Are your Fireflies capable of feeding people?",
  "str_quest_chat_16762004": "Theoretically... yes?",
  "str_quest_chat_16762005": "Mmm... That's good to know.",
  "str_quest_chat_16762006": "I can use them as a temporary replacement for Lilliam.",
  "str_quest_chat_16762007": "Now, be a dear and reprogram them to feed me my lunch, would you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16762008": "Huh? Are you injured or something?",
  "str_quest_chat_16762009": "My heart broken, if you must ask.",
  "str_quest_chat_16762010": "If you're not physically injured, then just let the Fireflies go.",
  "str_quest_chat_16762011": "*Sigh* Forget it. I won't trouble you with this anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_16762012": "I could always find a way to reprogram the Fireflies myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_16762013": "If you knew how to do that, you would have finished your lunch a long time ago...",
  "str_quest_chat_16763001": "Good morning, my dear.",
  "str_quest_chat_16763002": "Morning? It's already noon...",
  "str_quest_chat_16763003": "Oh? I must have forgotten to look at the clock when I woke up.",
  "str_quest_chat_16763004": "No wonder I'm still so sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_16763005": "But you just woke up, didn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16763006": "My biological clock doesn't lie, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16763007": "Which means... It's time for my afternoon nap!",
  "str_quest_chat_16763008": "Have a nice afternoon, my dear.",
  "str_quest_chat_16763009": "Oh, and don't forget to have someone bring me my lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat_16763010": "...Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_16764001": "Young man.",
  "str_quest_chat_16764002": "Young man?",
  "str_quest_chat_16764003": "My, are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_16764004": "Then I shall take this wonderful opportunity to study the Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_16764005": "I'm awake!",
  "str_quest_chat_16764006": "So Caelestites have the ability to sense danger and wake up quickly?",
  "str_quest_chat_16764007": "That's a surprise discovery.",
  "str_quest_chat_16764008": "How many more secrets are hidden inside this small body of yours...",
  "str_quest_chat_16764009": "I'm, I'm just a normal Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat_16764010": "There's nothing special about me!",
  "str_quest_chat_16764011": "Don't try to fool a Researcher.",
  "str_quest_chat_16764012": "Besides, it only drives my curiosity.",
  "str_quest_chat_16764013": "Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat_16764014": "But now that you are awake, I will have to save my research for another day.",
  "str_quest_chat_16764015": "I suppose I should be grateful...",
  "str_quest_chat_16764016": "Bring my lunch to me if you really feel like thanking me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16765001": "Hmm... It's already noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16765002": "Taking your break?",
  "str_quest_chat_16765003": "No, still working.",
  "str_quest_chat_16765004": "Wow, that's a first. You, not slacking.",
  "str_quest_chat_16765005": "I'm just doing a small experiment. I need to monitor and record the results.",
  "str_quest_chat_16765006": "And that means I need to concentrate, kid. So I can't slack off.",
  "str_quest_chat_16765007": "Hmm, I'd never thought of you as the conscientious type.",
  "str_quest_chat_16765008": "I'm going for a nap. Enjoy your work.",
  "str_quest_chat_16765009": "Off you go, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_16781001": "It's time to go back to bed, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16781002": "Yeah, I was just about to go to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_16781003": "As soon as I finish reading this book.",
  "str_quest_chat_16781004": "Put the book down, Navigator. One should not continue hardworking this late, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_16781005": "Why does it seem like you never want to see me working hard?",
  "str_quest_chat_16781006": "It seems like such a waste of time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16781007": "Well, I can't just lie around and sleep in every day like someone I know...",
  "str_quest_chat_16781008": "I can afford to sleep in because of my efficiency, thank you very much.",
  "str_quest_chat_16781009": "Efficiency...? I don't think I've ever seen you do any kind of work...",
  "str_quest_chat_16781010": "I see... Well, why don't I go see you in your room...",
  "str_quest_chat_16781011": "And show you my latest dissection methods?",
  "str_quest_chat_16781012": "N-No thanks, I'll take your word for it! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_16782001": "Are you asleep, my dear?",
  "str_quest_chat_16782002": "N-Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_16782003": "Perfect! I wanted to ask you...",
  "str_quest_chat_16782004": "Do you know the sex of this Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_16782005": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_16782006": "Well, considering that the Colossi are a fusion of biology and technology...",
  "str_quest_chat_16782007": "It stands to reason that Soroz should have biologically assigned sex.",
  "str_quest_chat_16782008": "I don't really know if the Colossi have different sexes...",
  "str_quest_chat_16782009": "But I've always seen Soroz as a kind and dependable...",
  "str_quest_chat_16782010": "Big brother.",
  "str_quest_chat_16782011": "An older male, eh? How disappointing.",
  "str_quest_chat_16782012": "What's so disappointing about it...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16782013": "Big sister.",
  "str_quest_chat_16782014": "Oho? How intriguing...",
  "str_quest_chat_16782015": "I can't help but feel an uncontrollable desire to research this even further...",
  "str_quest_chat_16782016": "That is way too weird.",
  "str_quest_chat_16783001": "Let me ask you something, my dear...",
  "str_quest_chat_16783002": "When will we build a laboratory aboard the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_16783003": "Why does the Colossus need a laboratory...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16783004": "How can I be expected to work without one?",
  "str_quest_chat_16783005": "...What kind of work are we talking about here?",
  "str_quest_chat_16783006": "Eclipsite dissections, Caelestite dissections... I'm not picky, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_16783007": "...And I'm not in a hurry to build that laboratory, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_16783008": "So you don't want to let me work?",
  "str_quest_chat_16783009": "*Sigh* I was just starting to feel guilty about all my freeloading...",
  "str_quest_chat_16783010": "Ah well, time for bed! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_16783011": "Ugh... Maybe I should think about it, after all...",
  "str_quest_chat_16784001": "I'm starting to understand why people say Gannon City seems more like a machine than a metropolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_16784002": "During the day, everything works like clockwork. At night it's silent.",
  "str_quest_chat_16784003": "Enjoying the night view?",
  "str_quest_chat_16784004": "Of course. You should take a look too, youngster.",
  "str_quest_chat_16784005": "I've seen it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16784006": "I've been to Gannon City lots of times.",
  "str_quest_chat_16784007": "I've never seen it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16784008": "I'll take a look if I get a chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_16784009": "It's late. How come you aren't asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_16784010": "Me? I'm in no rush to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_16784011": "I want to use the Diving Spines to enjoy the nighttime views of this city I protect for a little longer.",
  "str_quest_chat_16784012": "Anyway, you're younger than me. Why do you need more sleep than I do?",
  "str_quest_chat_16784013": "Maybe it's a sign of premature aging?",
  "str_quest_chat_16784014": "I-It's not!",
  "str_quest_chat_16784015": "I'm going to bed. Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_16785001": "Night has fallen, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_16785002": "But I think I'll have to stay up late to finish my research.",
  "str_quest_chat_16785003": "It's so late already. Can't you do it tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat_16785004": "No, otherwise this inspiration in my mind will disappear.",
  "str_quest_chat_16785005": "I think I should continue working hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_16785006": "A night of hard work sounds pretty good...",
  "str_quest_chat_16786001": "Good evening, young man.",
  "str_quest_chat_16786002": "Good evening, Migard.",
  "str_quest_chat_16786003": "I feel so alone...",
  "str_quest_chat_16786004": "It's such a nice night, but I can't find any pretty girls to chat with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16786005": "You can't find a girl, so you came to find me...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16786006": "Oh, it's not like that! After all, you're also my research subject!",
  "str_quest_chat_16786007": "Come on, let's discuss my new research!",
  "str_quest_chat_16786008": "*cough* No, I should go to bed. Goodnight!",
  "str_quest_chat_16787001": "Are you resting?",
  "str_quest_chat_16787002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_16787003": "I'm going to have a rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_16787004": "Don't be complacent, young man.",
  "str_quest_chat_16787005": "Nighttime is the best time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16787006": "Are you generally more active at night, Migard?",
  "str_quest_chat_16787007": "You can study with a clearer mind at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_16787008": "I get the feeling you're a very dedicated researcher, Migard.",
  "str_quest_chat_16787009": "And the girls in the salon dress a little skimpier at night. It would be a waste not to look at them.",
  "str_quest_chat_16787010": "Now, that's dedication...",
  "str_quest_chat_16788001": "Good evening, my lovely Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16788002": "Did you really need to add that particular adjective?",
  "str_quest_chat_16788003": "I cannot betray my inner thoughts.",
  "str_quest_chat_16788004": "So, what would you like me to call you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16788005": "Handsome Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16788006": "Just call me PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_16788007": "So, that's what you want to hear...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16788008": "I understand, my lovely Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16788009": "... You're incorrigible.",
  "str_quest_chat_16789001": "Night has imperceptibly crept up on us again.",
  "str_quest_chat_16789002": "A day is short, is it not?",
  "str_quest_chat_16789003": "It's rare to hear you say that kind of thing, Migard...",
  "str_quest_chat_16789004": "Is it because you worked hard today?",
  "str_quest_chat_16789005": "Of course, as a competent researcher, I put my all into my work every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_16789006": "And here comes the bragging...",
  "str_quest_chat_16789007": "Ahem... You're really a force to be reckoned with in your field, Migard.",
  "str_quest_chat_16789008": "I love it when you say nice things about me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16842001": "How does it feel?",
  "str_quest_chat_16842002": "Not bad, much better than I expected.",
  "str_quest_chat_16842003": "Though it's a little difficult to control...",
  "str_quest_chat_16842004": "Really? You seem to be doing it with ease.",
  "str_quest_chat_16842005": "... It's the lollipops.",
  "str_quest_chat_16842006": "I guess you always keep a stock on you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16842007": "You must really love it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16842008": "Not quite love, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_16842009": "Something terrible would happen without my lollipops!",
  "str_quest_chat_16842010": "Terrible?",
  "str_quest_chat_16842011": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_16842012": "And...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16842013": "Let me finish a lollipop, then tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16842014": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_16861001": "Dynferlun, Iranuttalullapup.",
  "str_quest_chat_16861002": "What did you say?",
  "str_quest_chat_16861003": "Lullapup!",
  "str_quest_chat_16861004": "What the heck is that?",
  "str_quest_chat_16861005": "I said, it's time for lunch and I ran out of lollipop!",
  "str_quest_chat_16861006": "You eat lollipops for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_16862001": "All clear.",
  "str_quest_chat_16862002": "Huh...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16862003": "Did you forget?",
  "str_quest_chat_16862004": "You asked me to perform maintenance on the Colossus' electrical systems three days ago.",
  "str_quest_chat_16862005": "I just finished, and it's all clear now.",
  "str_quest_chat_16862006": "I'm off to eat my lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_16862007": "But these systems need to be maintained every day...",
  "str_quest_chat_16862008": "Oh? I'll need extra lollipops, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_16863001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16863002": "Want a lollipop before taking your nap?",
  "str_quest_chat_16863003": "Thanks, but not for now.",
  "str_quest_chat_16863004": "I'm working on my self-restraint!",
  "str_quest_chat_16863005": "I've set a small goal for myself—",
  "str_quest_chat_16863006": "A full day without snacks!",
  "str_quest_chat_16863007": "Oh, keep it up, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_16863008": "I'm off to take my break.",
  "str_quest_chat_16863009": "Wait--!",
  "str_quest_chat_16863010": "Remember to brush your teeth before bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_16864001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_16864002": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_16864003": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_16864004": "Daydreaming...",
  "str_quest_chat_16864005": "Eating...",
  "str_quest_chat_16864006": "Oh.",
  "str_quest_chat_16864007": "I just completed a boxing exercise.",
  "str_quest_chat_16864008": "Do you have more training in the afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_16864009": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_16864010": "That's exciting, Tessa.",
  "str_quest_chat_16865001": "Tsk...",
  "str_quest_chat_16865002": "What's wrong, Tessa?",
  "str_quest_chat_16865003": "You seem irritated.",
  "str_quest_chat_16865004": "We're running out of lollipops.",
  "str_quest_chat_16865005": "I get irritated at the thought of not getting to have any more lollipops.",
  "str_quest_chat_16865006": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_16865007": "I'll buy more when I'm in Umbraton next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_16865008": "But that'll probably take another two or three days...",
  "str_quest_chat_16865009": "Argh... Never mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_16865010": "I'll just clock in a couple more hours of boxing to take my mind off it.",
  "str_quest_chat_16866001": "Do you often take midday naps?",
  "str_quest_chat_16866002": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_16866003": "I usually get a second wind after lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_16866004": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_16866005": "I always have all kinds of stuff to do, so I've never had a chance for napping to become a habit.",
  "str_quest_chat_16866006": "Afternoon naps are a good way to recover your energy quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_16866007": "But I never sleep during the daytime.",
  "str_quest_chat_16866008": "Because if you want to sleep, you can just sleep any time, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_16866009": "... What a laid-back life.",
  "str_quest_chat_16867001": "Hmm... Half the day is over already.",
  "str_quest_chat_16867002": "It's time to perk yourself up a little!",
  "str_quest_chat_16867003": "You only think about perk up until now?!",
  "str_quest_chat_16867004": "Huh? Can I...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16867005": "Of course you can!",
  "str_quest_chat_16867006": "At least it's better than lazing about all day.",
  "str_quest_chat_16867007": "Well, every day is the same anyway!",
  "str_quest_chat_16868001": "Ugh!",
  "str_quest_chat_16868002": "What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_16868003": "My lollipop fell on the ground!",
  "str_quest_chat_16868004": "Ah! What should I do!?",
  "str_quest_chat_16868005": "Uh-oh, Tessa is about to go rampage!",
  "str_quest_chat_16868006": "Without lollipops, life has no meaning! Ah—",
  "str_quest_chat_16868007": "Fortunately, I brought a spare lollipop, so don't worry.",
  "str_quest_chat_16868008": "Well, that was easy...",
  "str_quest_chat_16869001": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_16869002": "Good afternoon, Tessa!",
  "str_quest_chat_16869003": "Hmm... It's a beautiful day.",
  "str_quest_chat_16869004": "I'm counting how many clouds have just passed in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_16869005": "I'm up to twenty-three!",
  "str_quest_chat_16869006": "Have you been counting all morning!?",
  "str_quest_chat_16869007": "I really envy your chilled-out lifestyle...",
  "str_quest_chat_16942001": "Any new cloak lying around? I need a big one.",
  "str_quest_chat_16942002": "Well, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_16942003": "But I see there're more wounds on you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16942004": "Is it because of that...",
  "str_quest_chat_16942005": "Oh, no, it isn't. Don't worry about me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16942006": "Are you sure it will be fine?",
  "str_quest_chat_16942007": "I'm fine, no worries...",
  "str_quest_chat_16942008": "While you say that...",
  "str_quest_chat_16942009": "I really am fine, and you shouldn't get close to me if at all possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_16942010": "But why? Do you not like me?",
  "str_quest_chat_16942011": "No, I'm afraid I'd hurt you...",
  "str_quest_chat_16942012": "What do you mean by that?",
  "str_quest_chat_16942013": "You'll find out later.",
  "str_quest_chat_16961001": "Good afternoon. Got a favor to ask of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_16961002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_16961003": "My cloak is ripped again. Can you mend it?",
  "str_quest_chat_16961004": "Again?",
  "str_quest_chat_16961005": "I-I'm sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat_16962001": "Thank you, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_16962002": "H-Huh? Why are you thanking me, all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_16962003": "Not only do you not hate me...",
  "str_quest_chat_16962004": "You're even letting me stay aboard the Colossus... So thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_16962005": "Don't say that! Besides, why would I hate you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16962006": "You don't have to be so polite anymore, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_16962007": "I... I still want to express my gratitude as much as I can...",
  "str_quest_chat_16962008": "It's not easy for me... to make friends...",
  "str_quest_chat_16962009": "That's why I really cherish our friendship...",
  "str_quest_chat_16962010": "Then I should thank you too, Areia!",
  "str_quest_chat_16962011": "Huh? B-But why...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16962012": "For choosing to join us on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_16962013": "And... for choosing to be my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_16962014": "...Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_16962015": "Now go get some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_16962016": "Okay... Thank you, again!",
  "str_quest_chat_16963001": "Do you have some free time, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16963002": "Sure, Areia. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_16963003": "Nothing, really...",
  "str_quest_chat_16963004": "I just wanted to ask if you've eaten lunch...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16963005": "Yeah, I already did.",
  "str_quest_chat_16963006": "... Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_16963007": "Not yet, no.",
  "str_quest_chat_16963008": "What's the matter, Areia?",
  "str_quest_chat_16963009": "Do you think today's lunch tasted bad, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_16963010": "Don't worry, I promise I'll take care of this.",
  "str_quest_chat_16963011": "No, it's not that... I wanted to show you my gratitude for taking me in...",
  "str_quest_chat_16963012": "So today... I went to help make lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_16963013": "But it looks like... It tasted awful...",
  "str_quest_chat_16963014": "I'm so sorry! I'm really, truly sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat_16963015": "Today's lunch tasted great! Honest!",
  "str_quest_chat_16963016": "I know... You're just saying that to make me feel better...",
  "str_quest_chat_16963017": "But I'll keep trying my best... I promise...",
  "str_quest_chat_16964001": "Uh, good afternoon, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_16964002": "Afternoon, Areia. What can I do for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_16964003": "Pardon me, but could you lend me some needle and thread...",
  "str_quest_chat_16964004": "Is there something you need to sew?",
  "str_quest_chat_16964005": "My cloak. I ripped it again...",
  "str_quest_chat_16964006": "Your cloak is torn again?",
  "str_quest_chat_16964007": "Y-Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_16964008": "I didn't want to trouble you...",
  "str_quest_chat_16964009": "But I used up all my thread and still couldn't mend it...",
  "str_quest_chat_16964010": "All right... I'll sew it for you in a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat_16964011": "Sorry to trouble you...",
  "str_quest_chat_16965001": "It's noon now.",
  "str_quest_chat_16965002": "Have you had lunch, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16965003": "Yep...",
  "str_quest_chat_16965004": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_16965005": "Please make sure you eat on time whenever you can.",
  "str_quest_chat_16965006": "Staying healthy is extremely important...",
  "str_quest_chat_16966001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16966002": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_16966003": "It's the perfect time for a cup of mellow coffee to welcome in the afternoon's work.",
  "str_quest_chat_16966004": "I have a mission to handle this afternoon. It looks like today is going to be very busy...",
  "str_quest_chat_16966005": "Oh, you have a new job, Areia?",
  "str_quest_chat_16966006": "It's not a stable job, but I'll do it as best I can to obtain more information.",
  "str_quest_chat_16966007": "I believe that one day, we will find a way to remove the curse...",
  "str_quest_chat_16966008": "I know we will!",
  "str_quest_chat_16967001": "Do you have some free time, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16967002": "What's the matter, Areia?",
  "str_quest_chat_16967003": "I'm wondering whether to eat sandwiches or salad for lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat_16967004": "What do you think, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_16967005": "Sandwiches.",
  "str_quest_chat_16967006": "Salad.",
  "str_quest_chat_16967007": "Ah, okay!",
  "str_quest_chat_16967008": "Well, if that's your suggestion, Navigator, I'll choose this one...",
  "str_quest_chat_16968001": "There's plenty of sunlight today, but my wounds are still aching...",
  "str_quest_chat_16968002": "Are you all right, Areia?",
  "str_quest_chat_16968003": "I'm fine, don't worry about me.",
  "str_quest_chat_16968004": "Actually, I'm used to living with these thorns a long time ago...",
  "str_quest_chat_16968005": "It's just that new black spots appear on my body every now and then, so it can be quite uncomfortable at times...",
  "str_quest_chat_16968006": "I promise, I'll try to help you find a way to get rid of that curse, Areia!",
  "str_quest_chat_16968007": "Thanks, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16968008": "I feel a warmth in my heart... It's almost as if... I no longer feel any pain.",
  "str_quest_chat_16969001": "The sun is so warming.",
  "str_quest_chat_16969002": "Are you taking in the sun in your room, Areia?",
  "str_quest_chat_16969003": "Yeah! I can get plenty of warm sunlight at home too.",
  "str_quest_chat_16969004": "With my magic sword at my side, I feel completely relaxed.",
  "str_quest_chat_16969005": "Not going out for a walk?",
  "str_quest_chat_16969006": "If I go out, I might accidentally stab someone...",
  "str_quest_chat_16969007": "If it's not absolutely necessary to go out, it'd be best for me to stay at home.",
  "str_quest_chat_16969008": "So it's about the curse... But, I think this is also due to your kind nature, Areia.",
  "str_quest_chat_16981001": "Good evening, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16981002": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_16981003": "Do you like chatting on the terminals?",
  "str_quest_chat_16981004": "Well, they let me keep in contact with my friends, even if they're miles away...",
  "str_quest_chat_16981005": "So I guess you could say that I like using them, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_16981006": "That's great! I-I like using them, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_16981007": "Although, if you ever feel like chatting with me...",
  "str_quest_chat_16981008": "You can just come and see me whenever you'd like.",
  "str_quest_chat_16981009": "No... I still can't get too close to you...",
  "str_quest_chat_16981010": "Not until the curse is lifted...",
  "str_quest_chat_16981011": "I'm sorry... I've said too much, haven't I...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16981012": "I'll stop bothering you during your time off, now...",
  "str_quest_chat_16981013": "Have a good night, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_16981014": "...Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_16982001": "Hey, Navigator? Could you chat with me for a little while before bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_16982002": "Of course! What do you want to talk about?",
  "str_quest_chat_16982003": "Can we talk about... Our friends?",
  "str_quest_chat_16982004": "You see... I don't have many friends...",
  "str_quest_chat_16982005": "Honestly, I'm a little jealous of all the friends you have...",
  "str_quest_chat_16982006": "But you're so kind and considerate of others, Areia...",
  "str_quest_chat_16982007": "I can't see why you wouldn't have lots of friends, either!",
  "str_quest_chat_16982008": "But... I'm cursed...",
  "str_quest_chat_16982009": "And I have these thorns growing all over my body...",
  "str_quest_chat_16982010": "I'm sure everyone is scared... of how I look...",
  "str_quest_chat_16982011": "I'm not afraid of you at all, Areia.",
  "str_quest_chat_16982012": "And I'm certain the others aboard the Colossus aren't afraid of you, either.",
  "str_quest_chat_16982013": "Besides, we're already friends, aren't we?",
  "str_quest_chat_16982014": "R... Really...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16982015": "Of course, we are! And if you still don't believe me...",
  "str_quest_chat_16982016": "You can strike up a conversation with anyone on board, and see for yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_16982017": "I'm sure everyone will accept you just the way you are!",
  "str_quest_chat_16982018": "Thank you... I-I'll give it a try.",
  "str_quest_chat_16983001": "Hey, Navigator... Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_16983002": "Not yet. Did you need something, Areia?",
  "str_quest_chat_16983003": "I... I have good news to share with you!",

  "str_quest_chat_16983005": "I... I greeted lots of people today...",
  "str_quest_chat_16983006": "And then... We all spent the whole day playing together!",
  "str_quest_chat_16983007": "\"We all\"? It sounds like you made more than one friend today!",
  "str_quest_chat_16983008": "I did! Even though they all look exactly alike...",
  "str_quest_chat_16983009": "They're small... And round... And love to fly around...",
  "str_quest_chat_16983010": "Wait, you're not talking about the Fireflies, are you...?",
  "str_quest_chat_16983011": "What exactly... Did you do with them today?",
  "str_quest_chat_16983012": "We cleaned up every single room in the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_16983013": "That's great, and I'm glad you had fun, but... I wouldn't exactly call that playing together...",
  "str_quest_chat_16984001": "Good evening, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16984002": "You're still up?",
  "str_quest_chat_16984003": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_16984004": "Need help with anything?",
  "str_quest_chat_16984005": "Eh? No... not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_16984006": "I'm just here to say good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_16984007": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_16984008": "Good night to you then, Areia.",
  "str_quest_chat_16984009": "Good night, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16985001": "I've completed... all tasks for today.",
  "str_quest_chat_16985002": "Wow, that's unbelievable, Areia!",
  "str_quest_chat_16985003": "It's just my way of making a living...",
  "str_quest_chat_16985004": "Great job, Areia!",
  "str_quest_chat_16985005": "I'm used to it. It's nothing, really.",
  "str_quest_chat_16985006": "I'm just here to... share this with you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16985007": "Oh, I understand how you feel, Areia.",
  "str_quest_chat_16985008": "Since you've completed all your tasks. How about turning in early?",
  "str_quest_chat_16985009": "Yes... Good night, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_16985010": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_17001001": "...",

  "str_quest_chat_17001007": "It's better putting the ellipsis together like this.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001008": "Did you accidentally press the end?",
  "str_quest_chat_17001009": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001010": "I just think it's better to put the ellipsis together like this.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001011": "That's the Sariel I know.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001012": "Also, I need to ask you a favor.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001013": "Alright...",
  "str_quest_chat_17001031": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_17001032": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_17001033": "Just give it to me straight.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001034": "I went to see the Shadowlord again, imploring him to find out more about Gabriel and Amos.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001035": "I did get new information in exchange for three months of free labor.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001036": "You're too naive, Sariel.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001037": "I think so too, since the news was especially depressing.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001038": "I don't think I can find out more from Gabriel.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001039": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_17001040": "According to the Shadowlord...",
  "str_quest_chat_17001041": "Gabriel lost her memory.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001042": "She completely forgot what happened ten years ago.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001043": "This is straight out of a fiction.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001044": "I think I heard about it before.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001045": "Sorry, I got to get to work. Two more tasks still await.",
  "str_quest_chat_17001046": "Goodbye. I shall strive to unearth the truth behind my grandfather's death!",
  "str_quest_chat_17001047": "May luck be with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17041001": "I'm here. It looks safe from here.",
  "str_quest_chat_17041002": "I've heard stories about Sariel getting cheated.",
  "str_quest_chat_17041003": "Don't worry, there's no scammer here.",
  "str_quest_chat_17041004": "That's not what I'm worried about.",
  "str_quest_chat_17041005": "It's...",
  "str_quest_chat_17041006": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_17041007": "The armrests on the chair in my room aren't even, and it's killing me!",
  "str_quest_chat_17041008": "Can't you fix it?",
  "str_quest_chat_17041009": "Uh, not right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_17041010": "I could try...",
  "str_quest_chat_17041011": "I can't wait. I got to do it now.",
  "str_quest_chat_17041012": "No, wait, what are you doing... Stop!",
  "str_quest_chat_17051001": "What a nice morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_17051002": "The light is coming in through the window at just the right angle...",
  "str_quest_chat_17051003": "Leaving a nice, warm spot on the floor.",
  "str_quest_chat_17051004": "You picked a good place to park the Colossus, Navigator. Thanks for that!",
  "str_quest_chat_17051005": "Don't mention it!",
  "str_quest_chat_17051006": "Although, I wasn't trying for any particular angle...",
  "str_quest_chat_17051007": "If you could face the Colossus towards the sun like this all the time...",
  "str_quest_chat_17051008": "I'd really appreciate it, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_17051009": "That would be a bit of a challenge...",
  "str_quest_chat_17052001": "Good morning, Navigator! You awake yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_17052002": "Yeah, but I'm still a little sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_17052003": "Huh, sounds like your alarm clock isn't doing the trick.",
  "str_quest_chat_17052004": "Do you have any better ideas?",
  "str_quest_chat_17052005": "Hmm... You should get a cat. A black cat, if possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_17052006": "I don't get it...",
  "str_quest_chat_17052007": "You're starting to sound a lot like me, you know that?",
  "str_quest_chat_17052008": "It's like... Cats have a habit of walking all over your face every morning, at the same time.",
  "str_quest_chat_17052009": "They like to purr and meow a lot while they're doing it, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_17052010": "When you open your eyes to see the cute, little ball of fluff in front of you...",
  "str_quest_chat_17052011": "I promise you won't want to go back to bed anytime soon!",
  "str_quest_chat_17052012": "Well, it makes sense when you put it that way...",
  "str_quest_chat_17052013": "But what does any of that have to do with specifically getting a black cat?",
  "str_quest_chat_17053001": "It's morning again, my favorite time of the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17053002": "Because of the brilliant sunlight?",
  "str_quest_chat_17053003": "Because the temperature is pleasant?",
  "str_quest_chat_17053004": "No, because of the balance!",
  "str_quest_chat_17053005": "The moment the sun rises and sets, the day is divided into two symmetrical parts, day and night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17053006": "Flawless and everlasting.",
  "str_quest_chat_17053007": "But... light and darkness aren't exactly the same, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_17053008": "That's...",
  "str_quest_chat_17053009": "And in different times throughout the year...",
  "str_quest_chat_17053010": "The length of day and night also varies slightly.",
  "str_quest_chat_17053011": "Stop it! That's enough!",
  "str_quest_chat_17054001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_17054002": "The coffee on the Colossus is great!",
  "str_quest_chat_17054003": "I'm glad you like it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17054004": "But we could do with some kitchen scales.",
  "str_quest_chat_17054005": "Do you need scales to make coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat_17054006": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_17054007": "What're you going to do with it?",
  "str_quest_chat_17054008": "I need to weigh out the coffee and milk.",
  "str_quest_chat_17054009": "An equal ratio of each is best.",
  "str_quest_chat_17055001": "What a nice morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_17055002": "It would be even better if we could have a hot breakfast...",
  "str_quest_chat_17055003": "So, are you going to go buy breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_17055004": "N-No...",
  "str_quest_chat_17055005": "That way, I won't have money for lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat_17055006": "These last few coins... I have to spend them well.",
  "str_quest_chat_17055007": "That sounds really tough, Sariel...",
  "str_quest_chat_17056001": "Good morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_17056002": "Good morning, Sariel.",
  "str_quest_chat_17056003": "I need to work today, so I got up early.",
  "str_quest_chat_17056004": "Hmm... That's to say... I can make some money today...",
  "str_quest_chat_17056005": "How much can I save? I'm not sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_17056006": "Are you sure you're okay, Sariel?",
  "str_quest_chat_17056007": "You won't let anyone cheat you, will you?",
  "str_quest_chat_17056008": "Don't worry, I'm already completely broke...",
  "str_quest_chat_17056009": "I'm off... Goodbye...",
  "str_quest_chat_17057001": "Is it... morning right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_17057002": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_17057003": "Oh, so it's not dusk, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_17057004": "The sky looks really similar when its growing dark and when it's getting bright...",
  "str_quest_chat_17057005": "Once I thought it was almost dawn and went out to buy food—",
  "str_quest_chat_17057006": "The shopkeeper had already left work because it was getting late.",
  "str_quest_chat_17057007": "I can't tell if you're very lucky or very confused...",
  "str_quest_chat_17058001": "A new day has begun.",
  "str_quest_chat_17058002": "Good morning, Sariel.",
  "str_quest_chat_17058003": "How do you plan on spending your day, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_17058004": "No plans as of yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_17058005": "Same here...",
  "str_quest_chat_17058006": "I'm going to inspect the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_17058007": "That's not a bad idea...",
  "str_quest_chat_17058008": "Oh, I know what I'm going to do!",
  "str_quest_chat_17058009": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_17058010": "I should spend today devising a money-saving plan...",
  "str_quest_chat_17058011": "Write a work schedule...",
  "str_quest_chat_17058012": "That sounds great! After all, since you always seem so confused...",
  "str_quest_chat_17058013": "Deciding to write up a schedule is a great mark of progress!",
  "str_quest_chat_17059001": "Erm... I accidentally broke a glass while drinking water this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_17059002": "But those shards of glass all over the place in a mess... Urgh... I can't stand it...",
  "str_quest_chat_17059003": "Why couldn't the glass break into a symmetrical pattern?",
  "str_quest_chat_17059004": "This isn't something most people worry about...",
  "str_quest_chat_17059005": "Has your obsessive-compulsive disorder moved up to the next level?",
  "str_quest_chat_17059006": "Erm... I don't know, has it?",
  "str_quest_chat_17059007": "Anyway, it's time to buy a new glass...",
  "str_quest_chat_17059008": "I'll just buy one with a symmetrical pattern. Oh, and the shape should also be symmetrical!",
  "str_quest_chat_17059009": "Yep, your obsessive-compulsive disorder has leveled up!",
  "str_quest_chat_17061001": "Are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_17061002": "I'm having lunch right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_17061003": "But can you come over really quick?",
  "str_quest_chat_17061004": "What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_17061005": "The blind is crooked and I can't stand it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17061006": "I can't right it myself, so come over now.",
  "str_quest_chat_17061007": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_17062001": "Afternoon! I got a question for you...",
  "str_quest_chat_17062002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_17062003": "Are we allowed to drink coffee served on the Colossus whenever we want?",
  "str_quest_chat_17062004": "Sorry, it's just that... I don't have any money, so...",
  "str_quest_chat_17062005": "Of course you can. It's free, so don't worry about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17062006": "Ah! My coffee god has appeared before me...!",
  "str_quest_chat_17062007": "You can add as much sugar as you want, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_17062008": "Do you like to add a lot of sugar to your coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat_17062009": "Of course! Otherwise, it's too bitter for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_17062010": "Is coffee with sugar... still really coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat_17062011": "Also, adding sugar to your coffee is an easy way to gain weight, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_17062012": "... O-Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_17062013": "No way, I drink my coffee black.",
  "str_quest_chat_17062014": "Ah, so you appreciate the true taste of coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat_17062015": "You really are a god of coffee!",
  "str_quest_chat_17062016": "That's going a bit far...",
  "str_quest_chat_17063001": "Afternoon, afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_17063002": "Has your compulsion gotten worse, Sariel?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17063003": "Uh-huh! Uh-huh!",
  "str_quest_chat_17063004": "Go on and rest, I've got to figure out this speech pattern of mine.",
  "str_quest_chat_17063005": "Long sentence symmetry seems quite difficult. It's best to start with short sentences.",
  "str_quest_chat_17063006": "Afternoon, noonafter!",
  "str_quest_chat_17063007": "... Afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_17064001": "Mmm. Lunch today was perfect.",
  "str_quest_chat_17064002": "It sure was delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat_17064003": "The meat was so tender and perfectly seasoned.",
  "str_quest_chat_17064004": "No, that's not the important thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_17064005": "The most important thing was the symmetry of the dishes.",
  "str_quest_chat_17101001": "Thank you for the new room!",
  "str_quest_chat_17101002": "Dr. Corax! Did you find it suitable?",
  "str_quest_chat_17101003": "It's nice, except the restroom is a bit distant...",
  "str_quest_chat_17101004": "And another thing, please don't call me Doctor.",
  "str_quest_chat_17101005": "Oh, sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat_17101006": "Is the restroom not close? I thought it was two doors down...",
  "str_quest_chat_17101007": "Not very distant, but it's not convenient going back and forth.",
  "str_quest_chat_17101008": "Why do you need to go back and forth?",
  "str_quest_chat_17101009": "Because I have to.",
  "str_quest_chat_17101010": "Was it something in the lunch you ate?",
  "str_quest_chat_17101011": "What are you talking about? I went to wash my hands.",
  "str_quest_chat_17101012": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_17101013": "But why would you wash your hands so often?",
  "str_quest_chat_17161001": "Yo, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_17161002": "Corax? This is a surprise...",
  "str_quest_chat_17161003": "What, not excited to see me?",
  "str_quest_chat_17161004": "Of course, I am...",
  "str_quest_chat_17161005": "I just never hear from you, is all.",
  "str_quest_chat_17161006": "You're right, I'm not a big fan of chatting through messages.",
  "str_quest_chat_17161007": "I just came by because I wanted to say thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_17161008": "Huh? Thanks for what?",
  "str_quest_chat_17161009": "For keeping the Colossus so clean and hygienic.",
  "str_quest_chat_17161010": "I'm sure it's all thanks to you and the hard work you put into it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17161011": "You're welcome, but actually...",
  "str_quest_chat_17161012": "Most of the credit should go to the Fireflies for cleaning the Colossus so well.",
  "str_quest_chat_17161013": "Speaking of the little buggers...",
  "str_quest_chat_17161014": "Is there any way you can have them wash off with disinfectant before they start cleaning?",
  "str_quest_chat_17161015": "Some people might feel uncomfortable if they don't clean themselves first, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_17161016": "I... I'll think about it. Thanks for the suggestion.",
  "str_quest_chat_17161017": "If you're serious about it, I'm willing to do it for you for free.",
  "str_quest_chat_17161018": "Th-That won't be necessary...",
  "str_quest_chat_17162001": "Got a minute, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_17162002": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162003": "I just had my lunch and now I'm going to take a nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162004": "There's something I would like to ask you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162005": "Recently, have you experienced symptoms such as cough, fever, or gastrointestinal discomfort?",
  "str_quest_chat_17162006": "I have not.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162007": "I'm healthy as a horse! No discomfort in any form.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162008": "Well, that's great.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162009": "I do feel a little under the weather...",
  "str_quest_chat_17162010": "Perhaps I've stayed up late a little too much recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_17162011": "Is that so? Please be sure to rest earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162012": "I will. Staying up late really harms the body...",
  "str_quest_chat_17162013": "But why are you suddenly asking this out of the blue?",
  "str_quest_chat_17162014": "I've noticed that many Aurorians have been having health problems over the past few days.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162015": "It's probably the weather.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162016": "If you don't rest and hydrate properly, small problems like these can turn into big problems due to negligence.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162017": "That's why I want to remind you to take care of your health.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162018": "Don't worry, I will keep that in mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162019": "Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_17162020": "Well, then, I'll leave you to take your nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_17162021": "And sweet dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_17163001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_17163002": "Afternoon! It's rare to see you at this time of year.",
  "str_quest_chat_17163003": "You're right. I've just finished a mission and on my way to rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_17163004": "Sure enough, it's all in a day's work for an assassin!",
  "str_quest_chat_17164001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_17164002": "Are you on break?",
  "str_quest_chat_17164003": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_17164004": "Had a busy morning and finally got some time off.",
  "str_quest_chat_17164005": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_17164006": "Too many things on the plate to take one...",
  "str_quest_chat_17164007": "Breaks can make you more productive and healthy.",
  "str_quest_chat_17164008": "I won't disturb you, then. Have a great afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_17164009": "You too, Corax.",
  "str_quest_chat_17165001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_17165002": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_17165003": "The weather's pretty good here. How is it over where you are?",
  "str_quest_chat_17165004": "It's a fine, sunny day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17165005": "Sounds like bad weather... It's rainy here. I love it!",
  "str_quest_chat_17165006": "I guess your perception of the weather is different from mine...",
  "str_quest_chat_17166001": "Good afternoon. Have you eaten lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_17166002": "Yep...",
  "str_quest_chat_17166003": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_17166004": "You need to eat regular meals if you want to stay healthy.",
  "str_quest_chat_17166005": "Although I'm no longer a doctor, I still care about this kind of thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_17166006": "Hmm... Must be some kind of basic living habit.",
  "str_quest_chat_17166007": "Okay, thank you for reminding me!",
  "str_quest_chat_17167001": "Half the day has already passed.",
  "str_quest_chat_17167002": "Yeah, today has gone by very quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_17167003": "What do you plan on doing this afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_17167004": "I'm going to tend to my blade.",
  "str_quest_chat_17167005": "A sharp lancet can make a bigger impact on the battlefield.",
  "str_quest_chat_17167006": "I can't get this image of you wiping off a scalpel out of my mind...",
  "str_quest_chat_17168001": "It's noon. So far, I have washed my hands twenty-three times today.",
  "str_quest_chat_17168002": "That's less than my average number of times in half a day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17168003": "In other words, my germaphobia issue has become better recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_17168004": "It sounds like you're still washing your hands a lot more than the average person...",
  "str_quest_chat_17168005": "Really? The thing is, washing my hands over and over again soothes me.",
  "str_quest_chat_17168006": "After all, it's impossible to know whether the blood that so often covers my hands is contaminated.",
  "str_quest_chat_17168007": "I guess your extreme cleanliness is actually just doctorly caution...",
  "str_quest_chat_17241001": "How are you, I'm Cuscuta.",
  "str_quest_chat_17241002": "Nice to meet you. Hope we'll get along very well.",
  "str_quest_chat_17241003": "Hmm, I guess that's how it goes.",
  "str_quest_chat_17241004": "What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_17241005": "Is that what you say when meeting someone for the first time?",
  "str_quest_chat_17241006": "Generally, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_17241007": "But not always.",
  "str_quest_chat_17241008": "Take me, for instance, just a hello will do.",
  "str_quest_chat_17241009": "Can you teach me?",
  "str_quest_chat_17241010": "This is rather unexpected and I don't know what to say...",
  "str_quest_chat_17241011": "Anyway, just greeting them.",
  "str_quest_chat_17241012": "I think I got it. How are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_17241013": "I'm fine, thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17241014": "So this is how you greet people.",
  "str_quest_chat_17241015": "It sounds okay but something feels off...",
  "str_quest_chat_17251001": "Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_17251002": "Good morning, Cuscuta!",
  "str_quest_chat_17251003": "Good... Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_17251004": "I see... So this is how people usually greet each other in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_17251005": "Usually, but there isn't really a rule that says you have to say it just like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_17251006": "As long as you express your feelings, that's all that matters.",
  "str_quest_chat_17251007": "For example, you can just say \"Morning!\" if you want to.",
  "str_quest_chat_17251008": "I... I understand. Allow me to... try again.",
  "str_quest_chat_17251009": "Navigator... \"Morning!\" if you want to.",
  "str_quest_chat_17251010": "I... Think you might have misunderstood a little.",
  "str_quest_chat_17251011": "Expressing my own feelings... It is not very easy to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_17261001": "Good... Afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_17261002": "Cuscuta... You learned how to greet people!",
  "str_quest_chat_17261003": "I couldn't afford to fail... Not after receiving your kindness...",
  "str_quest_chat_17261004": "That's why... I have been practicing a lot.",
  "str_quest_chat_17261005": "This is a wonderful start!",
  "str_quest_chat_17261006": "It's... Still not enough... I still have a long ways to go...",
  "str_quest_chat_17261007": "Oh... Right... Do you have anything to tell me?",
  "str_quest_chat_17261008": "Eh? Uh... L-Let me think...",
  "str_quest_chat_17261009": "Are you going on break soon?",
  "str_quest_chat_17261010": "I am.",
  "str_quest_chat_17261011": "Have you eaten lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_17261012": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_17261013": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_17261014": "Is there anything else?",
  "str_quest_chat_17261015": "N-Not at the moment, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_17261016": "But I read... that I must practice listening to other people speak...",
  "str_quest_chat_17261017": "If you don't speak... How can I listen...?",
  "str_quest_chat_17261018": "Wh-Why don't we just keep working on greetings instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_17261019": "Very well... Have a nice day, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_17261020": "You, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_17262001": "Good afternoon... Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_17262002": "Today's lunch was delicious. I am happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_17262003": "Haha.",
  "str_quest_chat_17262004": "Cuscuta, are you... trying to be happy?",
  "str_quest_chat_17262005": "A-Ahem... I'm glad you enjoyed the food, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_17262006": "You're the only one who thinks the food tasted good today.",
  "str_quest_chat_17262007": "Could it be that... I made another mistake...?",
  "str_quest_chat_17262008": "Why would you say that?",
  "str_quest_chat_17262009": "Because... I have no way of telling if food tastes good or bad...",
  "str_quest_chat_17262010": "I just wanted to practice on... how to express happiness...",
  "str_quest_chat_17262011": "But I still don't understand... What happiness is...",
  "str_quest_chat_17262012": "Well, your body's first reaction to something can usually tell you everything you need to know.",
  "str_quest_chat_17262013": "For example, when I heard you say good afternoon to me just now...",
  "str_quest_chat_17262014": "I felt happy and, without thinking about it, my face began to smile.",
  "str_quest_chat_17262015": "Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_17262016": "Haha.",
  "str_quest_chat_17263001": "It's noon...",
  "str_quest_chat_17263002": "Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_17263003": "Yeah, I'm here.",
  "str_quest_chat_17263004": "Did you...",
  "str_quest_chat_17263005": "Did you have... a good lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_17263006": "I'll take that as a greeting.",
  "str_quest_chat_17263007": "Yes, I did.",
  "str_quest_chat_17263008": "Thanks for the thought, Cuscuta.",
  "str_quest_chat_17263009": "Well.",
  "str_quest_chat_17263010": "I see you can greet others like this... for noontime.",
  "str_quest_chat_17263011": "I must... practice more.",
  "str_quest_chat_17281001": "It's late. Are you asleep, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_17281002": "I'm a little tired and about to turn in.",
  "str_quest_chat_17281003": "Do you want to sleep with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_17281004": "???",
  "str_quest_chat_17281005": "You're invited to try the new custom coffin.",
  "str_quest_chat_17281006": "Uh, it's quite all right...",
  "str_quest_chat_17282001": "I see you're still up, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_17282002": "Are you like me and don't need any sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_17282003": "Yes, sleeping is overrated.",
  "str_quest_chat_17282004": "As long as I can spend more time gaming...",
  "str_quest_chat_17282005": "Who needs sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_17282006": "No, I'm actually really sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_17282007": "But to finish this interesting game as soon as possible...",
  "str_quest_chat_17282008": "I can stay up all night!",
  "str_quest_chat_17282009": "What a strange sentiment.",
  "str_quest_chat_17282010": "But there is a curse that is eating away at you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17282011": "Huh...?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17282012": "Exhaustion and fatigue will accelerate the spread of the curse.",
  "str_quest_chat_17282013": "Eventually, it will turn into thorns that take root and sprout in your body.",
  "str_quest_chat_17282014": "Is there any way to undo the curse...?",
  "str_quest_chat_17282015": "To undo the curse, you must rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_17282016": "Please remember that you and I are different. I don't need to sleep, but you do.",
  "str_quest_chat_17282017": "I, I understand...",
  "str_quest_chat_17282018": "I'll go to bed immediately...",
  "str_quest_chat_17283001": "Something smells good today.",
  "str_quest_chat_17283002": "What smells good?",
  "str_quest_chat_17283003": "... in the coffin.",
  "str_quest_chat_17283004": "W-wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_17283005": "What do you smell in the coffin?",
  "str_quest_chat_17283006": "The smell of new wood.",
  "str_quest_chat_17283007": "Whew...",
  "str_quest_chat_17283008": "You almost gave me a heart attack, Cuscuta.",
  "str_quest_chat_17283009": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17283010": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17284001": "The night is here.",
  "str_quest_chat_17284002": "Good evening, Cuscuta.",
  "str_quest_chat_17284003": "Erm... Should I also say... good evening?",
  "str_quest_chat_17284004": "Uh, it seems you're not used to common greetings...",
  "str_quest_chat_17284005": "Sorry, I don't know much about Aurorian communication habits.",
  "str_quest_chat_17284006": "But, I will study hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_17284007": "You'll get there, I promise...",
  "str_quest_chat_17285001": "It's getting late.",
  "str_quest_chat_17285002": "Erm, it's already evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_17285003": "Yikes! I haven't finished my work for today!",
  "str_quest_chat_17285004": "Why don't you just leave your unfinished work for tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat_17285005": "Why do you seem so agitated, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_17285006": "Erm, because I have things to do tomorrow, I don't want this to ruin my plans.",
  "str_quest_chat_17285007": "I really can't put it off until tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_17285008": "The reason I seem so surprised is that... I lost track of what time it was.",
  "str_quest_chat_17285009": "Really? I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_17285010": "Do you really understand, Cuscuta?",
  "str_quest_chat_17286001": "It's getting dark.",
  "str_quest_chat_17286002": "I completed today's quests, erm, before the day got dark anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_17286003": "Not bad, but wasn't your quest—",
  "str_quest_chat_17286004": "—a punishment?",
  "str_quest_chat_17286005": "Right. The flowers are so beautiful today. I picked them so carefully.",
  "str_quest_chat_17286006": "Would you like one, Navigator? I can give one to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17286007": "You mean these flowers growing off of rotting corpses?",
  "str_quest_chat_17286008": "That's gonna be a no from me...",
  "str_quest_chat_17286009": "Hmm? You don't need it? Fine...",
  "str_quest_chat_17287001": "Ready for bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_17287002": "I'm not sleepy yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_17287003": "I'm getting ready to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_17287004": "Normal people go to bed after nightfall.",
  "str_quest_chat_17287005": "However, my routine seems to be quite abnormal.",
  "str_quest_chat_17287006": "Your entire deal is abnormal...",
  "str_quest_chat_17287007": "Sometimes I wake up in my black coffin as if I've been sleeping for eternity.",
  "str_quest_chat_17287008": "I think I'm a night animal.",
  "str_quest_chat_17287009": "The night is always silent—",
  "str_quest_chat_17287010": "Right... It's really quite in keeping with your personality.",
  "str_quest_chat_17351001": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_17351002": "Morning, Leah. It's hot today!",
  "str_quest_chat_17351003": "Oh, that's because I released the steam.",
  "str_quest_chat_17351004": "I heard today's going to be cooler than usual and I didn't want you to get cold.",
  "str_quest_chat_17351005": "I appreciate it, but it wasn't cold at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_17352001": "Good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_17352002": "Good morning, Leah!",
  "str_quest_chat_17352003": "Hey Navigator... Wh-What did you think of the breakfast this morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_17352004": "Hmm... It was fine, I guess? I didn't really notice anything different...",
  "str_quest_chat_17352005": "Did you make breakfast today, Leah?",
  "str_quest_chat_17352006": "N-No... I just made some small adjustments, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat_17352007": "I went into the kitchen this morning, and someone left the milk on the stove... It was completely dry, and so were the eggs...",
  "str_quest_chat_17352008": "I don't know who did it, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_17352009": "I decided to steam them both, to bring them closer to their original states.",
  "str_quest_chat_17352010": "I see... Thank you, Leah!",
  "str_quest_chat_17352011": "Although...",
  "str_quest_chat_17352012": "I'm pretty sure I know who was in charge of making breakfast today.",
  "str_quest_chat_17353001": "Morning, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_17353002": "Morning! You rise early, Leah.",
  "str_quest_chat_17353003": "I like the breeze in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_17353004": "It's like a soft, warm hand caressing my face, with pleasant moisture in the air...",
  "str_quest_chat_17353005": "That does sound very comforting.",
  "str_quest_chat_17353006": "Yes. You should experience it sometime, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_17353007": "Okay, got it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17354001": "It rained last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17354002": "The air this morning is full of moisture, and you can even see a rainbow.",
  "str_quest_chat_17354003": "That sounds wonderful.",
  "str_quest_chat_17354004": "I once tried to simulate rain and create a rainbow with steam vapor.",
  "str_quest_chat_17354005": "Were you successful?",
  "str_quest_chat_17354006": "Nope...",
  "str_quest_chat_17355001": "Good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_17355002": "Good morning, Leah.",
  "str_quest_chat_17355003": "Out of all the times of day, I like morning the most.",
  "str_quest_chat_17355004": "Hmm... Why is that?",
  "str_quest_chat_17355005": "Because it's always misty in the morning, I really like it...",
  "str_quest_chat_17355006": "Oh, yeah, it's really foggy in the morning... And there's always dew on the plants here.",
  "str_quest_chat_17355007": "It really matches your aura.",
  "str_quest_chat_17356001": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_17356002": "Are you up?",
  "str_quest_chat_17356003": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_17356004": "S-Sorry. Did I bother you?",
  "str_quest_chat_17356005": "I'm awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_17356006": "Good. I'm glad I didn't bother you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17356007": "What's up, Leah?",
  "str_quest_chat_17356008": "N-Nothing, I just want to greet you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17356009": "Wish you a smooth new day. That's all...",
  "str_quest_chat_17356010": "Okay, I have officially fully received your blessings.",
  "str_quest_chat_17357001": "It's time to start another day of patrolling...",
  "str_quest_chat_17357002": "You're up early, Leah.",
  "str_quest_chat_17357003": "Well, I'm used to patrolling every day...",
  "str_quest_chat_17357004": "As a patroller of Northland, this is my duty...",
  "str_quest_chat_17357005": "T-Though I'm still working on it...",
  "str_quest_chat_17357006": "Keep it up!",
  "str_quest_chat_17358001": "The morning snow is so beautiful. I love it, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_17358002": "But what?",
  "str_quest_chat_17358003": "I'm still looking forward to the spring...",
  "str_quest_chat_17358004": "When does spring land in Northland?",
  "str_quest_chat_17358005": "I wish I could see the green trees and the babbling streams...",
  "str_quest_chat_17358006": "It's really snowy all year round in Northland. It's impossible to see those things you just mentioned..",
  "str_quest_chat_17358007": "If you were not busy patrolling, you would have a chance to see spring in other places...",
  "str_quest_chat_17441001": "Not even an interrogation room with all the space on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_17441002": "Huh? Have you seen everything?",
  "str_quest_chat_17441003": "Made a few rounds, already.",
  "str_quest_chat_17441004": "That was fast!",
  "str_quest_chat_17441005": "I need an interrogation room, please.",
  "str_quest_chat_17441006": "What kind of room is that?",
  "str_quest_chat_17441007": "Where you keep all the torture devices, of course. Everybody knows that!",
  "str_quest_chat_17441008": "Okay, okay, my apologies. I'll get right to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17441009": "Wait a minute, everybody knows that?",
  "str_quest_chat_17461001": "Torturing people really works up a person's appetite, don't you agree?",
  "str_quest_chat_17461002": "Good afternoon, Eicy.",
  "str_quest_chat_17461003": "Uh... What does torture have to do with a person's appetite?",
  "str_quest_chat_17461004": "Here, just imagine it...",
  "str_quest_chat_17461005": "The smell of burning flesh, if you cut it open, you can see the moisture... Aren't they wonderful?",
  "str_quest_chat_17461006": "I-I don't think that kind of thing is good for anyone's appetite!",
  "str_quest_chat_17461007": "I don't think I can even eat my lunch anymore...",
  "str_quest_chat_17461008": "Why wouldn't you feel like eating lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_17461009": "After all, the steak is so tender and fresh!",
  "str_quest_chat_17461010": "It tastes especially good if I think of my work!",
  "str_quest_chat_17461011": "So juicy and well seasoned ... Delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_17461012": "What?! You were just talking about steak this whole time?",
  "str_quest_chat_17462001": "Cut open the skin then slice the muscle...",
  "str_quest_chat_17462002": "Eicy...?",
  "str_quest_chat_17462003": "Remove the veins and extract the bones...",
  "str_quest_chat_17462004": "Wh-What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_17462005": "Hit repeatedly with a sharp hammer...",
  "str_quest_chat_17462006": "This is terrifying!",
  "str_quest_chat_17462007": "Throw it into a pot of boiling oil...",
  "str_quest_chat_17462008": "Stop!",
  "str_quest_chat_17462009": "Oh, what are you so scared of?",
  "str_quest_chat_17462010": "I'm just making some fried ribs!",
  "str_quest_chat_17462011": "You're cooking!?",
  "str_quest_chat_17462012": "Look at you, shaking like that. It's so funny.",
  "str_quest_chat_17462013": "It's just as much fun as an interrogation.",
  "str_quest_chat_17462014": "You did this deliberately!",
  "str_quest_chat_17463001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_17463002": "Have you eaten lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_17463003": "Yep...",
  "str_quest_chat_17463004": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_17463005": "I see. So, who have you seen today?",
  "str_quest_chat_17463006": "Also, do you have any plans for the afternoon? How about the evening?",
  "str_quest_chat_17463007": "That's a lot of questions... I feel like I'm being interrogated, Eicy...",
  "str_quest_chat_17463008": "Oh, I'm sorry. It seems my penchant for interrogation has unconsciously seeped out onto you...",
  "str_quest_chat_17463009": "Heehee, I'll pay more attention next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_17464001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_17464002": "Good afternoon, Eicy.",
  "str_quest_chat_17464003": "I finished interrogating a prisoner this morning, and now I'm free.",
  "str_quest_chat_17464004": "But I broke another set of torture tongs. I guess I need to buy a new pair...",
  "str_quest_chat_17464005": "You b-broke them!?",
  "str_quest_chat_17464006": "What did you do that even an instrument of torture broke...?",
  "str_quest_chat_17464007": "I never thought I'd find myself sympathizing with a prisoner...",
  "str_quest_chat_17465001": "Ah, it's noon time!",
  "str_quest_chat_17465002": "You seem to be in a good mood, Eicy.",
  "str_quest_chat_17465003": "Yes, I feel very happy after hearing the prisoners moaning all morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_17465004": "It would be great if I could have prisoners who do what I want daily!",
  "str_quest_chat_17465005": "Umm...",
  "str_quest_chat_17465006": "I wish he could also put on a wonderful show in the afternoon for me to enjoy!",
  "str_quest_chat_17465007": "It sounds like you're talking about contestants, not prisoners...",
  "str_quest_chat_17466001": "This morning passed by so quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_17466002": "Yes, it's noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_17466003": "Are you busy today?",
  "str_quest_chat_17466004": "Well, regarding work, my job is very easy. There's nothing special about making people scream.",
  "str_quest_chat_17466005": "But Victoria made an appointment with me today. I'm looking forward to it!",
  "str_quest_chat_17466006": "I feel like time is speeding up!",
  "str_quest_chat_17466007": "Hmm, should I change my clothes? I want her to see me looking my best.",
  "str_quest_chat_17466008": "Yeah, you should get changed.",
  "str_quest_chat_17466009": "No, you don't need to.",
  "str_quest_chat_17466010": "Thinking about it, I can't let her see any blood on me! I'm going to change!",
  "str_quest_chat_17467001": "It's only noon now...",
  "str_quest_chat_17467002": "What about it?",
  "str_quest_chat_17467003": "Time just goes by so slowly. I didn't have any work to do in the morning. It was really boring.",
  "str_quest_chat_17467004": "I had to sit in the interrogation room, checking the list of past prisoners again and again...",
  "str_quest_chat_17467005": "Find anything...?",
  "str_quest_chat_17467006": "After the interrogation, one guy changed his ways and started living a good life.",
  "str_quest_chat_17467007": "I guess the torture tactics I used that day really worked!",
  "str_quest_chat_17467008": "I guess, when you put it like that, you did a good thing there...",
  "str_quest_chat_17467009": "After all, anyone who has experienced such a thing wouldn't want to hold on to such nightmarish memories...",
  "str_quest_chat_17481001": "This is boring. Get up.",
  "str_quest_chat_17481002": "It's late. Why won't you let me sleep?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17481003": "Because I'm bored. Tell me a story.",
  "str_quest_chat_17481004": "Are you still a kid who needs a bedtime story?",
  "str_quest_chat_17481005": "I'm not happy unless I torment you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17481006": "Spare me, please!",
  "str_quest_chat_17482001": "Hi! Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_17482002": "Not yet. Need something, Eicy?",
  "str_quest_chat_17482003": "That super expensive oil in the kitchen... There's none left.",
  "str_quest_chat_17482004": "All that's left is this ordinary cooking oil... I don't think I could even use this stuff to shine my shoes.",
  "str_quest_chat_17482005": "Uh... Eicy? Are you... cooking right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_17482006": "Otherwise, how would you know so much about our cooking oil reserves?",
  "str_quest_chat_17482007": "Me? Cook? Don't make me laugh!",
  "str_quest_chat_17482008": "I was using the expensive oil to shine my cane.",
  "str_quest_chat_17482009": "But like I said, we're all out of the stuff now... So you'd better order some more!",
  "str_quest_chat_17482010": "Ah, I can't wait to see my shiny cane in the morning sun tomorrow!",
  "str_quest_chat_17482011": "Th-That's wasteful, Eicy! You need to stop that right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_17483001": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_17483002": "Where can I feel a nice breeze on your Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_17483003": "Uh... The Bridge, I think.",
  "str_quest_chat_17483004": "Why do you ask, all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_17483005": "I wanted to hang-dry my blindfolds. It's late, so everyone is in their rooms.",
  "str_quest_chat_17483006": "I-I see... so you wash them yourself, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_17483007": "Unless you feel like washing them for me?",
  "str_quest_chat_17483008": "On one condition... If you dare to look me straight in the eyes...",
  "str_quest_chat_17483009": "Yeah... This sounds like a great idea to me!",
  "str_quest_chat_17483010": "Ahaha... Sorry, I don't think so...",
  "str_quest_chat_17484001": "Usually around this time, my torture chamber is full of such pleasant sounds...",
  "str_quest_chat_17484002": "You do interrogations this late at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_17484003": "Of course! I love it when people are able to keep up with me all day long...",
  "str_quest_chat_17484004": "Then I can see how much longer they can hold up!",
  "str_quest_chat_17484005": "Ugh... It feels like it's been ages since I last heard someone moan in despair... It's starting to make me restless...",
  "str_quest_chat_17484006": "Would you mind if I... tortured you a bit? Don't worry, I'll be nice and gentle...",
  "str_quest_chat_17484007": "N-No thanks! I-I-I...",
  "str_quest_chat_17484008": "I'm not the kind to break any rules! I swear!",
  "str_quest_chat_17484009": "Don't be so nervous... I was only joking!",
  "str_quest_chat_17484010": "I'm going to bed now. Maybe I'll hear one of those delightful moans in my dreams tonight...?",
  "str_quest_chat_17485001": "Time's running out. Respond, right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_17485002": "G-Good evening, Eicy!",
  "str_quest_chat_17485003": "Is there an emergency?",
  "str_quest_chat_17485004": "I've prepared all kinds of materials today...",
  "str_quest_chat_17485005": "Materials for building a house, that I gleaned from a book on construction.",
  "str_quest_chat_17485006": "Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with the Colossus' construction...",
  "str_quest_chat_17485007": "Even though I have all the materials I need, I can't just build it, no matter how badly I want to...",
  "str_quest_chat_17485008": "I have a bad feeling about this...",
  "str_quest_chat_17485009": "You're missing your old torture chamber again, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_17485010": "Of course I am! Tell me, what do I have to do to get a teensy-weensy torture chamber in the Colossus?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17485011": "If anyone knows this big guy's structure the best, it's you!",
  "str_quest_chat_17485012": "...Give it up, Eicy. I won't tell you anything, now or ever!",
  "str_quest_chat_17486001": "It's nighttime...",
  "str_quest_chat_17486002": "Hmm, yes, so it is.",
  "str_quest_chat_17486003": "Since it's nighttime, let's go seek a little excitement.",
  "str_quest_chat_17486004": "Like... a tour around my interrogation room?",
  "str_quest_chat_17486005": "No, I'll pass!",
  "str_quest_chat_17486006": "I knew you would say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_17486007": "Then why bother asking?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17486008": "Well, you just keep up that cautiousness.",
  "str_quest_chat_17486009": "Be careful to stay away from the curse. Don't let it taint you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17487001": "Gooooooood evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_17487002": "G-Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_17487003": "I hardly said a word. Why are you so scared and stammering?",
  "str_quest_chat_17487004": "What an amusing reaction.",
  "str_quest_chat_17487005": "What're you planning now?",
  "str_quest_chat_17487006": "I was just greeting you in an entirely ordinary way!",
  "str_quest_chat_17487007": "Oh, do you have a needle and thread?",
  "str_quest_chat_17487008": "What for...",
  "str_quest_chat_17487009": "Oh, I could do so much!",
  "str_quest_chat_17487010": "I could stitch a wound. Or use them in an interrogation.",
  "str_quest_chat_17487011": "Or more importantly, fix my eye mask.",
  "str_quest_chat_17487012": "Okay, but that's the only thing you're allowed to do!",
  "str_quest_chat_17487013": "You're so mean.",
  "str_quest_chat_17488001": "I'm going to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_17488002": "Why so early today?",
  "str_quest_chat_17488003": "I haven't got anyone to interrogate.",
  "str_quest_chat_17488004": "Unless you'd like to help me stick to my usual habit of going to bed very late—",
  "str_quest_chat_17488005": "By volunteering to be interrogated?",
  "str_quest_chat_17488006": "Let's pretend I never spoke!",
  "str_quest_chat_17488007": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_17501001": "Because you're not like these other fools, I'm calling you Snowball and not Blockhead",
  "str_quest_chat_17501002": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_17501003": "That made me sound silly.",
  "str_quest_chat_17501004": "Oh, thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17501005": "Snowball just sounds weird.",
  "str_quest_chat_17501006": "But doesn't it sound cute?",
  "str_quest_chat_17501007": "It's not a cuteness issue...",
  "str_quest_chat_17501008": "Just skip it, Snowball. I need a quiet room.",
  "str_quest_chat_17501009": "The one I have right now is too loud.",
  "str_quest_chat_17501010": "Oh, okay, I'll make arrangements.",
  "str_quest_chat_17501011": "Thanks. It's late, I'm turning in.",
  "str_quest_chat_17501012": "See you tomorrow, my adorable Snowball.",
  "str_quest_chat_17501013": "See you tomorrow... Wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_17501014": "I just let her get away with calling me Snowball!",
  "str_quest_chat_17561001": "Oh, good afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_17561002": "Good afternoon, Sikare!",
  "str_quest_chat_17561003": "Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_17561004": "Never thought you'd ask me such a trite question, like the rest of those insects.",
  "str_quest_chat_17561005": "Uh... W-Well, I just think...",
  "str_quest_chat_17561006": "Eating a decent lunch at the right time is good for your health, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_17561007": "It might sound trite, but I think it's a pretty normal way of expressing concern for others. Don't you agree?",
  "str_quest_chat_17561008": "I see... I'll think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17562001": "Good afternoon, Snowball.",
  "str_quest_chat_17562002": "Afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_17562003": "Another ordinary afternoon passes us by.",
  "str_quest_chat_17562004": "Hmm... It may be ordinary, but isn't ordinary something to be happy about as well?",
  "str_quest_chat_17562005": "It is, but it's not something I'm used to.",
  "str_quest_chat_17562006": "Ahh, Sikare...",
  "str_quest_chat_17562007": "Yes, Snowball?",
  "str_quest_chat_17562008": "Rest assured, I'm not afflicted with the emotional problems paramecia have.",
  "str_quest_chat_17562009": "I'll like to be alone right now, so goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat_17562010": "Err, alright... bye then.",
  "str_quest_chat_17563001": "Good afternoon, Snowball.",
  "str_quest_chat_17563002": "Good afternoon, Sikare.",
  "str_quest_chat_17563003": "Not taking a nap?",
  "str_quest_chat_17563004": "You mean trapping your consciousness in the confines of your body?",
  "str_quest_chat_17563005": "Or do you mean squandering time through napping?",
  "str_quest_chat_17563006": "Uh... I just wanted a break...",
  "str_quest_chat_17563007": "Otherwise I might doze off later.",
  "str_quest_chat_17563008": "Well then, sleep tight.",
  "str_quest_chat_17563009": "Have a good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_17563010": "You too...",
  "str_quest_chat_17564001": "Good afternoon, Snowball.",
  "str_quest_chat_17564002": "Good afternoon, Sikare.",
  "str_quest_chat_17564003": "What's Snowball doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_17564004": "Oh... having lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_17564005": "Really? I'm actually feeling a little hungry myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_17564006": "Hmm... The Crypt is empty. I need to find some food...",
  "str_quest_chat_17565001": "The noon sun is too bright.",
  "str_quest_chat_17565002": "Sounds like the sun is shining brightly where you are, Sikare.",
  "str_quest_chat_17565003": "Yeah, but I still don't like this kind of weather.",
  "str_quest_chat_17565004": "Cold weather is more comfortable and calmer.",
  "str_quest_chat_17565005": "Right now, all I can feel is the heat.",
  "str_quest_chat_17565006": "I think I need to rest for a while and wake up when night falls...",
  "str_quest_chat_17566001": "It's noon. I should be sleeping in my tomb—",
  "str_quest_chat_17566002": "But someone woke me up.",
  "str_quest_chat_17566003": "Who?",
  "str_quest_chat_17566004": "A bunch of stupid grave robbers.",
  "str_quest_chat_17566005": "Now, I need to chase them off and think of adequate punishment for them...",
  "str_quest_chat_17566006": "Be quiet, you noisy blockhead.",
  "str_quest_chat_17567001": "The quiet afternoon makes me feel so relaxed.",
  "str_quest_chat_17567002": "Do you have any plans for the afternoon, Snowball?",
  "str_quest_chat_17567003": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_17567004": "I'm gonna take a lunch break.",
  "str_quest_chat_17567005": "Oh, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_17567006": "But night time is a lot more precious to me. My day really starts at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17567007": "As the guardian of the Crypt, I have to drive off people who shouldn't be here constantly.",
  "str_quest_chat_17567008": "Although, I also hope that one day I can break free from the shackles of the Crypt...",
  "str_quest_chat_17581001": "It's a beautiful night out, Snowball.",
  "str_quest_chat_17581002": "Yeah, it is very nice.",
  "str_quest_chat_17581003": "Oh, you know the implications of that?",
  "str_quest_chat_17581004": "What is \"That\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_17581005": "Nothing, but I want you to know I got it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17581006": "Huh???",
  "str_quest_chat_17581007": "Good night, sleep tight.",
  "str_quest_chat_17582001": "The night is here.",
  "str_quest_chat_17582002": "Good evening... Sikare...",
  "str_quest_chat_17582003": "The night sky from the Bridge sure is beautiful.",
  "str_quest_chat_17582004": "I agree... But it's getting late, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_17582005": "Gazing at the boundless sky beats staring at the ceiling in my room any day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17582006": "Well, you're right about that. The sky really is amazing...",
  "str_quest_chat_17582007": "But if you ask me, a comfortable bedroom is amazing in its way, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_17582008": "The comfort of familiarity...",
  "str_quest_chat_17582009": "Maybe someday I'll understand the meaning of your words.",
  "str_quest_chat_17582010": "For now, you're right. I should probably get some sleep. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17582011": "Oh... Good night, Sikare.",
  "str_quest_chat_17583001": "I heard you were once imprisoned inside this Colossus. Is that true?",
  "str_quest_chat_17583002": "Hmm... Yeah, it's true.",
  "str_quest_chat_17583003": "Didn't you find it incredibly dull?",
  "str_quest_chat_17583004": "Of course I did... But things have gotten much better now!",
  "str_quest_chat_17583005": "That's because I've made lots of friends since then...",
  "str_quest_chat_17583006": "I didn't know anything about friends back then...",
  "str_quest_chat_17583007": "Escaping your imprisonment... And even making friends? I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_17583008": "Yeah... So who knows?",
  "str_quest_chat_17583009": "Maybe a surprise will happen sometime in the future!",
  "str_quest_chat_17583010": "Maybe.",
  "str_quest_chat_17583011": "I just hope... Everything turns out the way you hope.",
  "str_quest_chat_17583012": "It's getting late, get some rest. Pleasant dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_17584001": "I wonder how nights look in your eyes, Snowball?",
  "str_quest_chat_17584002": "If you can see Light Trails, then I wonder, what is the world like through your eyes?",
  "str_quest_chat_17584003": "It should be the same as everyone else...",
  "str_quest_chat_17584004": "After all, Caelestites and Aurorians share the same world.",
  "str_quest_chat_17584005": "There's one difference though...",
  "str_quest_chat_17584006": "To me, the world is full of the new and unknown.",
  "str_quest_chat_17584007": "Looks like you and I feel the same way.",
  "str_quest_chat_17584008": "It's getting late.",
  "str_quest_chat_17584009": "Take some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_17584010": "Okay, good night, Sikare.",
  "str_quest_chat_17585001": "The stars at night are so pretty...",
  "str_quest_chat_17585002": "Yeah, so many shining stars in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_17585003": "They must be loose and free...",
  "str_quest_chat_17585004": "No, the stars have bounds.",
  "str_quest_chat_17585005": "Otherwise, they would not have fixed orbits.",
  "str_quest_chat_17585006": "What? Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_17585007": "But they also have a vast night sky to themselves.",
  "str_quest_chat_17585008": "Perhaps they are freer than Aurorians.",
  "str_quest_chat_17641001": "Hello, kid. I'm Constantine, a traveling Eclipsite hunter.",
  "str_quest_chat_17641002": "Nice to meet you. I didn't know that's a career...",
  "str_quest_chat_17641003": "Eclipsite hunters are common, just not nomads like me.",
  "str_quest_chat_17641004": "So you like to travel?",
  "str_quest_chat_17641005": "To me, it means the joy of exploring the unknown and experiencing different stories.",
  "str_quest_chat_17641006": "I've probably killed many Eclipsites that you've never even heard of in my travels.",
  "str_quest_chat_17641007": "You must have a lot of interesting stories to tell.",
  "str_quest_chat_17641008": "Yes. I've probably killed many Eclipsites that you've never even heard of in my travels.",
  "str_quest_chat_17641009": "It's all in my journal. I'll tell you another day if you're interested.",
  "str_quest_chat_17641010": "I am interested in the tales, but not too sure about the killing Eclipsites part...",
  "str_quest_chat_17641011": "Don't worry, kid, I'll try to paint it not so bloody violent.",
  "str_quest_chat_17641012": "Not so bloody violent?",
  "str_quest_chat_17651001": "Good morning, child.",
  "str_quest_chat_17651002": "Hiccup. Hiccup. Hiccup.",
  "str_quest_chat_17651003": "...What was that, Mr. Constantine?",
  "str_quest_chat_17651004": "Is everything alright?",
  "str_quest_chat_17651005": "My apologies, child.",
  "str_quest_chat_17651006": "After spending so many years hunting in the wilderness by myself, using this terminal... requires more focus than I thought.",
  "str_quest_chat_17651007": "I am trying to use it to record my feelings and experiences.",
  "str_quest_chat_17651008": "So just now, did you... have the hiccups?",
  "str_quest_chat_17651009": "Indeed. Breakfast was a bit too plentiful for me, but I didn't want anything to go to waste... So I ate them all.",
  "str_quest_chat_17651010": "I-I could always set you up with smaller portions, if you'd like?",
  "str_quest_chat_17651011": "Overeating all the time can't be good for you, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_17651012": "Your help would be much appreciated, child.",
  "str_quest_chat_17652001": "The morning breeze has brought news.",
  "str_quest_chat_17652002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_17652003": "News of all sorts, child.",
  "str_quest_chat_17652004": "Temperature, weather, and information about prey.",
  "str_quest_chat_17652005": "Are you going hunting again today?",
  "str_quest_chat_17652006": "Yes, child.",
  "str_quest_chat_17652007": "May you be successful!",
  "str_quest_chat_17653001": "Good morning, child.",
  "str_quest_chat_17653002": "Good morning, Constantine.",
  "str_quest_chat_17653003": "Getting up in the morning and bathing in the fresh sunshine is the perfect start to a dynamic day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17653004": "The way you feel in the morning determines how you feel for the rest of the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17653005": "Okay, I'm gonna go enjoy the sunshine!",
  "str_quest_chat_17654001": "Morning is the most important time for a hunter.",
  "str_quest_chat_17654002": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_17654003": "If you want to return with a full load after dusk, it all depends on the hunting spot you choose in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_17654004": "A crappy choice of place in the morning will spook the animals and they won't come out in the afternoon as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_17654005": "In the jungle, animals live by the law of caution.",
  "str_quest_chat_17654006": "I see... This is something only you'd know about, Constantine...",
  "str_quest_chat_17655001": "I'm used to taking my notebook with me every morning to record my day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17655002": "Some people might think this is a strange habit, but I can't control this impulse to record everything.",
  "str_quest_chat_17655003": "But you recorded a lot of strange things too, Constantine.",
  "str_quest_chat_17655004": "Different strokes for different folks... As long as it doesn't hurt anyone, eh?",
  "str_quest_chat_17655005": "Recording my days helps me to hold on to how I felt at that time, and I can recall that memory more easily when thinking back to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17655006": "Of course, some things seem quite useless now, but they may come in handy one day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17656001": "When I woke up this morning, I felt particularly cold... It reminded me of my time in Northland.",
  "str_quest_chat_17656002": "You haven't been sleeping on the street, have you, Constantine?",
  "str_quest_chat_17656003": "Wandering around has become a favorite habit of mine, and I'm still not bored of it yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_17656004": "I was walking under the bridge yesterday, so I just decided to sleep there... Maybe it wasn't warm enough.",
  "str_quest_chat_17656005": "Do you plan on continuing this life of wandering, Constantine?",
  "str_quest_chat_17656006": "When do you plan on settling down?",
  "str_quest_chat_17656007": "One day, I will settle down.",
  "str_quest_chat_17656008": "It's just that this matter means a lot to me, so I'm still thinking about it...",
  "str_quest_chat_17661001": "Good afternoon, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_17661002": "Good afternoon, Mr. Constantine.",
  "str_quest_chat_17661003": "I didn't see you this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_17661004": "I left to kill some Eclipsites before dawn and just came back.",
  "str_quest_chat_17661005": "A solo face-off again?",
  "str_quest_chat_17661006": "Yes, that's my style.",
  "str_quest_chat_17661007": "You really are diligent...",
  "str_quest_chat_17661008": "It's just doing the same thing over and over. That's far from \"hardworking.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_17661009": "One day, when the world is free from Eclipsites...",
  "str_quest_chat_17661010": "Maybe I'll find a place and settle down.",
  "str_quest_chat_17681001": "The wind whistles in the night...",
  "str_quest_chat_17681002": "The wind brings with it the amorous feelings of far away places, luring people to uncover their stories.",
  "str_quest_chat_17681003": "There's also the scent of Eclipsites, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_17681004": "I'll stop at nothing to capture them.",
  "str_quest_chat_17681005": "And the scent of freedom.",
  "str_quest_chat_17681006": "I detect a longing in your voice.",
  "str_quest_chat_17681007": "I'm a little envious of your carefree life...",
  "str_quest_chat_17681008": "You're young. You have much to experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_17681009": "Don't envy me. You'll find what you're looking for one day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17681010": "Yeah... You're absolutely right.",
  "str_quest_chat_17681011": "Rest well. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17681012": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17701001": "Got time to spare, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_17701002": "Come drink and feast with us!",
  "str_quest_chat_17701003": "I can't hold my liquor...",
  "str_quest_chat_17701004": "But I'm all over the feast part!",
  "str_quest_chat_17701005": "Why the sudden invitation, though?",
  "str_quest_chat_17701006": "Heh, because you're a cool kid!",
  "str_quest_chat_17701007": "I don't mind having you as a friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_17701008": "I might look easy-going, but I'm picky when it comes to making friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_17701009": "It's not easy meeting my lofty standards!",
  "str_quest_chat_17701010": "So stop hesitating and join us, you've got talent kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_17701011": "It's a hoot hanging out with the Rediesel Wrench!",
  "str_quest_chat_17701012": "Wait, are you inviting me to join the Rediesel Wrench?",
  "str_quest_chat_17701013": "Yeah. Why, you don't want to?",
  "str_quest_chat_17701014": "Well, it is a surprise to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_17741001": "Hey, just dropping in to say hi.",
  "str_quest_chat_17741002": "This is a nice place you got, kid!",
  "str_quest_chat_17741003": "Hello, welcome to Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_17741004": "Soroz? That does sound like an impressive flying machine.",
  "str_quest_chat_17741005": "Is there any other kind?",
  "str_quest_chat_17741006": "Of course, the Lepidoz we got, for one.",
  "str_quest_chat_17741007": "The kind that runs on the ground!",
  "str_quest_chat_17741008": "Oh, I-I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_17741009": "I'm interested in other Colossi. We must talk later!",
  "str_quest_chat_17741010": "Runs on the ground?",
  "str_quest_chat_17741011": "I'd like to see it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17741012": "No problem, just show me how you get yours to fly!",
  "str_quest_chat_17741013": "Fly? You want to get your Colossus up in the air?",
  "str_quest_chat_17741014": "Yeah! It's cool to fly!",
  "str_quest_chat_17741015": "It's a deal, then. I'll be back for you to teach me all the secrets, and I mean all!",
  "str_quest_chat_17741016": "But I don't think that's teachable!",
  "str_quest_chat_17751001": "Get up, kid!",
  "str_quest_chat_17751002": "I-I'm up!",
  "str_quest_chat_17751003": "We are going out to do some scavenging today. Wanna tag along?",
  "str_quest_chat_17751004": "I'm sure we'll find even better loot with you around!",
  "str_quest_chat_17751005": "...Scavenging?",
  "str_quest_chat_17751006": "Yeah, scavenging! You know, looking for stuff we can use, so we can replenish our stocks and fix up our gear? It's the only way to get by in the desert!",
  "str_quest_chat_17751007": "If you come with us, I can guarantee you the comfiest seat in the convoy, and maybe even a pack of lizard jerky!",
  "str_quest_chat_17751008": "I... I think I'll pass, thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_17751009": "Turning me down, eh? I'll drag you out of your cave one of these days, kid! Mark my words!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752001": "Kid!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752002": "I'm not here!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752003": "Hurry up! Wash your face and brush your teeth, it's time for breakfast!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752004": "I'm no—Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_17752005": "Weren't you out scavenging?",
  "str_quest_chat_17752006": "Well, if you'd like, I can arrange another round just for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752007": "Azure is here too. I don't mind asking Bopper to put another seat on the top of her car and make that your VIP seat.",
  "str_quest_chat_17752008": "I'll pass!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752009": "You guys definitely aren't planning for me to just ride along.",
  "str_quest_chat_17752010": "I bet you wanna tie me to the top of the car!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752011": "Haha, we've all gotta step out of comfort zones while we're alive!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752012": "Otherwise life would be so boring!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752013": "Anyway, get out of bed now!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752014": "Or my wrench will find itself lodged into some poor fella's door.",
  "str_quest_chat_17752015": "And obviously that poor fella would be me?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752016": "Fantastic deductive reasoning!",
  "str_quest_chat_17752017": "Have mercy, I'll be up in a minute!",
  "str_quest_chat_17753001": "Too bad you didn't get to see what just happened.",
  "str_quest_chat_17753002": "Huh? What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_17753003": "Brock and Odi nearly got into a fight on the Bridge just now, and the ruckus they made!",
  "str_quest_chat_17753004": "Isn't it a little early for a fight?",
  "str_quest_chat_17753005": "Then, did you stop them?",
  "str_quest_chat_17753006": "Me? Why would I? I even went and got Eve to come watch.",
  "str_quest_chat_17753007": "Let them handle their own affairs. It's no big deal.",
  "str_quest_chat_17753008": "Ahem... So, they didn't end up fighting on the Colossus, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_17753009": "Well, no.",
  "str_quest_chat_17753010": "Phew, that's good.",
  "str_quest_chat_17754001": "Hey, deliver breakfast to Eve for me, will ya, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_17754002": "Sure, but what happened to you?",
  "str_quest_chat_17754003": "I can't move... Up all night last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17754004": "Out plundering again?",
  "str_quest_chat_17754005": "Yeah, but took nothing back.",
  "str_quest_chat_17754006": "What? The great, awesome Sinsa slipped up?",
  "str_quest_chat_17754007": "I didn't slip up. I had the loot...",
  "str_quest_chat_17754008": "But the guy said it's coming out of his pocket and he may even lose his job.",
  "str_quest_chat_17754009": "If he couldn't get paid, he couldn't afford the medical bills for his little sister.",
  "str_quest_chat_17754010": "So, you decided not to rob him because that reminded you of Eve?",
  "str_quest_chat_17754011": "I even escorted him to his destination so no one would try to rob him.",
  "str_quest_chat_17754012": "I didn't get back until dawn.",
  "str_quest_chat_17754013": "That's enough, I'm sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_17754014": "All right, go back to crashing.",
  "str_quest_chat_17755001": "Where can you get a sharp kitchen knife, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_17755002": "Why? Are you switching to using kitchen knives as a weapon?",
  "str_quest_chat_17755003": "No, I'm cooking.",
  "str_quest_chat_17755004": "Shouldn't there be kitchen knives in the kitchen?",
  "str_quest_chat_17755005": "I tried them all. None of them could make julienne tofu.",
  "str_quest_chat_17755006": "Julienne tofu?",
  "str_quest_chat_17755007": "Eve heard about a dish made with thin, sliced tofu strips.",
  "str_quest_chat_17755008": "She wanted very much to see it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17755009": "So I wanted to make it as a surprise.",
  "str_quest_chat_17755010": "That sounds pretty hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_17755011": "Instead of finding a knife for the job, it's probably easier to ask a chef.",
  "str_quest_chat_17755012": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_17755013": "Fine, I'll go track down a chef.",
  "str_quest_chat_17756001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_17756002": "I just picked a basket of Rediesel dates and left it at your door.",
  "str_quest_chat_17756003": "Oh, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_17756004": "Have you had Rediesel dates before?",
  "str_quest_chat_17756005": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_17756006": "Try mine, they're better than what you can buy anywhere.",
  "str_quest_chat_17756007": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat_17756008": "It's a Rediesel Wrench specialty, very sweet.",
  "str_quest_chat_17756009": "I planted the trees 15 years ago myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_17756010": "They finally bear fruit.",
  "str_quest_chat_17756011": "What, it took 15 years?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17756012": "Yeah. It's hard to come by, so enjoy every bite.",
  "str_quest_chat_17756013": "I will. Thanks so much!",
  "str_quest_chat_17757001": "What's this? Does the Colossus not serve alcohol for breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_17757002": "Why are you drinking so early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_17757003": "To celebrate, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_17757004": "Celebrate what?",
  "str_quest_chat_17757005": "I improved the trap a few days ago, and when I checked today...",
  "str_quest_chat_17757006": "Guess what it caught?",
  "str_quest_chat_17757007": "A big animal.",
  "str_quest_chat_17757008": "Aurorian.",
  "str_quest_chat_17757009": "Heh, caught an Eclipsite.",
  "str_quest_chat_17757010": "Wow, that means we can use it as an improvised fortification.",
  "str_quest_chat_17757011": "Yeah. Ain't that neat?",
  "str_quest_chat_17757012": "Worth a round of celebration!",
  "str_quest_chat_17757013": "All right! We'll have an upside-down drinking contest!",
  "str_quest_chat_17757014": "I already got you on the list, just show up tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_17757015": "Th-That won't be necessary!",
  "str_quest_chat_17758001": "Coming for a dip in the hot spring with me, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_17758002": "Now? I'm not even out of bed yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_17758003": "Fine, I'll go alone.",
  "str_quest_chat_17758004": "I'd like to go too... Can it be later, though?",
  "str_quest_chat_17758005": "I can't wait. My back is terribly sore.",
  "str_quest_chat_17758006": "How did that happen this early in the day?",
  "str_quest_chat_17758007": "Made a round in the desert this morning and saw a little girl praying to her deceased mother.",
  "str_quest_chat_17758008": "She was crying the whole time, that poor thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_17758009": "You know how I'm a softie when it comes to women and children.",
  "str_quest_chat_17758010": "To make her happy, I had to resort to acrobatic flips and storytelling.",
  "str_quest_chat_17758011": "It took me 582 somersaults to finish one story... That wore me out!",
  "str_quest_chat_17758012": "You did both at the same time?",
  "str_quest_chat_17758013": "Never mind, I gotta go.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759001": "I distributed the books you sent last time to everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759002": "Glad they served a purpose.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759003": "You take the test tomorrow too.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759004": "What test?",
  "str_quest_chat_17759005": "On the books you sent, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759006": "Everybody got their own copy and I'm doing a random exam.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759007": "I want to know if they've been reading it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759008": "You've read them yourself since you sent them, I presume.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759009": "So you can be a part of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759010": "Well, uh... actually...",
  "str_quest_chat_17759011": "Don't tell me you've never read them?",
  "str_quest_chat_17759012": "No, I loved to learn...",
  "str_quest_chat_17759013": "I knew that wouldn't be a problem for the Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat_17759014": "Got a free day today. Why don't we go race some cars?",
  "str_quest_chat_17759015": "No, I have to stay home and study for the test tomorrow...",
  "str_quest_chat_17759016": "Save that problem for tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759017": "It's too soon to worry about it today.",
  "str_quest_chat_17759018": "Easy for you to say...",
  "str_quest_chat_17761001": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_17761002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_17761003": "Perfect. Want to try the Rediesel wormsteak?",
  "str_quest_chat_17761004": "Wormsteak?",
  "str_quest_chat_17761005": "That's right. Sandworm of the finest quality, coupled with the hottest chili, deep-fried in a pan!",
  "str_quest_chat_17761006": "Why do I think that could be appetizing?",
  "str_quest_chat_17762001": "Time to work up a sweat!",
  "str_quest_chat_17762002": "Afternoon, Sinsa...",
  "str_quest_chat_17762003": "Are you... getting ready to take a nap?",
  "str_quest_chat_17762004": "Yeah... What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_17762005": "Working out, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_17762006": "I gotta train non-stop to keep stockpiling my power, and bust all out at once in the battle!",
  "str_quest_chat_17762007": "What do you say? Wanna get some training in with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_17762008": "...How do you usually train?",
  "str_quest_chat_17762009": "First, I start by throwing my wrench into the air... then I catch it! I will do that twenty times!",
  "str_quest_chat_17762010": "S-Sounds way too intense... I'm out!",
  "str_quest_chat_17762011": "You don't train enough! Working out is the key to a strong and healthy body!",
  "str_quest_chat_17763001": "Are you done eating yet? I need a hand here.",
  "str_quest_chat_17763002": "Sure, I'm almost done! What do you need me to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_17763003": "One of my boys has been feeling down lately. I'm pretty sure it's because I stomp him into the ground every time he challenges me.",
  "str_quest_chat_17763004": "He challenged me again today. But this time I think I'm gonna make it easier for him. Level the playing field, y'know?",
  "str_quest_chat_17763005": "When it's time, I'll invite you to the match. I just need you to cheer him on nice and loud while we go at it. Understand?",
  "str_quest_chat_17763006": "A Caelestite's support ought to make a pretty big difference, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_17763007": "Of course! You can count on me!",
  "str_quest_chat_17763008": "Cool! I'll be seeing you, then!",
  "str_quest_chat_17763009": "Good luck! Er... I guess I shouldn't be telling you that.",
  "str_quest_chat_17764001": "Are you taking a nap? I got something to talk to you about.",
  "str_quest_chat_17764002": "I just woke up... What's up, Sinsa?",
  "str_quest_chat_17764003": "I just wanted to apologize!",
  "str_quest_chat_17764004": "Why are you apologizing, all of a sudden?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17764005": "The boys have been feeling a little cooped up lately... So they held a drag race in the hallway!",
  "str_quest_chat_17764006": "Wait... A drag race? Inside the Colossus?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17764007": "Yeah, but not with real cars... The boys made some mini cars, only about the size of your head.",
  "str_quest_chat_17764008": "They weren't anything special, just small, simple, remote-controlled cars. Crashing was allowed though, so they got wrecked after a few races!",
  "str_quest_chat_17764009": "Although, they might've done a little damage to the Colossus... I think I saw something smoking earlier?",
  "str_quest_chat_17764010": "S-Smoke?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17764011": "In any case, I told the boys to fix and clean everything up, nice and neat. Guess the damage wasn't as bad as I thought!",
  "str_quest_chat_17764012": "I still felt like I should apologize, though, so here I am. If any problems crop up later, let me know!",
  "str_quest_chat_17764013": "If it's really bad, I can always go find something to make it up to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17764014": "O-Okay... I guess that's the best I could ask for...",
  "str_quest_chat_17765001": "It's noon, kid! Why don't you come hang out for a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_17765002": "Hey, Sinsa. I could really use a nap, so I think I'll pass...",
  "str_quest_chat_17765003": "A nap?! You'll have all the time in the world to sleep once you're dead!",
  "str_quest_chat_17765004": "You should be spending every second of every minute of your life living as fast and free as possible!",
  "str_quest_chat_17765005": "...Did you just get into a fight or something?",
  "str_quest_chat_17765006": "What's with all the bravado...",
  "str_quest_chat_17765007": "No, I'm having a nice, meaty lunch! It was prepared with the simplest, most effective methods and the most top-quality ingredients!",
  "str_quest_chat_17765008": "I can't help but feel like I'm exploding with tons of energy! Wanna try some?",
  "str_quest_chat_17765009": "Uh... I already had lunch today, but thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_17766001": "I want spicy barbecue pork chops for lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat_17766002": "The kind that leaves your mouth tingling real nice.",
  "str_quest_chat_17766003": "The best way to beat the afternoon heat is by sweating buckets!",
  "str_quest_chat_17766004": "Wouldn't eating that make you feel even hotter?",
  "str_quest_chat_17766005": "That's exactly the point!",
  "str_quest_chat_17766006": "Kid, I see you're too young to understand the joys of sweating.",
  "str_quest_chat_17766007": "Forget it, enough talk. I'm gonna eat some more!",
  "str_quest_chat_17766008": "Right, I can see you have really interesting hobbies.",
  "str_quest_chat_17767001": "Want some shaved ice?",
  "str_quest_chat_17767002": "Yes!",
  "str_quest_chat_17767003": "Everyone should have shaved ice for lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_17767004": "Well, I just caught hold of a Firefly, so I'll get this fella to drop it off for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17767005": "Thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_17767006": "I don't feel like eating that.",
  "str_quest_chat_17767007": "I just had my meal, and I'll feel bloated if I eat shaved ice right after.",
  "str_quest_chat_17767008": "Sounds like a weak stomach to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_17767009": "I'm doing this for my health!",
  "str_quest_chat_17767010": "Suit yourself. I'm moving on to bowl number six.",
  "str_quest_chat_17767011": "What an appetite you have...",
  "str_quest_chat_17801001": "It's so pretty outside the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_17801002": "Blue sky, white clouds, cute little birdies...",
  "str_quest_chat_17801003": "And flying couriers!",
  "str_quest_chat_17801004": "Do you enjoy the view when you pilot the Colossus, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_17801005": "Yes",
  "str_quest_chat_17801006": "Got to watch out especially for those couriers and not hit them.",
  "str_quest_chat_17801007": "It's all right...",
  "str_quest_chat_17801008": "Not so much as enjoying the view, but rather paying attention so you don't accidentally hit something.",
  "str_quest_chat_17801009": "True. The couriers are too adorable and PlayerName is too nice to crash into them.",
  "str_quest_chat_17801010": "I wouldn't try to crash into them even if they weren't adorable.",
  "str_quest_chat_17801011": "Oh, PlayerName is very compassionate too!",
  "str_quest_chat_17801012": "So, PlayerName, can you teach me to pilot the Colossus sometime?",
  "str_quest_chat_17801013": "I promise to stay out of the adorable couriers' way!",
  "str_quest_chat_17801014": "And the not-so-adorable ones too!",
  "str_quest_chat_17801015": "Looks like Eve is also very compassionate.",
  "str_quest_chat_17841001": "Hello, I'm here.",
  "str_quest_chat_17841002": "Sorry for the trouble I cause!",
  "str_quest_chat_17841003": "Hello, welcome to Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_17841004": "No sweat, everyone here is cool about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17841005": "Really? That's great!",
  "str_quest_chat_17841006": "Hope you enjoy your life here.",
  "str_quest_chat_17841007": "I will! The Colossus is my favorite! You can see a lot of wonderful sceneries from it!",
  "str_quest_chat_17841008": "Oh yeah, let's fly over the Rediesel Desert next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_17841009": "The view from above must be spectacular!",
  "str_quest_chat_17841010": "Oh, sorry, did I say something wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_17841011": "Not at all! We'll do that, Eve, when we get a chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_17851001": "Morning! Are you awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_17851002": "Half-awake, I guess...",
  "str_quest_chat_17851003": "Oh, I'm so sorry to bother you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17851004": "I'll come back another time.",
  "str_quest_chat_17851005": "I'm going now. Sweet dreams!",
  "str_quest_chat_17851006": "But you already woke me up...",
  "str_quest_chat_17852001": "M... Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_17852002": "Good morning, Eve!",
  "str_quest_chat_17852003": "*Yawn* So sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_17852004": "Hmm? Did you stay up late last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_17852005": "Y-Yeah... Ugh, I'm so tired!",
  "str_quest_chat_17852006": "Why did you stay up so late, Eve?",
  "str_quest_chat_17852007": "I was... trying to make a special hair-tie... A black and white one, with a repeating pattern...",
  "str_quest_chat_17852008": "But I could never get it right... Ugh, I should take a better look next time...",
  "str_quest_chat_17852009": "...Uh-oh! I just gave it away!",
  "str_quest_chat_17852010": "I... I should really get going! Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_17853001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_17853002": "Morning, Eve!",
  "str_quest_chat_17853003": "Hey, Navigator? I just wanted to know...",
  "str_quest_chat_17853004": "What did you think of breakfast today?",
  "str_quest_chat_17853005": "Uh... It kind of tasted like Vice made it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17853006": "The fried eggs had a... familiar taste.",
  "str_quest_chat_17853007": "Huh? Does that mean that Vice is really good at cooking?",
  "str_quest_chat_17853008": "The opposite, unfortunately... The eggs were more salt than ever...",
  "str_quest_chat_17853009": "*Gasp* O-Oh... I see... *Sniff*",
  "str_quest_chat_17853010": "Even though it tasted bad, Sinsa still ate all of his breakfast... He even insisted that it tasted amazing...",
  "str_quest_chat_17853011": "D-Did you make breakfast this morning, Eve?",
  "str_quest_chat_17853012": "I'm so sorry! I... I ate all of my breakfast, too! I swear!",
  "str_quest_chat_17854001": "Good morning! Are you up?",
  "str_quest_chat_17854002": "Good morning, Eve. Yeah, I'm getting ready to leave now.",
  "str_quest_chat_17854003": "I see... Can you tell me what you're going to do today?",
  "str_quest_chat_17854004": "Hmm... Just patrolling the Colossus, I think?",
  "str_quest_chat_17854005": "What else do you usually do, besides patrolling the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_17854006": "Well, if there isn't anything pressing to attend to...",
  "str_quest_chat_17854007": "Aside from patrolling, I might do some training or read a book.",
  "str_quest_chat_17854008": "Oh, I see!",
  "str_quest_chat_17854009": "Thanks for telling me all of this! I still don't understand much about the outside world, you see...",
  "str_quest_chat_17854010": "I understand, Eve. Don't worry about it, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_17854011": "If you ever feel bored, you can always reach me on the terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat_17854012": "I know... Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_17855001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_17855002": "Morning, Eve.",
  "str_quest_chat_17855003": "I saw three little birds fly past my window today!",
  "str_quest_chat_17855004": "I also saw someone drinking their coffee on the Bridge...",
  "str_quest_chat_17855005": "I... I even overheard some people talking about my big brother...",
  "str_quest_chat_17855006": "Um...",
  "str_quest_chat_17855007": "What's the matter? Sorry if the Colossus is a bit noisy right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_17855008": "It's mostly because we don't really have any rules around here.",
  "str_quest_chat_17855009": "N-No, that's not what I meant at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_17855010": "I just wanted to say...",
  "str_quest_chat_17855011": "That I really enjoy living here! Thank you so much, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_17855012": "Ahaha... Well, I'm glad you like it!",
  "str_quest_chat_17856001": "Morning, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_17856002": "I found a cute-shaped cloud today!",
  "str_quest_chat_17856003": "A cute-shaped cloud? Somehow that makes me think of muffins.",
  "str_quest_chat_17856004": "Ohh? There were muffins at breakfast today!",
  "str_quest_chat_17856005": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_17856006": "Yes! What a coincidence!",
  "str_quest_chat_17856007": "Haha, I guess they are connected after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_17856008": "Yeah!",
  "str_quest_chat_17856009": "PlayerName, you should go get breakfast then!",
  "str_quest_chat_17856010": "I got it, Eve.",
  "str_quest_chat_17857001": "Lalala... I decorated the Colossus today with some potted plants!",
  "str_quest_chat_17857002": "I hope you like it!",
  "str_quest_chat_17857003": "You're up real early, Eve.",
  "str_quest_chat_17857004": "If I'd waited till later to place the plants, the Colossus would've been crowded...",
  "str_quest_chat_17857005": "If that happened, I'd be too shy.",
  "str_quest_chat_17857006": "Understood. I'll go check out your potted plants when I'm done.",
  "str_quest_chat_17857007": "Yay! Heehee!",
  "str_quest_chat_17861001": "Hmm... What should I eat for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_17861002": "Well, what do you usually like to eat, Eve?",
  "str_quest_chat_17861003": "Hmm... I like everything!",
  "str_quest_chat_17861004": "There are all kinds of food in the kitchen. Why don't I...",
  "str_quest_chat_17861005": "Ah! N-No, thanks! I don't want to bother you!",
  "str_quest_chat_17861006": "I'm sorry, I was just thinking out loud... I'm not bothering you, am I?",
  "str_quest_chat_17861007": "Not at all! What I was trying to say...",
  "str_quest_chat_17861008": "It was that I can ask the Fireflies to take you to the kitchen and let you see for yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_17861009": "I didn't mean to push you...",
  "str_quest_chat_17861010": "If it's hard for you to choose... maybe you can try the box lunch, then? They taste pretty good, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_17861011": "O-Okay...! Thank you! I'll go do that right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_17862001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_17862002": "What's up, Eve?",
  "str_quest_chat_17862003": "You seem really happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_17862004": "I helped make lunch again today, and when my brother tasted it, he said it was delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat_17862005": "And, for once, he didn't look like he was on the verge of tears!",
  "str_quest_chat_17862006": "So it was you that made today's lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat_17862007": "Yes! What do you think, PlayerName...? Any improvement in my cooking skills?",
  "str_quest_chat_17862008": "A lot!",
  "str_quest_chat_17862009": "The food was much more delicious compared to last time!",
  "str_quest_chat_17862010": "Well... Because I practiced hard for a long time and asked lots of people to help me.",
  "str_quest_chat_17862011": "Keep up the hard work.",
  "str_quest_chat_17862012": "But you really improved a lot!",
  "str_quest_chat_17862013": "Yes... I'll keep it up!",
  "str_quest_chat_17862014": "One day, I will cook delicious food.",
  "str_quest_chat_17862015": "Food that puts smiles on the faces of my brother, Dawn, and you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17863001": "Afternoon, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_17863002": "I'm going to let you in on a secret, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_17863003": "Huh? What's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_17863004": "Guess!",
  "str_quest_chat_17863005": "Hold on, let me guess...",
  "str_quest_chat_17863006": "Go on, go on!",
  "str_quest_chat_17863007": "... Well, I'm stumped.",
  "str_quest_chat_17863008": "Pfft!",
  "str_quest_chat_17863009": "In that case, I'll just tell you!",
  "str_quest_chat_17863010": "Actually, I'm able to—sleepwalk!",
  "str_quest_chat_17863011": "Whoa, really?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17863012": "Heeheehee, bet you had no idea, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_17864001": "Are you free this afternoon, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_17864002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_17864003": "I want to play petalball with you. It's kind of like badminton.",
  "str_quest_chat_17864004": "Petalball?",
  "str_quest_chat_17864005": "Yeah, I made it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_17864006": "Wouldn't a ball made of flower petals shatter upon impact?",
  "str_quest_chat_17864007": "But I don't want to pluck feathers from a bird...",
  "str_quest_chat_17864008": "Uh, you could just pick loose ones off the ground.",
  "str_quest_chat_17864009": "You could do that?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17864010": "But should we pick up feathers or play petalball today?",
  "str_quest_chat_17864011": "Pick up feathers.",
  "str_quest_chat_17864012": "Play petalball.",
  "str_quest_chat_17864013": "Okay, great, let's go!",
  "str_quest_chat_17865001": "Thank you, it was delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_17865002": "Say what?",
  "str_quest_chat_17865003": "The sweet pears you sent yesterday were very tasty!",
  "str_quest_chat_17865004": "Yeah, those were Umbraton specialty. Glad you liked it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17865005": "Yes, I love it. Sweet, juicy, like spring...",
  "str_quest_chat_17865006": "Oh, I can make pies out of them for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_17865007": "Pies?",
  "str_quest_chat_17865008": "Yes, pies that taste like spring!",
  "str_quest_chat_17865009": "I'll add in some spring flowers too. What flowers do you like?",
  "str_quest_chat_17865010": "Cherry blossom.",
  "str_quest_chat_17865011": "Sure, pear and cherry blossom filling with butter and honey.",
  "str_quest_chat_17865012": "Camellia.",
  "str_quest_chat_17865013": "Sure, pear and camellia filling with butter and honey.",
  "str_quest_chat_17865014": "I'm sure that will be delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_17865015": "I'm salivating already.",
  "str_quest_chat_17865016": "I'll drop it off as soon as it's done.",
  "str_quest_chat_17865017": "Thanks! Looking forward to it!",
  "str_quest_chat_17866001": "Huff... Finally, home!",
  "str_quest_chat_17866002": "Where did you go?",
  "str_quest_chat_17866003": "My brother took me to the market this morning to get new clothes!",
  "str_quest_chat_17866004": "I bought something for you as well! Guess what it is?",
  "str_quest_chat_17866005": "A silk scarf!",
  "str_quest_chat_17866006": "Uh, you didn't give me a chance to guess...",
  "str_quest_chat_17866007": "Still, I appreciate it. But isn't it for girls?",
  "str_quest_chat_17866008": "Not exactly, boys can wear it too.",
  "str_quest_chat_17866009": "It's windy in Rediesel Wrench. A scarf can shield your face and hair.",
  "str_quest_chat_17866010": "It can also help to keep you warm when it's cold at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17866011": "And you can use it as a small picnic blanket!",
  "str_quest_chat_17866012": "Wow, that does sound versatile.",
  "str_quest_chat_17866013": "Yes. That's why I bought it for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_17866014": "Speaking of that, we haven't had a picnic in a long time. We should do that when you're free.",
  "str_quest_chat_17866015": "Sure, I'm free right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_17867001": "I heard you haven't been sleeping well lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867002": "It's so-so. Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_17867003": "I got some things to set up in your room.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867004": "So you can sleep well at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867005": "What? What things?",
  "str_quest_chat_17867006": "A star lamp.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867007": "A veil.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867008": "And a glass of hot milk.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867009": "The lamp and the milk I can understand, but what's the veil for?",
  "str_quest_chat_17867010": "For hanging on the window in place of curtain.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867011": "It will filter moonlight into thin, lovely threads.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867012": "That should surely make you dream pleasant dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867013": "That sounds great, thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_17867014": "Okay, I'll go set it up for you right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_17867015": "Nah, skip it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867016": "I appreciate the thought, but I don't feel comfortable with the setup.",
  "str_quest_chat_17867017": "I see... I'll think of something else, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_17868001": "Let me ask you a question...",
  "str_quest_chat_17868002": "What kind of gifts do guys like?",
  "str_quest_chat_17868003": "You want to give a guy a gift?",
  "str_quest_chat_17868004": "Yeah, I'd like to make something for my brother.",
  "str_quest_chat_17868005": "Clothes? Shoes? Gloves?",
  "str_quest_chat_17868006": "Sinsa would love anything as long as you made it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17868007": "But he wouldn't let me because he didn't want me getting poked by needles.",
  "str_quest_chat_17868008": "What a protective sibling...",
  "str_quest_chat_17868009": "How about if I clean his room?",
  "str_quest_chat_17868010": "Did he go for that?",
  "str_quest_chat_17868011": "No... He said the dust will make me cough.",
  "str_quest_chat_17868012": "I know what would be the best gift for him.",
  "str_quest_chat_17868013": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_17868014": "Your safety and well-being.",
  "str_quest_chat_17869001": "Reporting!",
  "str_quest_chat_17869002": "These are the loose items I found when cleaning the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_17869003": "An earring, a weapon, and a battle plan.",
  "str_quest_chat_17869004": "Earring I can understand, but losing a weapon and battle plan...?",
  "str_quest_chat_17869005": "What kind of people do we have living in the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_17869006": "I see we have to post a lost-and-found notice.",
  "str_quest_chat_17869007": "Oh, I found other things before.",
  "str_quest_chat_17869008": "How many?",
  "str_quest_chat_17869009": "There were miscellaneous ones every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17869010": "I'd just leave them in the Lounge for their owners to pick up.",
  "str_quest_chat_17869011": "I see we have to make some house rules.",
  "str_quest_chat_17869012": "They can't just lose stuff left and right like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_17869013": "Don't worry!",
  "str_quest_chat_17869014": "If someone lost you, I'll keep you in a safe place!",
  "str_quest_chat_17941001": "Excuse me, but is there anywhere on the Colossus that's full of blooming flowers?",
  "str_quest_chat_17941002": "No, I don't think so.",
  "str_quest_chat_17941003": "You need a greenhouse?",
  "str_quest_chat_17941004": "Blooming flowers?",
  "str_quest_chat_17941005": "You mean a greenhouse?",
  "str_quest_chat_17941006": "No, that's not the kind of flowers I want.",
  "str_quest_chat_17941007": "The kind I want has been through the darkness...",
  "str_quest_chat_17941008": "Growing and blossoming in adversity.",
  "str_quest_chat_17941009": "Adversity? How can flowers blossom in that?",
  "str_quest_chat_17941010": "It looks like you have a lot to learn.",
  "str_quest_chat_17941011": "That's okay. I'll plant one for you to see.",
  "str_quest_chat_17941012": "In that case, can you point me to the darkest, crappiest, most adverse spot on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_17941013": "So I can go there and make the flower bloom.",
  "str_quest_chat_17941014": "As far as I know, there's nothing like that on Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_17941015": "When Vice wakes me up in the morning is probably the closest it comes...",
  "str_quest_chat_17941016": "Oh. When does she do that? I'd like to see it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17941017": "It's better that you don't.",
  "str_quest_chat_17951001": "Morning. You got up early today.",
  "str_quest_chat_17951002": "Do you want to check out the early morning flowers with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_17951003": "Early morning flowers? Sounds interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_17951004": "Feel free to come see me, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_17951005": "Sure, I'll be right there... Hold it!",
  "str_quest_chat_17951006": "Are you planting flowers on Soroz again?",
  "str_quest_chat_17952001": "The sun is out again...",
  "str_quest_chat_17952002": "It's suddenly much warmer by the window now.",
  "str_quest_chat_17952003": "Good morning, Dawn. Have you eaten breakfast yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_17952004": "I'll go eat just as soon as I'm done taking care of this flower... I'm sure they enjoy the warmth even more than I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_17952005": "Just to make sure, may I ask that...",
  "str_quest_chat_17952006": "You remember the way to the kitchen, right? Or do you need my help getting there?",
  "str_quest_chat_17952007": "I remember!",
  "str_quest_chat_17952008": "That's good...",
  "str_quest_chat_17953001": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_17953002": "It's morning now, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_17953003": "Yes, that's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_17953004": "How did you know that, Dawn?",
  "str_quest_chat_17953005": "I felt the warmth of the sun on my body.",
  "str_quest_chat_17953006": "It wasn't chilly like it is at night, nor did it possess the blazing heat characterstic of midday.",
  "str_quest_chat_17953007": "It was a warmth that felt like a feather caressing my skin.",
  "str_quest_chat_17953008": "It's comfortable, I like it.",
  "str_quest_chat_17954001": "Good morning. Did I wake you up?",
  "str_quest_chat_17954002": "No, I was already up.",
  "str_quest_chat_17954003": "Can I message you more often?",
  "str_quest_chat_17954004": "Sure, anytime.",
  "str_quest_chat_17954005": "I'm still trying to learn how to type...",
  "str_quest_chat_17954006": "So I'll probably be a little slow...",
  "str_quest_chat_17954007": "It's okay, take it easy. I can wait.",
  "str_quest_chat_17954008": "Thank you. You're so nice.",
  "str_quest_chat_17955001": "No wind today... What should I do?",
  "str_quest_chat_17955002": "Ah, you can't find your way with the bells now.",
  "str_quest_chat_17955003": "The bells aren't moving at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_17955004": "As if they were dead.",
  "str_quest_chat_17955005": "You don't have to be so pessimistic...",
  "str_quest_chat_17955006": "I'll come over.",
  "str_quest_chat_17955007": "Let me be your eyes for the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_17955008": "Really? You will be with me the whole day?",
  "str_quest_chat_17955009": "Yes. I'm coming right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_17955010": "What a nice day today.",
  "str_quest_chat_17956001": "How's the sun?",
  "str_quest_chat_17956002": "Shining brightly.",
  "str_quest_chat_17956003": "Not much sunlight.",
  "str_quest_chat_17956004": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_17956005": "Are you still concerned with the lighting for dawn flowers?",
  "str_quest_chat_17956006": "I don't know much about flowers, but I think some like sunlight and some don't?",
  "str_quest_chat_17956007": "That's not a concern.",
  "str_quest_chat_17956008": "Dawn flowers are very resilient.",
  "str_quest_chat_17956009": "They can survive on just a bit of sunlight and dewdrop.",
  "str_quest_chat_17956010": "They will bloom even through cracks in a rock.",
  "str_quest_chat_17956011": "Wow, very admirable.",
  "str_quest_chat_17957001": "Morning. Have you seen Eve?",
  "str_quest_chat_17957002": "No. Is it urgent for you to see her?",
  "str_quest_chat_17957003": "No, I just want to hang out with her...",
  "str_quest_chat_17957004": "I can hang out with you. What do you two do, usually?",
  "str_quest_chat_17957005": "Take a walk, snuggle, do some gardening, tell stories...",
  "str_quest_chat_17957006": "Let's go take a stroll, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_17957007": "The walk and storytelling happen at the same time.",
  "str_quest_chat_17957008": "Normally, it's Eve telling a story to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_17957009": "Oh. Wait here while I go grab a storybook...",
  "str_quest_chat_17958001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_17958002": "I'm having a picnic with Eve today. Would you like to join us?",
  "str_quest_chat_17958003": "Are you sure you don't mind me there with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_17958004": "You're our friends too.",
  "str_quest_chat_17958005": "The honor is all mine.",
  "str_quest_chat_17958006": "Do I need to bring anything?",
  "str_quest_chat_17958007": "Food, drink, dining ware, chairs, other picnic essentials as well as transportation for three people.",
  "str_quest_chat_17958008": "In other words, I'm bringing everything...",
  "str_quest_chat_17961001": "Afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_17961002": "Afternoon, Dawn.",
  "str_quest_chat_17961003": "Eve gave me a present today.",
  "str_quest_chat_17961004": "Bye then.",
  "str_quest_chat_17961005": "... Did you just come to show off?!",
  "str_quest_chat_17981001": "The arrival of night always makes me feel better.",
  "str_quest_chat_17981002": "Every night, when the sounds of the day finally return to silence...",
  "str_quest_chat_17981003": "I can even hear the sound of flower buds blooming.",
  "str_quest_chat_17981004": "Wow... That's amazing, Dawn.",
  "str_quest_chat_17981005": "The dawn flowers you're breeding are beautiful, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_17981006": "You think so, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_17981007": "Then it seems my gardening skills have improved.",
  "str_quest_chat_17981008": "Although ever since that night... I've never been able to see the flowers planted by my own hand.",
  "str_quest_chat_17981009": "I... I'm sorry, Dawn... I didn't...",
  "str_quest_chat_17981010": "But... If you think they look beautiful... Then Eve would probably like them even more, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_17981011": "I'll have to plant even more flowers then. Goodbye!",
  "str_quest_chat_17982001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_17982002": "Good evening, Dawn.",
  "str_quest_chat_17982003": "I'm on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_17982004": "This late? What are you doing there?",
  "str_quest_chat_17982005": "When I'm on the Bridge, it feels like I'm really close to the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_17982006": "I can hear the sound of the wind blowing past the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_17982007": "I feel peaceful and secure here... It's perfect for thinking things over.",
  "str_quest_chat_17982008": "Oh... Okay. Just don't stay up too late, alright?",
  "str_quest_chat_17982009": "Same to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18001001": "You must be the one running this place, right, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_18001002": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_18001003": "As Soroz's Navigator, I guess you can call that part of the job description, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_18001004": "I'm just a navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18001005": "I still don't understand your position even now. But you are the one in charge, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_18001006": "You could say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_18001007": "Wonderful. You know I work odd jobs, but unlike you, I don't stick my nose into everything.",
  "str_quest_chat_18001008": "If the tasks get too complicated, you'd better be ready...",
  "str_quest_chat_18001009": "Be ready?",
  "str_quest_chat_18001010": "In other words, pay more!",
  "str_quest_chat_18001011": "Pay more?",
  "str_quest_chat_18001012": "Yes! I didn't turn you down and gave you room to negotiate only because you're in charge here.",
  "str_quest_chat_18001013": "So make sure you're sincere when mulling how much more to pay.",
  "str_quest_chat_18001014": "But I didn't ask you to help out with anything...",
  "str_quest_chat_18001015": "Not explicitly, but it was obvious you needed help!",
  "str_quest_chat_18001016": "This feels like an extortion somehow...",
  "str_quest_chat_18051001": "Sometimes, I really want to hire you as a helper.",
  "str_quest_chat_18051002": "Huh? Why not?",
  "str_quest_chat_18051003": "Your ability would surely come in handy in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_18051004": "Like what...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18051005": "Like looking for lost kittens and doggies.",
  "str_quest_chat_18051006": "Is that so...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18051007": "Hey, people pay big bucks for that, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_18051008": "So you used to find lost kittens... Taki with a cat... hmmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_18051009": "Humph! I'm leaving!",
  "str_quest_chat_18061001": "I always feel so sleepy when the afternoon rolls around...",
  "str_quest_chat_18061002": "Yeah, me the same...",
  "str_quest_chat_18061003": "Huh? I can say that, but you're way too young to feel that way, kid! What makes you always so tired?",
  "str_quest_chat_18061004": "Maybe you just need a certain pick-me-up...? Nah, you're still too soft.",
  "str_quest_chat_18061005": "Huh? A pick-me-up?",
  "str_quest_chat_18061006": "It's not for you, that's for sure... And besides, the only way to get it on the Colossus is to make it ourselves.",
  "str_quest_chat_18061007": "...I know what you're talking about! It was you last time, wasn't it?!",
  "str_quest_chat_18061008": "You started a fire in your room, and nearly lit up the entire Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_18061009": "What are you talking about, kiddo? I put out the fire right away! Besides, how could a tiny, little fire like that do anything to the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_18061010": "So you admit it! It was you all along!",
  "str_quest_chat_18061011": "S-See ya!",
  "str_quest_chat_18062001": "Afternoon. I left some vouchers at your door.",
  "str_quest_chat_18062002": "Wait, what vouchers?",
  "str_quest_chat_18062003": "Discount vouchers for Odd Jobs.",
  "str_quest_chat_18062004": "Just bring the voucher over and I'll give you a discount.",
  "str_quest_chat_18062005": "Taki, have you been hanging around Kleken lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_18062006": "Well, as traders, we do talk shop.",
  "str_quest_chat_18062007": "Also, I've placed vouchers in front of everyone's door.",
  "str_quest_chat_18062008": "... And here I was thinking it was a gift just for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_18063001": "Hey, any jobs today?",
  "str_quest_chat_18063002": "None.",
  "str_quest_chat_18063003": "What's for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_18063004": "You sure that's the job? Then pay up first.",
  "str_quest_chat_18063005": "Uh, never mind, I got no job for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18063006": "Nothing to look into for someone as inscrutable as you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18063007": "You think I'm inscrutable?",
  "str_quest_chat_18063008": "Isn't being the sole Caelestite in the world inscrutable enough?",
  "str_quest_chat_18063009": "Actually, I'm a simple person.",
  "str_quest_chat_18063010": "If that was true, there wouldn't be so many people looking into you behind your back.",
  "str_quest_chat_18063011": "What? I don't feel safe all of a sudden...",
  "str_quest_chat_18064001": "Do you think I may be a Caelestite, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_18064002": "Huh? What made you say that?",
  "str_quest_chat_18064003": "Don't you Caelestites have some sort of psychic bond between you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18064004": "But I never sense anything like that from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18064005": "Don't you think my necklace looks familiar?",
  "str_quest_chat_18064006": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_18064007": "How come you don't know a thing!",
  "str_quest_chat_18064008": "Never mind. I guess the necklace really doesn't have anything to do with the Caelestites.",
  "str_quest_chat_18065001": "Come on, let's go take a dip.",
  "str_quest_chat_18065002": "Now?",
  "str_quest_chat_18065003": "We'll just get some fresh air then.",
  "str_quest_chat_18065004": "What's with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18065005": "That's the only two ways that men show friendship, dummy.",
  "str_quest_chat_18065006": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_18065007": "You're still green.",
  "str_quest_chat_18066001": "Nice place you got here.",
  "str_quest_chat_18066002": "You mean the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_18066003": "Yeah. This is one of the rare spots where I feel relaxed.",
  "str_quest_chat_18066004": "Open, bright, completely different than Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_18066005": "Yet you, the operator seemed...",
  "str_quest_chat_18066006": "What, physically weak?",
  "str_quest_chat_18066007": "Whoa, don't put words in my mouth.",
  "str_quest_chat_18067001": "What kind of person do you think PlayerName is?",
  "str_quest_chat_18067002": "???",
  "str_quest_chat_18067003": "Are you asking me what kind of person I am?",
  "str_quest_chat_18067004": "I've been hired to look into you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18067005": "Really? Who hired you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18067006": "Odd Jobs never divulges client identity.",
  "str_quest_chat_18067007": "You can tell me, I promise not to tell anyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_18067008": "A knucklehead and not worth the effort, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_18067009": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_18081001": "Still working this late, kid?",
  "str_quest_chat_18081002": "Any lingering issues?",
  "str_quest_chat_18081003": "There're a lot of things to worry about on Soroz, so it's normal to work into the night.",
  "str_quest_chat_18081004": "Well, if you'd like to go to bed early, you can give me some of the work.",
  "str_quest_chat_18081005": "But with pay, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_18081006": "That's quite all right, then!",
  "str_quest_chat_18082001": "Go to bed, kid. Don't stay up so late.",
  "str_quest_chat_18082002": "I'm just about to do that. What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18082003": "It's still way too early for it to be my bedtime.",
  "str_quest_chat_18082004": "So what are you up to?",
  "str_quest_chat_18082005": "I'm just... temporarily withdrawing from my duties... And indulging in the night.",
  "str_quest_chat_18082006": "Uh... indulging? Are you feeling okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_18082007": "Of course, I am! This is how I normally feel right before going to work.",
  "str_quest_chat_18082008": "Now go get some sleep. Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_18082009": "O-Okay... Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_18083001": "Evening! I've been thinking about something lately...",
  "str_quest_chat_18083002": "Good evening, Taki. What's on your mind?",
  "str_quest_chat_18083003": "I think you should hire me to do some work for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18083004": "I can make this Colossus a lot more comfortable, if you do!",
  "str_quest_chat_18083005": "Even though I know this could never end well...",
  "str_quest_chat_18083006": "But what exactly do you have in mind?",
  "str_quest_chat_18083007": "First, I would install a water pool in a certain room.",
  "str_quest_chat_18083008": "Then, I'd fill it with the purest, warmest, most comfortable spring water...",
  "str_quest_chat_18083009": "And then, soon enough, I'd be able to start the most famous hot spring business right here on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_18083010": "...I can't let you open a sauna on the Colossus, Taki.",
  "str_quest_chat_18083011": "And before you start coming up with counter-arguments...",
  "str_quest_chat_18083012": "I'm going to bed right now. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_18083013": "I won't give up that easily, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_18101001": "How come you have no ears, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18101002": "What? I got ears!",
  "str_quest_chat_18101003": "I mean the long ones.",
  "str_quest_chat_18101004": "Not everyone has long ears.",
  "str_quest_chat_18101005": "I see. I was wondering why people would stare at my ears.",
  "str_quest_chat_18101006": "Some would even like to touch them. What do you think of my ears, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18101007": "I think they're cute.",
  "str_quest_chat_18101008": "So you're fine with them!",
  "str_quest_chat_18101009": "Good, good.",
  "str_quest_chat_18101010": "They're kind of unusual...",
  "str_quest_chat_18101011": "Is that what you think, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18101012": "No, no, I meant that as in \"unique.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_18101013": "So you're fine with them!",
  "str_quest_chat_18101014": "Good, good.",
  "str_quest_chat_18151001": "Are you awake, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18151002": "Yes, I'm up. What can I do for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18151003": "Do you want to hang out with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_18151004": "Sorry, I have to pilot the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_18151005": "I see... What a shame.",
  "str_quest_chat_18151006": "I was looking forward to another continental cruise.",
  "str_quest_chat_18151007": "What is that?!",
  "str_quest_chat_18152001": "Morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18152002": "Perfect weather for adventures today!",
  "str_quest_chat_18152003": "Going on adventures again?",
  "str_quest_chat_18152004": "Yeah! You and me, just like last time?",
  "str_quest_chat_18152005": "I can't keep up with your pace...",
  "str_quest_chat_18152006": "You're still young, how can you be like my parents?",
  "str_quest_chat_18152007": "Ahem, it's because you're more than a handful...",
  "str_quest_chat_18153001": "I made snow biscuits for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18153002": "Is that food?",
  "str_quest_chat_18153003": "It's snow stuffed inside ice.",
  "str_quest_chat_18153004": "Wouldn't that be a handful of snow?",
  "str_quest_chat_18153005": "No! I made it with the snow elf!",
  "str_quest_chat_18153006": "Snow elf?",
  "str_quest_chat_18153007": "The mini-snowman I made.",
  "str_quest_chat_18153008": "Well, then it makes two handfuls of snow...",
  "str_quest_chat_18154001": "Wow, the breakfast is yummy today!",
  "str_quest_chat_18154002": "I ate enough to have a food baby!",
  "str_quest_chat_18154003": "You should eat more since you're still growing.",
  "str_quest_chat_18154004": "Aren't you still growing too, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18154005": "Did you eat enough to have a food baby?",
  "str_quest_chat_18154006": "Yeah, it's round enough!",
  "str_quest_chat_18154007": "Let me pat it!",
  "str_quest_chat_18154008": "I'm in great shape!",
  "str_quest_chat_18154009": "Really? Let me check...",
  "str_quest_chat_18154010": "That's not necessary...",
  "str_quest_chat_18155001": "Morning, honorable Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18155002": "Morning, Alice. Why so formal?",
  "str_quest_chat_18155003": "I am the Knight of Spades, a friend of Alice.",
  "str_quest_chat_18155004": "Uh, okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_18155005": "How rude of you to not greet me!",
  "str_quest_chat_18155006": "And you are...",
  "str_quest_chat_18155007": "I'm the esteemed Queen of Hearts!",
  "str_quest_chat_18155008": "All right, all right. Morning, Queen of Hearts.",
  "str_quest_chat_18155009": "I order you to hang out with Alice right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_18155010": "Or lose your head!",
  "str_quest_chat_18155011": "I'm scared out of my wits...",
  "str_quest_chat_18156001": "Snore...",
  "str_quest_chat_18156002": "Are you awake or asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_18156003": "I'm imitating you sleeping, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18156004": "I don't snore...",
  "str_quest_chat_18156005": "But I heard you clearly when I sneaked into your room...",
  "str_quest_chat_18156006": "When was that?!",
  "str_quest_chat_18156007": "Heh, nothing!",
  "str_quest_chat_18156008": "How do you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_18156009": "Uh, just a guess. I never sneaked into your room, ever.",
  "str_quest_chat_18156010": "I'm smelling a fish...",
  "str_quest_chat_18157001": "Will you be buying new books soon, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18157002": "What would you like to read?",
  "str_quest_chat_18157003": "Anything. I love to read.",
  "str_quest_chat_18157004": "There are a lot of books on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_18157005": "I've read them all.",
  "str_quest_chat_18157006": "All of them?",
  "str_quest_chat_18157007": "Yes, and you have a rather eccentric taste, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18157008": "How to Prove You're Not an Aurorian, A Brief History of Breakfast, Engine Repair for Dummies...",
  "str_quest_chat_18157009": "All right, all right, I'll take you to buy books.",
  "str_quest_chat_18161001": "Navigator! I brought a rabbit on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_18161002": "A rabbit?",
  "str_quest_chat_18161003": "Yeah, you know, a bunny that goes hop, hop, hop!",
  "str_quest_chat_18161004": "It should be on the bridge now!",
  "str_quest_chat_18161005": "Would it cause you trouble?",
  "str_quest_chat_18161006": "Not really, but I'm concerned about its safety.",
  "str_quest_chat_18161007": "Safe?",
  "str_quest_chat_18161008": "If the rabbit somehow got out of the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_18161009": "It may fall...",
  "str_quest_chat_18161010": "Oh! I can't have that! I'm gonna go find it. Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_18162001": "Good afternoon, Mr. Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18162002": "Would you like to have a tea party with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_18162003": "Sure! What can I do to help, Alice?",
  "str_quest_chat_18162004": "Oh, I've got everything ready.",
  "str_quest_chat_18162005": "An exquisite tea set, piping hot tea, and delicious treats.",
  "str_quest_chat_18162006": "But if you want to do something you could bring your favorite storybook.",
  "str_quest_chat_18181001": "It's finally time for bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_18181002": "Hey, Navigator, do you have any good bedtime stories to tell?",
  "str_quest_chat_18181003": "Hmm... Let me think.",
  "str_quest_chat_18181004": "Once, there was a little Caelestite girl named Ada...",
  "str_quest_chat_18181005": "I know! That's Ada and the Colossus, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_18181006": "I've read that one before!",
  "str_quest_chat_18181007": "It's about a new Navigator and her mini-Colossus, and they are traveling all over the world!",
  "str_quest_chat_18181008": "They're so cool! I've always wanted to be like Ada and travel the world, all my life!",
  "str_quest_chat_18181009": "You sure have read a lot of books, Alice...",
  "str_quest_chat_18181010": "Thank you, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18181011": "Sure, but... I haven't done anything...",
  "str_quest_chat_18181012": "Yeah, but you reminded me of my favorite story!",
  "str_quest_chat_18181013": "Now I can go to bed feeling even happier!",
  "str_quest_chat_18181014": "Good night, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18181015": "Good night, Alice.",
  "str_quest_chat_18182001": "Navigator, sir. Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_18182002": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_18182003": "Why aren't you in bed, Alice?",
  "str_quest_chat_18182004": "Hehe, I'll go to bed once I arrange my ears.",
  "str_quest_chat_18182005": "... Arrange?",
  "str_quest_chat_18182006": "Why are you asking like that?",
  "str_quest_chat_18182007": "Because I have bunny ears, you know. I need to set them properly before going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_18182008": "It'd be troublesome if I were to squish them in my sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_18182009": "That's true...",
  "str_quest_chat_18183001": "Mr. Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18183002": "What's wrong, Alice? You look sad.",
  "str_quest_chat_18183003": "Is it true that monsters hide under the bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_18183004": "It's a terrifying thought. Look, my ears are standing up on end!",
  "str_quest_chat_18183005": "Don't worry. It's not true at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_18183006": "I've never seen a monster under a bed, and you know how old I am!",
  "str_quest_chat_18183007": "I want to go and check. But it's so dark under there. I'm too scared to look.",
  "str_quest_chat_18183008": "Why don't I send a Firefly over?",
  "str_quest_chat_18183009": "The Firefly can shine a light under the bed so you can see if there's anything there.",
  "str_quest_chat_18183010": "Thanks, Mr. Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18201001": "As always... you have my gratitude...",
  "str_quest_chat_18201002": "It's fine, no need to be so polite!",
  "str_quest_chat_18201003": "C-Can I ask you a question?",
  "str_quest_chat_18201004": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18201005": "Lumopolis, or the True Order... Which would you say you like more?",
  "str_quest_chat_18201006": "Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_18201007": "The True Order.",
  "str_quest_chat_18201008": "C-Can I know the reason?",
  "str_quest_chat_18201009": "No reason in particular. It was just the first answer that came to mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_18201010": "What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18201011": "By choosing one... that means I prefer living there, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_18201012": "Uh, sure?",
  "str_quest_chat_18201013": "Right...",
  "str_quest_chat_18201014": "T-Then I... I choose the same as you, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_18201015": "That's good, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18201016": "I-Is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18201017": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_18201018": "Oh... Then that's good.",
  "str_quest_chat_18202001": "I-I didn't mean to disturb you...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202002": "Disturb me? What are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat_18202003": "I'm not disturbing you, contacting you like this...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18202004": "Of course you're not.",
  "str_quest_chat_18202005": "Well, that's good then...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202006": "What's on your mind, Beryl?",
  "str_quest_chat_18202007": "Recently, I... I've had some problems...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202008": "But I don't know if... anyone else could understand them...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202009": "If you ever have any problems, you can always tell me.",
  "str_quest_chat_18202010": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202011": "I feel as though... life on the Colossus is very uneventful and ordinary...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202012": "Ah... Well, come to think of it, it can get pretty boring after you've been here for a long time.",
  "str_quest_chat_18202013": "No... That's not it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18202014": "In fact, I...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202015": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_18202016": "What I mean is, life here is comfortable, peaceful, day after day...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202017": "I-I'm just afraid...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202018": "Afraid? You're afraid we may soon find ourselves back on the battlefield?",
  "str_quest_chat_18202019": "I'm not worried about fighting...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202020": "I-I'm just... afraid of losing this ordinary life forever.",
  "str_quest_chat_18202021": "So, I wanted to ask you... Can you try to keep things like this all the time?",
  "str_quest_chat_18202022": "Of course, I promise I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_18202023": "Good...",
  "str_quest_chat_18202024": "Thank you very much...",
  "str_quest_chat_18241001": "Hmm... You know...",
  "str_quest_chat_18241002": "You're not really like the others...",
  "str_quest_chat_18241003": "What's different about me?",
  "str_quest_chat_18241004": "You're... not afraid of it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18241005": "I know you wouldn't let it hurt me.",
  "str_quest_chat_18241006": "You shouldn't be afraid, either. Soroz and I will protect you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18241007": "So please think of this place as your home too, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_18241008": "Really? I can have a place to call home, too...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18241009": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_18241010": "And home... is a place where you can ask me for anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_18241011": "I see... W-Well... I am a little hungry...",
  "str_quest_chat_18241012": "Are you? Okay, I got it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18241013": "B-But... Just a little...",
  "str_quest_chat_18241014": "Just a second. I'll go make you something to eat!",
  "str_quest_chat_18241015": "T-Thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_18242001": "The crystals... are increasing in numbers...",
  "str_quest_chat_18242002": "Complex and intertwining... never receding...",
  "str_quest_chat_18242003": "Does it hurt?",
  "str_quest_chat_18242004": "My body...? No...",
  "str_quest_chat_18242005": "Its ability and vitality have become stronger and more vigorous than ever...",
  "str_quest_chat_18242006": "Its range has also increased...",
  "str_quest_chat_18242007": "Most people choose to leave because they're afraid of it...",
  "str_quest_chat_18242008": "Don't say that, Beryl...",
  "str_quest_chat_18242009": "If it were not for those crystals, I wouldn't have met you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18242010": "The power of the crystals may bring you pain, but it has also brought you new friends, hasn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18242011": "Friends...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18242012": "But...",
  "str_quest_chat_18242013": "Beryl, just listen to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_18242014": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_18242015": "You may not be able to put the pieces of your shattered past back together, but you can forge a new future with the power you have now, and use it to protect the things you care about.",
  "str_quest_chat_18242016": "The more you use you crystals for good, the closer together you'll bring us all. United, we can inspire the world for the better.",
  "str_quest_chat_18242017": "United...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18242018": "You won't get scared and run away from me...? You'll try to understand me, is that what you mean...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18242019": "Yes, that's right. That's what friends do.",
  "str_quest_chat_18242020": "I...",
  "str_quest_chat_18242021": "I'll try to... do the best I can...",
  "str_quest_chat_18251001": "*Yawns*... Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_18251002": "Good morning. You don't sound too cheery this morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_18251003": "Just another new day... I can't tell if it'll be a new beginning, or just more of the same grind...",
  "str_quest_chat_18251004": "Sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat_18251005": "Hope you have a nice day.",
  "str_quest_chat_18251006": "Thanks, same to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18252001": "Good morning. It's another new day...",
  "str_quest_chat_18252002": "Morning. Have you had breakfast yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_18252003": "I've eaten... But I should've let you know...",
  "str_quest_chat_18252004": "It's not a big deal.",
  "str_quest_chat_18252005": "What are you planning on doing today?",
  "str_quest_chat_18252006": "Fighting... or perhaps doing nothing...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18252007": "Forget it... I hope you have a nice day...",
  "str_quest_chat_18252008": "I have somewhere else to be...",
  "str_quest_chat_18252009": "Alright. I hope you have a good day, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_18253001": "Morning... The sun is so bright today...",
  "str_quest_chat_18253002": "You should get up and do some training...",
  "str_quest_chat_18253003": "Urgh... I'm so sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_18253004": "Would you like to train together, Beryl?",
  "str_quest_chat_18253005": "Good luck, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18253006": "I need to... go...",
  "str_quest_chat_18253007": "Huh? Are you still there?",
  "str_quest_chat_18254001": "The old day has passed, and a new one has arrived.",
  "str_quest_chat_18254002": "Yes. Good morning, Beryl.",
  "str_quest_chat_18254003": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_18254004": "Any plans for today?",
  "str_quest_chat_18254005": "Plans? Let me think...",
  "str_quest_chat_18254006": "Perhaps I'll go to Umbraton and buy some books.",
  "str_quest_chat_18254007": "Vice says we need more books on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_18254008": "You're welcome to join me if you'd like, Beryl.",
  "str_quest_chat_18254009": "May I?",
  "str_quest_chat_18254010": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_18254011": "As long as that doesn't bore you...",
  "str_quest_chat_18254012": "Thank you...",
  "str_quest_chat_18255001": "Good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_18255002": "Morning, Beryl!",
  "str_quest_chat_18255003": "Thank you for making such a scrumptious breakfast...",
  "str_quest_chat_18255004": "ANd even getting Fireflies to deliver it to my room...",
  "str_quest_chat_18255005": "Uh, wait, I didn't send them.",
  "str_quest_chat_18255006": "It's probably another friend of yours, not me.",
  "str_quest_chat_18255007": "Friend...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18255008": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_18255009": "This is good, Beryl.",
  "str_quest_chat_18255010": "Even if right now, you don't know the sender's identity...",
  "str_quest_chat_18255011": "At least someone on the Colossus thinks of you as a friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_18255012": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_18255013": "I understand now, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18255014": "I will... keep an eye out.",
  "str_quest_chat_18255015": "Yup!",
  "str_quest_chat_18256001": "G-good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_18256002": "Morning, Beryl.",
  "str_quest_chat_18256003": "Today... I'm going out to play...",
  "str_quest_chat_18256004": "Going out to play? What do you have in mind?",
  "str_quest_chat_18256005": "I was thinking... about going fishing...",
  "str_quest_chat_18256006": "Wow, that's great.",
  "str_quest_chat_18256007": "I don't really know how to fish. But, since you're cheering me on...",
  "str_quest_chat_18256008": "Well, I'll definitely do my best today!",
  "str_quest_chat_18256009": "Nice! I believe in you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18261001": "That cloud got smaller.",
  "str_quest_chat_18261002": "What cloud.",
  "str_quest_chat_18261003": "The one outside the Lounge window.",
  "str_quest_chat_18261004": "It was big just a second ago.",
  "str_quest_chat_18261005": "I was distracted, then looked back and it got smaller.",
  "str_quest_chat_18261006": "Clouds could decay too, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_18261007": "Uh, more like parts of it dispersed...",
  "str_quest_chat_18262001": "The flower cake in the Cafe...",
  "str_quest_chat_18262002": "You like it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18262003": "I'm afraid to try it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18262004": "I don't want to ruin the perfection.",
  "str_quest_chat_18262005": "It's okay, it's just a cake.",
  "str_quest_chat_18262006": "You can eat it any time you want.",
  "str_quest_chat_18262007": "But it's seasonal.",
  "str_quest_chat_18262008": "Sure enough, perfections are few and far between.",
  "str_quest_chat_18263001": "If I get rid of the Sanguine Crystal...",
  "str_quest_chat_18263002": "Will I gain serenity?",
  "str_quest_chat_18263003": "I have no answer to that.",
  "str_quest_chat_18263004": "Do you know who does?",
  "str_quest_chat_18263005": "Don't tell me it's myself. That's what everybody said.",
  "str_quest_chat_18263006": "I wouldn't ask if I had the answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_18263007": "Sorry, I don't know that either. Maybe some questions just have no answers.",
  "str_quest_chat_18263008": "That's okay. Just chatting with you gives me peace.",
  "str_quest_chat_18264001": "Do you have any painful memories?",
  "str_quest_chat_18264002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_18264003": "How can the pain be forgotten?",
  "str_quest_chat_18264004": "Perhaps only time can heal all pain.",
  "str_quest_chat_18264005": "But I think I'm stuck in time.",
  "str_quest_chat_18264006": "It's all in the past...",
  "str_quest_chat_18264007": "I envy you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18264008": "Hope you can leave the pain behind one day.",
  "str_quest_chat_18264009": "That day may never come...",
  "str_quest_chat_18265001": "There's much darkness in my life.",
  "str_quest_chat_18265002": "Did you open the curtain?",
  "str_quest_chat_18265003": "Light cannot brighten my heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_18265004": "Your heart is in you, of course the light cannot reach it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18265005": "Do you think you're funny?",
  "str_quest_chat_18265006": "Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat_18265007": "I think you're funny too.",
  "str_quest_chat_18265008": "Thanks. I feel much better after talking to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18265009": "Good... I was afraid I was in trouble...",
  "str_quest_chat_18266001": "I feel somewhat empty inside.",
  "str_quest_chat_18266002": "The old memories...",
  "str_quest_chat_18266003": "Is the past coming back again?",
  "str_quest_chat_18266004": "The memories are starting to get hazy.",
  "str_quest_chat_18266005": "I can't leave the sorrow behind.",
  "str_quest_chat_18266006": "Yet the sorrow seems to be leaving on its own.",
  "str_quest_chat_18266007": "I don't get it, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_18266008": "That sounds like a good thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_18281001": "Resting already?",
  "str_quest_chat_18281002": "Just lay down for a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat_18281003": "I'm not very sleepy, though. What about you, Beryl?",
  "str_quest_chat_18281004": "Me either.",
  "str_quest_chat_18281005": "You don't want to take a break, Beryl?",
  "str_quest_chat_18281006": "I'm... I'm pulling an all-nighter.",
  "str_quest_chat_18281007": "You still have work to finish? If it's not urgent, wouldn't it be better to take care of it tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat_18281008": "Then again, I stay up late pretty often, too...",
  "str_quest_chat_18281009": "Is it because you don't want today to end... Or because you don't want to deal with tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat_18281010": "No, it's just because I have a lot of work to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_18281011": "Work, huh... Sounds like a pretty stable life...",
  "str_quest_chat_18281012": "Or maybe... Staying busy with work makes you feel secure. Is that it, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_18281013": "I suppose it is kind of fulfilling... But to be honest, it'd be great if I had more people around to help me do the work.",
  "str_quest_chat_18281014": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_18281015": "Er, b-but that's just how I feel sometimes! I wouldn't shirk my duties or anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_18282001": "You should be resting at such a late hour...",
  "str_quest_chat_18282002": "You should also be getting ready for bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_18282003": "I caught you...",
  "str_quest_chat_18282004": "Caught me?",
  "str_quest_chat_18282005": "Your sleep schedule is so erratic... Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18282006": "I just came to check... whether you were resting...",
  "str_quest_chat_18282007": "Well, then... Let's both rest early.",
  "str_quest_chat_18282008": "Good night, Beryl.",
  "str_quest_chat_18282009": "Good night...",
  "str_quest_chat_18283001": "Late at night, my crystals...",
  "str_quest_chat_18283002": "Huh? What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_18283003": "Under the glow of the Fireflies' light, they sparkle with so many different colors...",
  "str_quest_chat_18283004": "You can shine too, Beryl.",
  "str_quest_chat_18283005": "I can... shine?",
  "str_quest_chat_18283006": "Sure. You just need to go to sleep early, and you'll be shining with energy tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_18283007": "Oh... I see. Good night...",
  "str_quest_chat_18283008": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_18284001": "I can't even count how many nights it has been...",
  "str_quest_chat_18284002": "What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_18284003": "I just feel as though these warm and tranquil nights will one day disappear forever...",
  "str_quest_chat_18284004": "It would be best to make a record of these days...",
  "str_quest_chat_18284005": "Well... I prefer to think there are still countless peaceful nights in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_18284006": "And as long as you live on the Colossus, nights like this will always exist.",
  "str_quest_chat_18284007": "But right now, what matters the most is getting some sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_18284008": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_18284009": "Sweet dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_18284010": "You too.",
  "str_quest_chat_18285001": "Good evening, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18285002": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_18285003": "What are you doing...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18285004": "I'm reading.",
  "str_quest_chat_18285005": "Reading a book...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18285006": "Speaking of that... I noticed some new books on the shelves lately...",
  "str_quest_chat_18285007": "I didn't notice. What kind of books?",
  "str_quest_chat_18285008": "Uh, the kind I like...",
  "str_quest_chat_18285009": "You mean somebody else is into the same things as you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18285010": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_18285011": "Yes, so I would like to find out who that is...",
  "str_quest_chat_18285012": "And I've been observing in secret.",
  "str_quest_chat_18285013": "Pfft...",
  "str_quest_chat_18285014": "I'll tell the Fireflies to keep an eye out for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18285015": "Oh, I'm so very thankful, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18285016": "Don't sweat it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18285017": "How about you get some sleep now?",
  "str_quest_chat_18285018": "Yes... Good night, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18285019": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_18286001": "Good evening...",
  "str_quest_chat_18286002": "I feel like... you've been working really hard lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_18286003": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_18286004": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_18286005": "Well, a little bit.",
  "str_quest_chat_18286006": "Then... It might be best for you to turn in early...",
  "str_quest_chat_18286007": "I see. Thanks for your concern, Beryl.",
  "str_quest_chat_18286008": "Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_18286009": "Alright, goodnight...",
  "str_quest_chat_18301001": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_18301002": "Playing the piano.",
  "str_quest_chat_18301003": "But it's pointless...",
  "str_quest_chat_18301004": "Nothing...",
  "str_quest_chat_18301005": "Hmm? Why are you doing what I do, all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_18301006": "What's the problem? You love music, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18301007": "Do you think... my music is pleasing to the ears?",
  "str_quest_chat_18301008": "Yeah, I can sense profound emotions in your music.",
  "str_quest_chat_18301009": "Then... Why is it that some people just don't understand?",
  "str_quest_chat_18301010": "You mean people in Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_18301011": "Yeah, more or less.",
  "str_quest_chat_18301012": "Maybe some people just instinctively reject new things?",
  "str_quest_chat_18301013": "Ah... So that's it!",
  "str_quest_chat_18301014": "I mean, how could people who blindly follow conventions tell the difference between genius and mediocrity!",
  "str_quest_chat_18301015": "Only genius can understand and appreciate genius, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18301016": "Come, Navigator! Now is the time to play an endless piece just for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18301017": "W-Wait! Clam down and stay back!!",
  "str_quest_chat_18341001": "The voice of the divine is the sound of the divine—it makes my music all the more penetrating and enrapturing.",
  "str_quest_chat_18341002": "I have been doing some research lately, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18341003": "Oh? What research?",
  "str_quest_chat_18341004": "Oh no... Why do I have a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach about this?",
  "str_quest_chat_18341005": "I realized... that the piano on Soroz can't be moved!",
  "str_quest_chat_18341006": "What? Just what exactly are you up to?",
  "str_quest_chat_18341007": "Special people navigate a special being with special abilities. The piano they use should be special, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18341008": "Don't worry, I just want to try and see if it can be moved.",
  "str_quest_chat_18341009": "If it CAN be moved, you're just going to steal it, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18341010": "It's not stealing, it's borrowing!",
  "str_quest_chat_18341011": "Fine. Good thing it really can't be moved from its spot...",
  "str_quest_chat_18341012": "I have another question.",
  "str_quest_chat_18341013": "Do you prefer ribbons or batons?",
  "str_quest_chat_18341014": "Ribbons.",
  "str_quest_chat_18341015": "Batons.",
  "str_quest_chat_18341016": "Heehee, then I have some to share with you, and only you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18341017": "Actually... Neither of them are real.",
  "str_quest_chat_18341018": "If that's the case, how can you direct and conduct without one?",
  "str_quest_chat_18341019": "The notes and movements... have long since been engraved in my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_18351001": "A new day has begun with a new movement! Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_18351002": "Rehearsing this early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_18351003": "Oh my, you understand me so well, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18351004": "You just woke me up...",
  "str_quest_chat_18351005": "But being awoken by such joyous, divine music is a cause for celebration!",
  "str_quest_chat_18351006": "Ahaha... Yeah, no.",
  "str_quest_chat_18352001": "Awaken to the sound of music, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18352002": "I'm awake... I'm awake...",
  "str_quest_chat_18352003": "Hah! When you get to the bridge, you will find today's surprise!",
  "str_quest_chat_18352004": "This isn't a surprise...",
  "str_quest_chat_18352005": "Your Fireflies, arranged into beautiful bows and placed by the piano—it is a magnificent surprise, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18352006": "Next, I shall teach them how to sing the music flowing through my mind!",
  "str_quest_chat_18352007": "That way, you will be able to hear my music even when I am not with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18352008": "Let the Fireflies go, Bonacie...",
  "str_quest_chat_18353001": "Today, the one and only Bonacie is here to awaken you with morning greetings!",
  "str_quest_chat_18353002": "Morning, Bonacie.",
  "str_quest_chat_18353003": "Have you eaten breakfast, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18353004": "If you haven't eaten, I can make something especially for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18353005": "A custom breakfast meal, bathed in the glory of my divine song!",
  "str_quest_chat_18353006": "Sounds like it has some kind of magical effect, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18353007": "You really shouldn't have, Bonacie...",
  "str_quest_chat_18354001": "Ahh... Now that's what I call a good night's sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_18354002": "Morning, Bonacie.",
  "str_quest_chat_18354003": "My latest music piece seems to be really effective at putting listeners to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_18354004": "Hehehe... PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_18354005": "Would you like me to stand in front of your room tonight and play a song for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18354006": "That's nice of you, but I think I sleep pretty well.",
  "str_quest_chat_18354007": "Oh well, that's a shame.",
  "str_quest_chat_18355001": "♪Ding dong, ding dong, alarm clock goes ding dong♪",
  "str_quest_chat_18355002": "That's the alarm sound I adapted from a nursery rhyme.",
  "str_quest_chat_18355003": "That's cute, like a fairy tale...",
  "str_quest_chat_18355004": "Snore...",
  "str_quest_chat_18355005": "Stop dozing off again!",
  "str_quest_chat_18355006": "Heh, just playing with you. I'm awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_18355007": "Let's go play the piano, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18355008": "Uh, that was a joke. I'm not out of bed yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_18356001": "Hi, good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_18356002": "I'm going out to collect sounds.",
  "str_quest_chat_18356003": "Collect sounds?",
  "str_quest_chat_18356004": "Yeah, everything makes a sound.",
  "str_quest_chat_18356005": "Bubbling brooks, pine forests, birds, wheat fields...",
  "str_quest_chat_18356006": "Even the grunting people make when laboring sounds captivating, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18356007": "I can't help but praise the nature, now that you put it like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_18357001": "So...",
  "str_quest_chat_18357002": "Did my music disturb everyone?",
  "str_quest_chat_18357003": "Why do you ask?",
  "str_quest_chat_18357004": "I was really into playing in my room just a moment ago...",
  "str_quest_chat_18357005": "When a note was slipped under the door.",
  "str_quest_chat_18357006": "It read, \"Your music is too noisy!\"",
  "str_quest_chat_18357007": "Whoever it was was probably asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_18357008": "But it was time to rise, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18357009": "Maybe the person sleeps late.",
  "str_quest_chat_18357010": "Perhaps even stayed up all night and planned to sleep all day.",
  "str_quest_chat_18357011": "It's my fault to not taking everyone's preferences into consideration...",
  "str_quest_chat_18357012": "The person might not enjoy music.",
  "str_quest_chat_18357013": "I know who slipped the note then.",
  "str_quest_chat_18357014": "It must be one of the Lumopolis nobles!",
  "str_quest_chat_18358001": "It's pure joy to play music in the sky, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18358002": "But I don't play out in the public so casually.",
  "str_quest_chat_18358003": "What brought that on?",
  "str_quest_chat_18358004": "I was in the Cafe and someone would like me to play.",
  "str_quest_chat_18358005": "Although I'm tolerant of the spectrum of people from all walks of life living on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_18358006": "My music isn't for nobles, bookworms, and their ilk.",
  "str_quest_chat_18358007": "Why not?",
  "str_quest_chat_18358008": "They don't understand music at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_18359001": "Did you hear the music in the wind?",
  "str_quest_chat_18359002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_18359003": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_18359004": "It was spontaneous and resonated in and out.",
  "str_quest_chat_18359005": "It reminded me of starry skies and clear, reflecting brooks.",
  "str_quest_chat_18359006": "Does such amazing sound exist?",
  "str_quest_chat_18359007": "It must be sound from heaven, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18359008": "I am inspired all of a sudden!",
  "str_quest_chat_18359009": "Then I wish you a brilliant composition.",
  "str_quest_chat_18381001": "Good evening, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18381002": "On a deep, quiet night like this, playing classical music is the best.",
  "str_quest_chat_18381003": "Incredible... Why do you still have so much energy this late at night, Bonacie?",
  "str_quest_chat_18381004": "The divine grant me strength, that I may always be immersed in my emotions at all times...",
  "str_quest_chat_18381005": "What emotions?",
  "str_quest_chat_18381006": "If you must know...",
  "str_quest_chat_18381007": "Repeat after me! \"Lumopolites, Musical Neanderthals!\"",
  "str_quest_chat_18381008": "Lumopolites... Musical... Neanderthals...",
  "str_quest_chat_18382001": "Good night, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18382002": "I think that with your bounteous knowledge, you must know something about the great artists of this world, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18382003": "Hmm... I'm no expert...",
  "str_quest_chat_18382004": "You're very modest. I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_18382005": "Are you asking if I know about how great you are?",
  "str_quest_chat_18382006": "Ahahahaha!",
  "str_quest_chat_18382007": "It's hard not to agree with that, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18382008": "But what I meant was...",
  "str_quest_chat_18382009": "The greatest artists are only discovered by the world after their death.",
  "str_quest_chat_18382010": "However, the music of Lumopolis has changed over so many generations...",
  "str_quest_chat_18382011": "And there is not a single individual I consider to be a great artist!",
  "str_quest_chat_18382012": "The artists of Lumopolis... they barely understand music, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_18382013": "I should really... erm, get some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_18383001": "The stars shine in the night sky above.",
  "str_quest_chat_18383002": "The comet crossing the sky becomes a new musical movement...",
  "str_quest_chat_18383003": "Do you hear it, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18383004": "The musical movement?",
  "str_quest_chat_18383005": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_18383006": "Let the music sound within your dreams, reflecting the light of the stars.",
  "str_quest_chat_18383007": "May the music bring you blessings.",
  "str_quest_chat_18401001": "Pardon me, Navigator? I overheard Vice say that the Illuminan officers are aboard Soroz today?",
  "str_quest_chat_18401002": "Which Illuminan officer?",
  "str_quest_chat_18401003": "Ah, so it appears to be true.",
  "str_quest_chat_18401004": "Then that means those Lumopolis ladies should be here, as well?",
  "str_quest_chat_18401005": "Which Lumopolis lady?",
  "str_quest_chat_18401006": "Oh, it appears we have quite a few guests.",
  "str_quest_chat_18401007": "In that case, I think we'll stop here for today!",
  "str_quest_chat_18401008": "What are you even talking about, Genevieve?",
  "str_quest_chat_18401009": "Oh nothing, dear. It occurs to me that I haven't introduced my Anna to you, have I?",
  "str_quest_chat_18401010": "I heard about her a while ago.",
  "str_quest_chat_18401011": "From whom, if I might ask? Was it that person slandering my Anna again?",
  "str_quest_chat_18401012": "I don't think I've seen her.",
  "str_quest_chat_18401013": "Then the time is right for the two of you to meet.",
  "str_quest_chat_18401014": "To me, Anna is not only a horse, she is also the best companion.",
  "str_quest_chat_18401015": "Indeed, Anna and Genevieve, you are a perfect match.",
  "str_quest_chat_18401016": "Hahaha! Thank you for your kind praise, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18401017": "What a pity. There is one thing that I cannot do together with Anna.",
  "str_quest_chat_18401018": "What would that be?",
  "str_quest_chat_18401019": "I can never drink while riding, nor ride after I've been drinking. *Sighing*",
  "str_quest_chat_18401020": "If only there was a way for me to enjoy the taste of gin while also galloping down the road at full speed on Anna's back...",
  "str_quest_chat_18401021": "Seeing the people and scenery on both sides of the road pass by as I ride. I imagine it would be a marvelous sensation...",
  "str_quest_chat_18401022": "Well, at least you're responsible enough to obey the law. That's worthy of praise, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_18441001": "I felt it, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18441002": "Anna and Karenina have felt it, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_18441003": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_18441004": "Your esteem fills me with honor, Navigator. I, Genevieve, will not disappoint you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18441005": "Hahaha, it's not often I get to see Genevieve this serious...",
  "str_quest_chat_18441006": "Now then, back to the subject at hand.",
  "str_quest_chat_18441007": "H-Huh? What subject are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat_18441008": "For the first step of my personal training, I will ask you a question, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18441009": "What question?",
  "str_quest_chat_18441010": "The gin in the bar here on Soroz is abnormally delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat_18441011": "So tell me... Where do you purchase it? And who is in charge of delivering it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18441012": "If you don't mind, you can leave this job to me! I promise to perform my duties marvelously!",
  "str_quest_chat_18441013": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_18441014": "You just want to drink, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18451001": "Good morning, Navigator. What's the plan for today?",
  "str_quest_chat_18451002": "Lie down and get some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_18451003": "That's not good enough. I planned my day out in advance... 236 days ago, in fact.",
  "str_quest_chat_18451004": "What's your plan for today, then?",
  "str_quest_chat_18451005": "Accept my work, complete my work, drink gin, stay with Anna.",
  "str_quest_chat_18451006": "That sounds... exactly like what you already do every day...",
  "str_quest_chat_18452001": "Good morning, Navigator! I have today fully planned out for you, as always!",
  "str_quest_chat_18452002": "Huh? Aren't you up yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_18452003": "Morning... Oh, Genevieve...",
  "str_quest_chat_18452004": "It's you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18452005": "Erm... I already have plans for today.",
  "str_quest_chat_18452006": "Oh? I'm surprised, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18452007": "Well, then—let's have a look at this plan of yours!",
  "str_quest_chat_18452008": "You mean... you actually expect me to write it down?",
  "str_quest_chat_18453001": "Good morning, Mr. Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18453002": "I hope you had a wonderful morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_18453003": "Have you started drinking already?",
  "str_quest_chat_18453004": "Just the one drink, dear Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18453005": "I took on a tough assignment today.",
  "str_quest_chat_18453006": "Getting tipsy before an assignment makes catching the target easier, don't you think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_18453007": "That can't be true...",
  "str_quest_chat_18453008": "Well, I'll be going then.",
  "str_quest_chat_18453009": "Alright. All the best!",
  "str_quest_chat_18461001": "Good afternoon, Navigator. Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_18461002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_18461003": "What will you eat today?",
  "str_quest_chat_18461004": "Yeah, I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_18461005": "What did you eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_18461006": "Just whatever was lying around...",
  "str_quest_chat_18461007": "Oh, now THAT is a real shame! I heard even that person chose a grilled steak for lunch today.",
  "str_quest_chat_18461008": "A grilled steak, huh? Sounds pretty good...",
  "str_quest_chat_18461009": "You need to pay attention to your regular intake of nutritious meals, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18461010": "Thanks for your concern, Genevieve.",
  "str_quest_chat_18461011": "Now then, I'm off to the bar. Farewell.",
  "str_quest_chat_18461012": "Huh? B-But it's still so early!",
  "str_quest_chat_18462001": "What a disappointing afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18462002": "You seem out of sorts, Genevieve.",
  "str_quest_chat_18462003": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_18462004": "Don't you agree that it's only right for one to be entitled to a glass of delicious, strong drink after completing a mission?",
  "str_quest_chat_18462005": "Well, in your case, sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_18462006": "Exactly!",
  "str_quest_chat_18462007": "But I just picked up a bounty from an Umbraton pub, only to discover that they serve terrible drinks!",
  "str_quest_chat_18462008": "I don't know how they can bear living in such a place...",
  "str_quest_chat_18481001": "Barley, rye, grains... Grinding, saccharification, fermentation, distillation, and blending...",
  "str_quest_chat_18481002": "And a container that makes transporting the liquid easy and convenient...",
  "str_quest_chat_18481003": "??",
  "str_quest_chat_18481004": "Ah, what a beautiful night! And how are you feeling tonight, dear Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18481005": "Alright, I suppose. What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_18481006": "Why, concocting my very own gin.",
  "str_quest_chat_18481007": "Drinking too much is bad for your health, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_18481008": "But it's no bad being absolutely trapped by truly fascinating spirits...",
  "str_quest_chat_18481009": "Ahh... Even this robust aroma is enough to make a person drunk!",
  "str_quest_chat_18481010": "Are YOU drunk?",
  "str_quest_chat_18481011": "Not yet... You should get some rest, Navigator. I wish you the most pleasant of dreams tonight!",
  "str_quest_chat_18481012": "Good night, Genevieve.",
  "str_quest_chat_18482001": "Payday is always the happiest day of the week.",
  "str_quest_chat_18482002": "It sounds like you've completed another bounty...",
  "str_quest_chat_18482003": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_18482004": "The only reason bounties are posted is so that they can be completed.",
  "str_quest_chat_18482005": "What an admirable attitude!",
  "str_quest_chat_18482006": "Now you can prepare tomorrow's plan, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18482007": "Let me check...",
  "str_quest_chat_18482008": "My mission book says, \"Get the Navigator to try 30 glasses of my new, specially-prepared mocktails.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_18482009": "Very well. Then I'll wait for you outside your room early tomorrow morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_18482010": "Huh!? I don't think we have to start this, Genevieve!",
  "str_quest_chat_18483001": "Every time I look up at the starry sky, I can't help but want to capture a few stars.",
  "str_quest_chat_18483002": "So Bounty Hunters take stars as their targets too?",
  "str_quest_chat_18483003": "Bounty Hunters' targets don't come exclusively from wanter posters.",
  "str_quest_chat_18483004": "I'm interested in all things that are valuable and powerful.",
  "str_quest_chat_18483005": "What do you see in the stars?",
  "str_quest_chat_18483006": "The stars?",
  "str_quest_chat_18483007": "I'm sure you're aware that beauty is valuable in itself.",
  "str_quest_chat_18483008": "And the stars are beautiful.",
  "str_quest_chat_18484001": "Sorry, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18484002": "I know we're supposed to have dinner together, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_18484003": "I just accept an interesting bounty.",
  "str_quest_chat_18484004": "Oh...",
  "str_quest_chat_18484005": "You want to have that dinner, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18484006": "All right, I'll decline the job.",
  "str_quest_chat_18484007": "It's okay, I'm fine with it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18484008": "You handled that pretty well!",
  "str_quest_chat_18484009": "I'll make it up to you after I'm done!",
  "str_quest_chat_18485001": "What do you think about the dinner?",
  "str_quest_chat_18485002": "Delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat_18485003": "I think I'm a little drunk.",
  "str_quest_chat_18485004": "Huh? But you don't drink all that much.",
  "str_quest_chat_18485005": "I didn't, however...",
  "str_quest_chat_18485006": "I get intoxicated quicker when I'm with someone I like.",
  "str_quest_chat_18485007": "Oh...",
  "str_quest_chat_18485008": "Heh, I can imagine you blushing right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_18485009": "You're really an easy mark!",
  "str_quest_chat_18486001": "The gentle night breeze is making me miss my Anna.",
  "str_quest_chat_18486002": "I don't think Anna is anywhere close to being gentle...",
  "str_quest_chat_18486003": "Anna would boot you if it heard you say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_18486004": "And I would absolutely go flying.",
  "str_quest_chat_18486005": "Not just that, but set you on fire with smoke coming out of your head.",
  "str_quest_chat_18486006": "Don't worry, though, I'll help you back to your feet with my whip.",
  "str_quest_chat_18486007": "Uh, I'd feel a lot better if you don't sic Anna on me in the first place.",
  "str_quest_chat_18487001": "What are you doing, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18487002": "Nothing special.",
  "str_quest_chat_18487003": "Do not squander such a beautiful evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_18487004": "Horseback riding or lassoing, pick one!",
  "str_quest_chat_18487005": "I can't beat you in either.",
  "str_quest_chat_18487006": "That is true.",
  "str_quest_chat_18487007": "Then choose something you're best at...",
  "str_quest_chat_18487008": "Daydreaming.",
  "str_quest_chat_18487009": "You think that's what I do best?",
  "str_quest_chat_18488001": "I just saw you doing that.",
  "str_quest_chat_18488002": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_18488003": "I wanted to say hello, but my fans showed up out of nowhere.",
  "str_quest_chat_18488004": "You sure got suitors.",
  "str_quest_chat_18488005": "A lot of people really like you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18488006": "No way!",
  "str_quest_chat_18488007": "Who do you like among your admirers, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18488008": "What? I should be asking you that.",
  "str_quest_chat_18488009": "Must I say it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18488010": "Well, it's a secret!",
  "str_quest_chat_18501001": "Why would you give me all these? What are you after?",
  "str_quest_chat_18501002": "Just trying to make you happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_18501003": "Happy? You mean, like the feeling I get when Eclipsites howl in pain while I roast them to death?",
  "str_quest_chat_18501004": "No reason, really.",
  "str_quest_chat_18501005": "Aha! Doing whatever you feel like doing, eh? I like it!",
  "str_quest_chat_18501006": "Right, so what do you want me to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_18501007": "Let me guess...",
  "str_quest_chat_18501008": "You're going to make a bonfire for a party tonight, and you need me to help you start the fire?",
  "str_quest_chat_18501009": "Or maybe you're finally fed up with all those Fireflies, and you want me to scorch a few out of the sky?",
  "str_quest_chat_18501010": "Or perhaps... You've finally realized just how terrible your taste is, and look for some much-needed advice from me?",
  "str_quest_chat_18501011": "Ah... You want to paint the Colossus black! And maybe change it to look more like a lion, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_18501012": "Say no more, I totally understand! Just wait for me, I'm on my way!",
  "str_quest_chat_18501013": "Ah!! What?! Wait a minute!!",
  "str_quest_chat_18502001": "Hey, your Fireflies have been acting weird lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_18502002": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_18502003": "Every time they've cleaned my room recently, the Fireflies keep repeating so tired, so tired...",
  "str_quest_chat_18502004": "Huh? Why is that...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18502005": "They're programmed to be obedient.",
  "str_quest_chat_18502006": "Hmph... I've been trying my best to resist the urge to turn them into roasted bug skewers, just for the hell of it!",
  "str_quest_chat_18502007": "Just calm down for now and let me think why this might be happening.",
  "str_quest_chat_18502008": "Have you been feeling particularly hot in your sleep recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_18502009": "Of course I have, but I don't think the Fireflies would get tired just because of the temperature in my room!",
  "str_quest_chat_18502010": "Do you talk to them often?",
  "str_quest_chat_18502011": "If you mean have I been saying stuff like I'll bake you one day or I can't wait to make me some Firefly fricassee, I can't say that I haven't.",
  "str_quest_chat_18502012": "But I don't think words are enough to make them feel so tired!",
  "str_quest_chat_18502013": "The only possibility I can think of is that you've been starting fires while snoring...",
  "str_quest_chat_18502014": "Huh? When I first came here, sure I'd burn my room up a bit, but they handled it no problem. I didn't hear them complain at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_18502015": "Erm... Maybe you've been snoring more frequently than before?",
  "str_quest_chat_18502016": "And that would mean the Fireflies have been extra busy...",
  "str_quest_chat_18502017": "Awesome! That means I'm getting stronger!",
  "str_quest_chat_18502018": "That also means I've been getting some good sleep here on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_18502019": "...Should I be saying thank you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18502020": "Of course! That was a compliment!",
  "str_quest_chat_18502021": "But you should increase the number of Fireflies on duty, especially when it comes to cleaning my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_18502022": "After all, there are only going to be more fires in the future!",
  "str_quest_chat_18502023": "Alright...",
  "str_quest_chat_18541001": "Yo, Navigator! Wanna play with fire? I promise it won't burn you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18541002": "Can't we do it some other time?",
  "str_quest_chat_18541003": "Fine, then can I rumble with this dragon for a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_18541004": "I don't think I've ever fought a dragon before.",
  "str_quest_chat_18541005": "Are you talking about Soroz? If so, then no you can't...",
  "str_quest_chat_18541006": "Then... Are we able to order stuff from Umbraton and have it delivered here?",
  "str_quest_chat_18541007": "Unfortunately, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_18541008": "Ugh... Really?!",
  "str_quest_chat_18541009": "You're telling me the only fun thing to do on this big thing... is hang out with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18541010": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_18542001": "Hey, when are we gonna have a fight here?",
  "str_quest_chat_18542002": "When will you give up this idea of fighting on the Colossus...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18542003": "I'll let you know, but you might be waiting forever.",
  "str_quest_chat_18542004": "I've been in top condition recently, and I'm just itching for a fight!",
  "str_quest_chat_18542005": "I can't contain it... Sparkles were bursting out of my mouth when I brush my teeth!",
  "str_quest_chat_18542006": "Believe me, it's one heck of a feeling!",
  "str_quest_chat_18542007": "Though choking on them isn't all that fun...",
  "str_quest_chat_18542008": "Trust you to get so excited about sparkles flying out of your mouth...",
  "str_quest_chat_18542009": "Don't believe me? Give it a try when you next get the chance!",
  "str_quest_chat_18542010": "Erm... I don't think that'll be necessary...",
  "str_quest_chat_18542011": "So, you like that kind of feeling, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_18542012": "Well, duh! Just imagine how they might burst out of my mouth in an actual battle! It'll be like—Mount Smokey is now active!",
  "str_quest_chat_18542013": "Anyway, I'll show you just how cute those fireballs are next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_18542014": "...Cute? Well, just as long as you don't show me on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_18551001": "Hi, good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_18551002": "Out to play with fire?",
  "str_quest_chat_18551003": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_18551004": "Not up yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_18551005": "I'm up already and you're still asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_18551006": "Can't believe you didn't return my message!",
  "str_quest_chat_18551007": "Just you wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_18551008": "???",
  "str_quest_chat_18551009": "It's only been a minute...",
  "str_quest_chat_18552001": "The sunlight is so annoying!",
  "str_quest_chat_18552002": "It feels good to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_18552003": "It's too bright!",
  "str_quest_chat_18552004": "The light woke me up!",
  "str_quest_chat_18552005": "Nope, I cannot let the sun beat me!",
  "str_quest_chat_18552006": "I want to see who has the brighter fire!",
  "str_quest_chat_18552007": "You'll see, I won't lose!",
  "str_quest_chat_18552008": "Wait, don't set fire inside the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_18553001": "Pitter-patter... Pitter-patter...",
  "str_quest_chat_18553002": "What is that?",
  "str_quest_chat_18553003": "Mimicking the noise of me walking in high heels.",
  "str_quest_chat_18553004": "That sounds loud and clear.",
  "str_quest_chat_18553005": "Yeah, as bright as my fire.",
  "str_quest_chat_18553006": "Fortunately, it's daytime now. It might spook people in the night...",
  "str_quest_chat_18553007": "That sounds painful...",
  "str_quest_chat_18553008": "I wore them simply because I heard it's torture to walk in high heels.",
  "str_quest_chat_18553009": "But it's not agonizing at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_18553010": "You're the only one, you who don't feel pain.",
  "str_quest_chat_18554001": "Off to Umbraton, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18554002": "Now? Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_18554003": "Forget it. Let's go play with sand in Rediesel Wrench.",
  "str_quest_chat_18554004": "That's fine too.",
  "str_quest_chat_18554005": "Nah, that's boring. We go shopping in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_18554006": "So where do you want to go? How about making a plan?",
  "str_quest_chat_18554007": "What do you mean by making a plan?",
  "str_quest_chat_18554008": "Just go wherever you want to go!",
  "str_quest_chat_18554009": "Now that's life!",
  "str_quest_chat_18555001": "Come get your breakfast, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18555002": "I cooked many yummy food myself!",
  "str_quest_chat_18555003": "No way! What did you make?",
  "str_quest_chat_18555004": "Sizzle rack, flaming chocolate, fire-roasted ice cream.",
  "str_quest_chat_18555005": "That sounds great, but I have a bad feeling about it...",
  "str_quest_chat_18555006": "Where did you make it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18555007": "In the kitchen, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_18555008": "Is the kitchen intact?",
  "str_quest_chat_18555009": "Yes, just a bit scorched than before.",
  "str_quest_chat_18556001": "Hey, anything exciting?",
  "str_quest_chat_18556002": "I'm just trying to lead a simple, plain life.",
  "str_quest_chat_18556003": "Then let me add some fire to it!",
  "str_quest_chat_18556004": "That's okay, I like simple and plain.",
  "str_quest_chat_18556005": "There ought to be excitement in life!",
  "str_quest_chat_18556006": "Hey, what's that smell? Is something burning?",
  "str_quest_chat_18556007": "Did you start a fire in the Colossus again?",
  "str_quest_chat_18556008": "Relax, why would I?",
  "str_quest_chat_18556009": "Except for tossing a few fireballs around!",
  "str_quest_chat_18561001": "Hey... I'm hungry.",
  "str_quest_chat_18561002": "Then what would you like to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_18561003": "I'm actually pretty hungry, myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_18561004": "What's there to eat around here?",
  "str_quest_chat_18561005": "There seem to be a lot of small creatures running around. We could trap a few and grill them, maybe add some flavor...",
  "str_quest_chat_18561006": "Yeah! I think I'll start with the Fireflies!",
  "str_quest_chat_18561007": "No, wait! Don't you dare!",
  "str_quest_chat_18561008": "H-Here... You can have my bento...",
  "str_quest_chat_18561009": "Ah, a wise choice, Navigator. In that case, don't mind if I do!",
  "str_quest_chat_18561010": "See you later.",
  "str_quest_chat_18561011": "My lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat_18562001": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_18562002": "It's break time!",
  "str_quest_chat_18562003": "Is it that time already?",
  "str_quest_chat_18562004": "Help me decide what to do—sleep, go shopping, or eat something?",
  "str_quest_chat_18562005": "Erm... I suggest you eat something.",
  "str_quest_chat_18562006": "Then it's decided! I'll go shopping!",
  "str_quest_chat_18562007": "Oh...",
  "str_quest_chat_18563001": "I just had an amazing fight! I'm so pumped!",
  "str_quest_chat_18563002": "... I hope you didn't set anything on fire again!",
  "str_quest_chat_18563003": "Does that include chairs, tables, and bottles?",
  "str_quest_chat_18563004": "Of course it does!",
  "str_quest_chat_18563005": "You're such a stick-in-the-mud... Boring!",
  "str_quest_chat_18563006": "I'm just messing with you—I'm only interested in moving targets.",
  "str_quest_chat_18563007": "How about I treat you to lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_18563008": "Erm... I'd better check how bad the damage on the Colossus is first...",
  "str_quest_chat_18564001": "Hey, it's noon!",
  "str_quest_chat_18564002": "What is there for lunch today?",
  "str_quest_chat_18564003": "I remember seeing barbecue on today's menu.",
  "str_quest_chat_18564004": "It should be waiting for us in the lounge already.",
  "str_quest_chat_18564005": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_18564006": "What's wrong...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18564007": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_18564008": "Wait, don't tell me...",
  "str_quest_chat_18564009": "It got burnt by accident.",
  "str_quest_chat_18564010": "Along with the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat_18564011": "What?!!",
  "str_quest_chat_18565001": "Lunch was gross.",
  "str_quest_chat_18565002": "You mean today's lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_18565003": "No, the lunch I had in this Umbraton restaurant for the past few days was awful.",
  "str_quest_chat_18565004": "It was so bad, what you just made today in comparison tastes actually passable.",
  "str_quest_chat_18565005": "Uh, okay, as long as you don't mind it, I guess...",
  "str_quest_chat_18565006": "Yeah. It would be even better if that stupid blonde wasn't next to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_18565007": "Is that what they call being \"contradictory\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_18565008": "I don't get what you're saying.",
  "str_quest_chat_18566001": "It's noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_18566002": "Yes, it's noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_18566003": "Oh.",
  "str_quest_chat_18566004": "Were you looking for me?",
  "str_quest_chat_18566005": "Nah, not really. I'm just bored.",
  "str_quest_chat_18566006": "I just realized you aren't much fun to talk to.",
  "str_quest_chat_18566007": "I'm off to have some fun on my own. Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_18566008": "Err... Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_18581001": "Can we set off fireworks here? I mean in our rooms, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_18581002": "I-In your room?! Of course not!!",
  "str_quest_chat_18581003": "Oh... Then what about outside our rooms?",
  "str_quest_chat_18581004": "Like in the lounge, or the cafe, or the corridor... What about there?",
  "str_quest_chat_18581005": "Absolutely not!!",
  "str_quest_chat_18581006": "Ugh... How boring.",
  "str_quest_chat_18581007": "Then how about having a midnight showdown with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_18581008": "*Yawn* Oh, would you look at the time? I should really get ready for bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_18581009": "Ugh, so annoying! Fine, good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_18582001": "You're not asleep, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18582002": "I've been learning how to kick out sparks of all different shapes with my boots. Wanna see?",
  "str_quest_chat_18582003": "It's really late... Maybe you should just head to bed instead...",
  "str_quest_chat_18582004": "You're so lazy, and so... boring!",
  "str_quest_chat_18583001": "You need to upgrade the nighttime cooling system.",
  "str_quest_chat_18583002": "Especially in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_18583003": "Is it broken? I'll check it tomorrow...",
  "str_quest_chat_18583004": "It's not broken, I just think it would be fun to start a fire in my room at night, but I'm worried that it might get overheated.",
  "str_quest_chat_18583005": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_18583006": "Don't tell me you've been starting fires in your room!?",
  "str_quest_chat_18583007": "Not yet, but you can bet I'm getting fired up for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18583008": "After you upgrade the cooling system, I'll let the flames rip!",
  "str_quest_chat_18583009": "Erm... Well... you might have to wait for a few years...",
  "str_quest_chat_18584001": "Hey, are you asleep yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_18584002": "I'm not asleep yet, but it's pretty late...",
  "str_quest_chat_18584003": "So? I'm still awake!",
  "str_quest_chat_18584004": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_18584005": "I had a cup of coffee, and now I'm totally wired.",
  "str_quest_chat_18584006": "Well... maybe you can... do something that'll help you get to sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_18584007": "Help me get to sleep, eh? Well, that makes sense.",
  "str_quest_chat_18584008": "Where are you right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_18584009": "Erm... Why do you want to know?",
  "str_quest_chat_18584010": "I want to hold a fire party on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_18584011": "No! Just... No!",
  "str_quest_chat_18585001": "Hey, I can't fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_18585002": "I'm still up too.",
  "str_quest_chat_18585003": "What do you do when you have insomnia?",
  "str_quest_chat_18585004": "Oh, my mind just wanders...",
  "str_quest_chat_18585005": "What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18585006": "I want to go shopping.",
  "str_quest_chat_18585007": "Wish someone would make an outfit out of fire.",
  "str_quest_chat_18585008": "Awesome!",
  "str_quest_chat_18585009": "Tessa would love it too.",
  "str_quest_chat_18585010": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_18585011": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_18585012": "Asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_18585013": "... Humph, kids doze off so easily.",
  "str_quest_chat_18585014": "Whatever. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_18586001": "It's late.",
  "str_quest_chat_18586002": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_18586003": "Lying on the bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_18586004": "I was going to do some reading.",
  "str_quest_chat_18586005": "Oh.",
  "str_quest_chat_18586006": "Well, just thought I'll ask.",
  "str_quest_chat_18586007": "Night then.",
  "str_quest_chat_18586008": "Err... Night.",
  "str_quest_chat_18601001": "My relationship with the Illumina Federation is kinda like... a hammer's relationship with a nail.",
  "str_quest_chat_18601002": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_18601003": "Aren't you a technician for the Rediesel Wrench?",
  "str_quest_chat_18601004": "When I was in Illumina, I felt I was like a brand-new oil drum that had been knocked over and completely emptied.",
  "str_quest_chat_18601005": "My love-hate relationship with it is... complicated.",
  "str_quest_chat_18601006": "Like a hammer and nail, and... an oil drum? Well, it does sound pretty complicated. What exactly is your relation to them?",
  "str_quest_chat_18601007": "To be honest... I really don't have one, but for some reason, I felt like saying that to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18601008": "I feel really calm here.",
  "str_quest_chat_18601009": "And whenever I'm too busy to help with other people's issues, I can use you as an excuse to turn them down!",
  "str_quest_chat_18601010": "And how's that working for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18601011": "It works great! Your name carries some weight around here, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18601012": "So, think I can stay here a little longer to keep people from seeing through my excuses?",
  "str_quest_chat_18601013": "Of course you can!",
  "str_quest_chat_18601014": "Awesome!",
  "str_quest_chat_18602001": "PlayerName, are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_18602002": "Vice asked me to come help with the Colossus. There was also something else I wanted to discuss with you...",
  "str_quest_chat_18602003": "I'll be waiting for you on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_18602004": "Okay, I'll be right there.",
  "str_quest_chat_18641001": "Hello, Navigator! My name is Fleur!",
  "str_quest_chat_18641002": "If you ever need anything fixed, just call on me and I'll be glad to help!",
  "str_quest_chat_18641003": "Hello, Fleur. Welcome aboard Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_18641004": "Now then, can I start my research on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_18641005": "If you couldn't tell, I'm barely able to contain my excitement right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_18641006": "You're free to do so, but just be careful not to put the Colossus in any danger!",
  "str_quest_chat_18641007": "Relax, I'll be really careful! Just ask Allen, I'm as careful as they come!",
  "str_quest_chat_18641008": "Allen?",
  "str_quest_chat_18641009": "My toolbox!",
  "str_quest_chat_18641010": "How should I put it? Allen is... like a second me!",
  "str_quest_chat_18641011": "He is totally crazy about machines, indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_18642001": "Thank you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18642002": "I feel I'm becoming more and more proficient at controlling machinery, thanks to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18642003": "I'm full of confidence, and Allen is bursting with energy!",
  "str_quest_chat_18642004": "Ah, and also, I've been getting better at drawing up mechanical blueprints!",
  "str_quest_chat_18642005": "And it's all because of you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18642006": "Actually, I haven't...",
  "str_quest_chat_18642007": "This is all the result of your own hard work.",
  "str_quest_chat_18642008": "Don't be so polite. You brought me one step closer to finding that first step I needed to start pursuing my dream.",
  "str_quest_chat_18642009": "Remembering how I repaired Lepidoz before...",
  "str_quest_chat_18642010": "I disassembled Lepidoz's shell to study its internal structure.",
  "str_quest_chat_18642011": "And then I got Lepidoz back into peak condition!",
  "str_quest_chat_18642012": "So now, I have a really tiny request to ask of you...",
  "str_quest_chat_18642013": "There's no need to stand on ceremony with me... We're all friends here.",
  "str_quest_chat_18642014": "Heh, well actually...",
  "str_quest_chat_18642015": "After the Colossus lands, can I take Soroz's outer shell apart and have a look inside?",
  "str_quest_chat_18642016": "Of course you can't!",
  "str_quest_chat_18661001": "Hey Navigator, have you eaten?",
  "str_quest_chat_18661002": "Eh, it doesn't really matter. I'm just as interested in researching Caelestites as I am in working with machines!",
  "str_quest_chat_18661003": "R-Research... me? What exactly are you planning to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_18661004": "Hahaha, don't be so nervous! The thought hit me just now, as I was eating my lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_18661005": "You see, I have a tail, too. Same as Vice!",
  "str_quest_chat_18661006": "But your tail is different from Vice's.",
  "str_quest_chat_18661007": "So... What's your point?",
  "str_quest_chat_18661008": "Soroz has a tail, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_18661009": "???",
  "str_quest_chat_18661010": "What I'm saying, is we have more in common with machines than we think!",
  "str_quest_chat_18661011": "I-I guess that's an idea worth thinking about...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18662001": "Navigator, something very sad happened to me today.",
  "str_quest_chat_18662002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_18662003": "A screw on my wrench dropped off all of a sudden...",
  "str_quest_chat_18662004": "My precious, perfect, amazing little screw...",
  "str_quest_chat_18662005": "I feel so sad...",
  "str_quest_chat_18662006": "But... surely you have a bunch of spare screws in your toolbox.",
  "str_quest_chat_18662007": "That's right! But the whole ordeal has forced me to reflect on... well... everything.",
  "str_quest_chat_18662008": "Reflect?",
  "str_quest_chat_18662009": "Screws should be checked and adjusted on time.",
  "str_quest_chat_18662010": "Otherwise, they'll abandon you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18662011": "...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18662012": "So, I also need to eat on time, or my guts will abandon me!",
  "str_quest_chat_18662013": "Navigator, you should go grab some lunch, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_18662014": "If you hadn't started talking to me, I'd be eating right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_18663001": "Mind going with me to the party in the desert tonight?",
  "str_quest_chat_18663002": "Hmm? Why do you pick me?",
  "str_quest_chat_18663003": "It should be easier for you to invite a girl.",
  "str_quest_chat_18663004": "Umm... It's problematic trying to get along with girls.",
  "str_quest_chat_18663005": "I don't get them, and they always get mad or happy for unknown reasons.",
  "str_quest_chat_18663006": "I feel better hanging out with guys.",
  "str_quest_chat_18663007": "That's true.",
  "str_quest_chat_18663008": "If I could be like you, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18663009": "Who got along naturally whether it was a guy or a girl.",
  "str_quest_chat_18663010": "Well, I'm pretty charming, aren't I?",
  "str_quest_chat_18664001": "If only I came to the Colossus sooner.",
  "str_quest_chat_18664002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_18664003": "There're a lot of books on repair here.",
  "str_quest_chat_18664004": "Feel free to browse them anytime.",
  "str_quest_chat_18664005": "I've been doing that for two days.",
  "str_quest_chat_18664006": "I even embarrassed myself yesterday afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_18664007": "I clearly remembered starting on a book at 3 in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_18664008": "But when I finished it, it was 2 in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_18664009": "I thought there was a problem with the clock.",
  "str_quest_chat_18664010": "Until I looked at the date and realized it was a day later.",
  "str_quest_chat_18664011": "Ha... You should take a break next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_18665001": "I have a question for you, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18665002": "Shoot.",
  "str_quest_chat_18665003": "What is the most common cause for girls to blush?",
  "str_quest_chat_18665004": "Shyness?",
  "str_quest_chat_18665005": "Anger?",
  "str_quest_chat_18665006": "Oh, I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_18665007": "I'm just guessing and might not be right.",
  "str_quest_chat_18665008": "Girls are complicated.",
  "str_quest_chat_18665009": "But your answer is very intriguing.",
  "str_quest_chat_18665010": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_18665011": "They said when you talk to girls, you'd sometimes blush, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_18665012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_18666001": "The corridor light is out, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_18666002": "Okay, I'll fix it later.",
  "str_quest_chat_18666003": "Can I do it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18666004": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_18666005": "Can I fix it?",
  "str_quest_chat_18666006": "Sure, if it's not too much trouble for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18666007": "Wonderful!",
  "str_quest_chat_18666008": "I get to work on the internal mechanisms of the Colossus up close!",
  "str_quest_chat_18666009": "It's only a light...",
  "str_quest_chat_18667001": "Ah...",
  "str_quest_chat_18667002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_18667003": "There's a car race at Rediesel Wrench tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_18667004": "Are you in?",
  "str_quest_chat_18667005": "I signed up long ago, even spent time boosting my car.",
  "str_quest_chat_18667006": "Only for them to disqualify me just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_18667007": "Why did they do that?",
  "str_quest_chat_18667008": "Supposedly somebody saw my picture on the poster and took it for themself.",
  "str_quest_chat_18667009": "And since the posters were hard to come by, some fans even fought over them.",
  "str_quest_chat_18667010": "For safety considerations, they kicked me out of the race.",
  "str_quest_chat_18667011": "A problem for the good-looking, I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_18668001": "This is rough...",
  "str_quest_chat_18668002": "I just made a girl cry without knowing why.",
  "str_quest_chat_18668003": "No way, you made a girl cry?",
  "str_quest_chat_18668004": "But I didn't do anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_18668005": "She said I'm too popular and will certainly play with her emotions.",
  "str_quest_chat_18668006": "No matter how I explained, she wouldn't believe it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18668007": "That's probably a misconception all girls have when they first met you.",
  "str_quest_chat_18668008": "If they get to know you a little better, they'll know you are...",
  "str_quest_chat_18668009": "Really a dullard who knew nothing beyond repairing things...",
  "str_quest_chat_18681001": "Gears, meshing, clockwork...",
  "str_quest_chat_18681002": "What are you doing, Fleur?",
  "str_quest_chat_18681003": "Hey, Navigator! I'm just sharing my precious sleeping trick with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18681004": "And what are those?",
  "str_quest_chat_18681005": "These are all words that describe machinery and how it works. They sound so beautiful when you put them together, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_18681006": "Whenever I have trouble sleeping, I'll say them in my head and imagine the way they look in action.",
  "str_quest_chat_18681007": "So I want to share that with you. Hopefully, imagining the beauty of machinery will give you the same sweet dreams as it does for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_18681008": "What a... unique way of dealing with insomnia. Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18682001": "The silence of the night fascinates me.",
  "str_quest_chat_18682002": "It frees you from the stresses of work and allows you to relish the bliss of solitude.",
  "str_quest_chat_18682003": "Ah... The smell of machinery embraces me...",
  "str_quest_chat_18682004": "Did you come up with that yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_18682005": "Huh? Navigator? Do you need me for something?",
  "str_quest_chat_18682006": "Oh, I think I accidentally sent you those messages...",
  "str_quest_chat_18682007": "Haha! Do you like what I wrote?",
  "str_quest_chat_18682008": "Goodnight, Fleur...",
  "str_quest_chat_18683001": "You are not asleep yet, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_18683002": "Are you asleep...? Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_18683003": "Can't you hear me snoring?",
  "str_quest_chat_18683004": "Snoring while typing... Hmm, is this some new Caelestite ability?",
  "str_quest_chat_18683005": "Not quite, but I'm ready to go to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_18683006": "Wake yourself up then, I had the sudden urge to investigate biology from a mechanical point of view.",
  "str_quest_chat_18683007": "That's a good idea, but I'm so sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_18683008": "Well, I can leave this 434,079 words paper containing my ruminations on the relationship between machinery and biology for you to read tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_18683009": "Remember to share your thoughts with me after reading it, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18683010": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_18684001": "Glamorous evening. Would thee like to spend this wond'rful evening with yours truly?",
  "str_quest_chat_18684002": "Who are you supposed to be?",
  "str_quest_chat_18684003": "I am Fleur, the mast'r of machin'ry.",
  "str_quest_chat_18684004": "I'm not really in the mood...",
  "str_quest_chat_18684005": "How could thee turn down an invitation from a mechanical mast'r?!",
  "str_quest_chat_18684006": "What happened to you, Fleur?",
  "str_quest_chat_18684007": "Haven't you touch your toolbox all day...",
  "str_quest_chat_18684008": "Well, I read a book that had nothing to do with machinery for the first time today.",
  "str_quest_chat_18684009": "That's how the characters in the book talk. I thought I'd try it out.",
  "str_quest_chat_18684010": "I really think you should stick to your books on mechanical topics instead.",
  "str_quest_chat_18685001": "Navigator, is tonight's dinner okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_18685002": "Sure... why?",
  "str_quest_chat_18685003": "Oh... Good...",
  "str_quest_chat_18685004": "I was helping out in the kitchen, and I dropped a screw in the pot...",
  "str_quest_chat_18685005": "I couldn't find it no matter how hard I looked, so I thought it probably ended up on someone's plate.",
  "str_quest_chat_18685006": "I'm asking everyone right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_18685007": "Ugh... That's terrible.",
  "str_quest_chat_18685008": "The worst thing is that... it's a special screw from Illumina. It's very rare!",
  "str_quest_chat_18685009": "That's not the point! Go find it, now!",
  "str_quest_chat_18686001": "Navigator, how's the Colossus' stability?",
  "str_quest_chat_18686002": "It's stable. No problem!",
  "str_quest_chat_18686003": "Though it feels a bit bumpy at times...",
  "str_quest_chat_18686004": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_18686005": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_18686006": "I'm thinking... If we attach a sail on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_18686007": "We could use the wind to aid us on long journeys and reduce energy costs.",
  "str_quest_chat_18686008": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_18701001": "D-Do you like little donkeys, Navigator...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18701002": "That's... kind of an odd question.",
  "str_quest_chat_18701003": "I-I'm sorry! P-Please let me explain...",
  "str_quest_chat_18701004": "Y-You see... My paper pieces made a shape one day, and I thought it looked like a little donkey...",
  "str_quest_chat_18701005": "Also, the donkey had a horn...",
  "str_quest_chat_18701006": "Why would a little donkey have a horn?",
  "str_quest_chat_18701007": "Ah, um...",
  "str_quest_chat_18701008": "I-I think maybe it's where it keeps its soul...",
  "str_quest_chat_18701009": "I see. That's very much like you to say that, Pasolo.",
  "str_quest_chat_18701010": "S-So... You think the soul is special too, right? Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_18701011": "Yes, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_18701012": "I'm not.",
  "str_quest_chat_18701013": "I really wish I knew what your soul looks like, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18701014": "Well now that you say it, I'm a little curious about it, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_18701015": "R-Really...? Then n-next time, I'll let you see it with your own eyes, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18701016": "No problem.",
  "str_quest_chat_18761001": "G-Good afternoon, N-Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18761002": "I-I hope I'm n-not interrupting anything... S-Sorry if I am...",
  "str_quest_chat_18761003": "Good afternoon, Pasolo.",
  "str_quest_chat_18761004": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_18761005": "N-Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_18761006": "A-Actually, I came here to remind you to eat lunch, N-Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18761007": "I-If someone else already reminded you, j-j-just forget I said anything...",
  "str_quest_chat_18761008": "Thanks for reminding me. You remember to eat regularly too, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_18761009": "I... I'll do my best to eat, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_18761010": "Y-You really don't need to try so hard! It's just food...",
  "str_quest_chat_18762001": "N-Navigator... Would you like to have lunch with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_18762002": "Sure. What do you feel like eating?",
  "str_quest_chat_18762003": "I've got it all ready for you... It's gonna be a feast!",
  "str_quest_chat_18762004": "Rediesel wormsteak from the Rediesel Wrench, Lullapup from Umbraton, shark meat stew from Northland...",
  "str_quest_chat_18762005": "I didn't know you were such a talented cook.",
  "str_quest_chat_18762006": "Hmm... I think it's more a case of being good at controlling paper...",
  "str_quest_chat_18762007": "What does cooking have to do with paper?",
  "str_quest_chat_18762008": "Wait... You didn't make all of those dishes out of paper, did you!?",
  "str_quest_chat_18763001": "G-Good afternoon, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763002": "Good afternoon, Pasolo.",
  "str_quest_chat_18763003": "Had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_18763004": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763005": "A Rediesel Wrench member that I don't know made the lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_18763006": "Was it Roy?",
  "str_quest_chat_18763007": "He was dressed in red...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763008": "And he was really nice...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763009": "Then that's him for sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_18763010": "Could it be... the legendary Uncle Johnny!",
  "str_quest_chat_18763011": "Who's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_18763012": "I was just joking...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763013": "A Rediesel Wrench member that can cook...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763014": "That's most likely Roy.",
  "str_quest_chat_18763015": "The ingredients that man used were very strange. There were a lot of bugs I had never seen before, and lizards...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763016": "Rediesel Wrench cuisine...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763017": "How should I put it... they're very visually... stimulating.",
  "str_quest_chat_18763018": "Yes... I was really shocked...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763019": "But the weird-looking food actually tasted surprisingly good...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763020": "I... I liked it...",
  "str_quest_chat_18763021": "I'm glad you liked it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18763022": "But try not to eat too much at a time.",
  "str_quest_chat_18763023": "Or you won't be able to handle it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18763024": "Yes, I'll keep that in mind...",
  "str_quest_chat_18764001": "Na-Navigator, good afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_18764002": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_18764003": "I think your lunch box looks really good...",
  "str_quest_chat_18764004": "I rarely eat such a well-balanced lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat_18764005": "Well, yeah! It's totally non-fattening!",
  "str_quest_chat_18764006": "You've got to eat more to grow up healthy.",
  "str_quest_chat_18764007": "Alright! W-well, then Navigator should eat more as well and stay full.",
  "str_quest_chat_18764008": "Sure thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_18765001": "Hello, Navigator. Miss Vice asked me to tell you something.",
  "str_quest_chat_18765002": "What is it, Pasolo?",
  "str_quest_chat_18765003": "Pasolo?",
  "str_quest_chat_18765004": "S-Sorry! I accidentally fell asleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_18765005": "Don't worry about it, Pasolo. It happens to the best of us.",

  "str_quest_chat_18765009": "Hahaha! No, you're perfectly fine!",
  "str_quest_chat_18765010": "Besides, I'm sure Vice will forgive me... I think...",

  "str_quest_chat_18767007": "I'm sorry, Navigator... You're a nice person, and I shouldn't be complaining to you like this.",
  "str_quest_chat_18767008": "Don't say that, Pasolo! I like talking to you!",

  "str_quest_chat_18851008": "Ah, was it my imagination... or did you say but just now?",
  "str_quest_chat_18851009": "What were you going to say after that but?",
  "str_quest_chat_18851010": "Jola... I've actually eaten breakfast, already...",
  "str_quest_chat_18851011": "I'm not very hungry right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_18851012": "I see... So, that's how it is? You're the kind of person who likes to let people down?",

  "str_quest_chat_18851014": "I can eat! I can eat!",

  "str_quest_chat_18852006": "I can see how much you value your friends, and how you wish to protect your friendships...",

  "str_quest_chat_18853006": "This isn't work. This is love in action.",
  "str_quest_chat_18853007": "Don't underestimate these small and delicate flowers.",
  "str_quest_chat_18853008": "For they're as strong as love itself.",

  "str_quest_chat_18854007": "That's quite alright...",
  "str_quest_chat_18854008": "Good morning, Jola!",
  "str_quest_chat_18854009": "Oh? Awake and full of life, like a blooming flower in its prime! How refreshing!",
  "str_quest_chat_18854010": "But the more vibrant the flower, the more it needs to be watered with love...",
  "str_quest_chat_18854011": "Today, I shall tend to you with the utmost care and attention, and trim your leaves most tenderly!",
  "str_quest_chat_18854012": "Hahaha, thanks but no thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_18855001": "Sigh, yet another flower escaped from my garden. What a pity...",
  "str_quest_chat_18855002": "By the time I found her, the worst had already come to pass!",
  "str_quest_chat_18855003": "The foul soil of the outside world had already tainted her, and disgusting pests were crawling up and down her beautiful stem...",
  "str_quest_chat_18855004": "I had no choice but to take my scissors and snip that gorgeous little head of hers...",
  "str_quest_chat_18855005": "Tell me, why must flowers be so insatiably curious?",
  "str_quest_chat_18855006": "Why do they forsake my garden in favor of the outside world's embrace?",
  "str_quest_chat_18855007": "I, uh... don't really know much about flowers...",
  "str_quest_chat_18855008": "Maybe it's just in their nature?",
  "str_quest_chat_18855009": "Their \"nature\"...? Could my love truly lose to something such as this?",
  "str_quest_chat_18855010": "I understand now! This means I must redouble my loving efforts until I overcome this absurd \"nature\" of theirs!",
  "str_quest_chat_18855011": "G-Good luck... Just don't get too carried away!",
  "str_quest_chat_18856001": "My dear PlayerName, my sleep was visited by a nightmare last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_18856002": "I dreamt that my most beloved flower left me with nary a hint of hesitation...",
  "str_quest_chat_18856003": "My chest feels as though it has been pierced by a thousand thorns...",
  "str_quest_chat_18856004": "Do you have a moment to hear my pain, that this accursed pain might finally leave me?",
  "str_quest_chat_18856005": "Your \"most beloved flower\"... You mean your little sister?",
  "str_quest_chat_18856006": "Indeed! You know me so well, my friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_18856007": "I also know what it feels like to be separated from your family.",
  "str_quest_chat_18856008": "But I believe that as long as both of you are alive in this world,",
  "str_quest_chat_18856009": "you'll see each other again someday!",
  "str_quest_chat_18856010": "You truly believe that my beloved flower will follow the scent of my love and return to me once again?",
  "str_quest_chat_18856011": "Ah... I'm delighted to know that you have such strong faith in my love!",
  "str_quest_chat_18856012": "If only that girl was more like you... No!",
  "str_quest_chat_18856013": "Since you have placed so much trust in my love, I should do the same! I must wait patiently for her return!",
  "str_quest_chat_18856014": "Well... I can't say I really understand...",
  "str_quest_chat_18856015": "But that's okay! I'm just glad you figured something out!",
  "str_quest_chat_18857001": "Good morning! I've come to deliver you the first fine fragrance of the morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_18857002": "As the light of morn shines on the windowsill, the flowers start to sing! ♪",
  "str_quest_chat_18857003": "Rosemary, my dear, and Sweet William too, let us join hands and form a ring! ♪",
  "str_quest_chat_18857004": "For soon, we shall see what this lovely new day brings! ♪",
  "str_quest_chat_18857005": "Ah! You know, if my flowers weren't in dire need of my tender, loving care, I would love to spend the day singing songs for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18857006": "Th-That won't be necessary!",
  "str_quest_chat_18857007": "But thanks for the wake-up call, and good morning to you, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_18857008": "I'm wide awake now!",
  "str_quest_chat_18857009": "That's wonderful to hear! I wish you a pleasant day, my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_18857010": "And never forget, my love will always surround you!",
  "str_quest_chat_18858001": "Oh, my precious little flower! Why must you go so far away?",
  "str_quest_chat_18858002": "Is it simply the nature of dandelions to wander as they please?",
  "str_quest_chat_18858003": "Huh? What are you talking about, Jola?",
  "str_quest_chat_18858004": "I'm talking about my precious little flower, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_18858005": "Did another one of them escape from your garden?",
  "str_quest_chat_18858006": "Not quite... My precious little flower is an avid traveler, you see.",
  "str_quest_chat_18858007": "He has never been content to live in my garden and receive my love and affection.",
  "str_quest_chat_18858008": "He loves to roam from place to place, only to return to my side with renewed love...",
  "str_quest_chat_18858009": "I can't say I dislike such a refreshing feeling, but parting ways is always so unbearably painful.",
  "str_quest_chat_18858010": "Uh-huh, I knew it! I have no idea what you're talking about!",
  "str_quest_chat_18858011": "If you really don't want your flowers to leave...",
  "str_quest_chat_18858012": "Why don't you just tighten up your garden's fences?",
  "str_quest_chat_18858013": "Are you saying my love should be even more constricting than before...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18858014": "Yes, that makes perfect sense! A pleasure that can seldom be described with words!",
  "str_quest_chat_18858015": "That's precisely what I'll do, my friend! And just you wait, for when I return, my love will envelop you all the more passionately!",
  "str_quest_chat_18858016": "Wait a minute... Something's not right about this...",
  "str_quest_chat_18858017": "Hang on, Jola! I think you might have misunderstood me! Jola!!",
  "str_quest_chat_18951001": "It's morning! It's morning! Wake up!",
  "str_quest_chat_18951002": "Coocoo, Coocoo, coo!",
  "str_quest_chat_18951003": "Is that Eho? Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_18951004": "Erm... Why are you cooing like a pigeon?",
  "str_quest_chat_18951005": "I wanted to make you think you'd been woken up by a naughty pigeon, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_18952001": "Urgh, my head...",
  "str_quest_chat_18952002": "What's the matter, Eho?",
  "str_quest_chat_18952003": "I had a little too much fun last night. Yoshi ended up dragging me home afterward...",
  "str_quest_chat_18952004": "My head's killing me... Get me a glass of water, would you Yoshi?",
  "str_quest_chat_18952005": "Wait! What am I doing, wasting time chatting on the terminal with you?!",
  "str_quest_chat_18952006": "Yoshi's just by my side!",
  "str_quest_chat_18952007": "We're gonna be late for work, now let's go! Bye-bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_18952008": "Are you really in any condition to go to work, Eho...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18953001": "It's morning! It's morning! Wake up!",
  "str_quest_chat_18953002": "Eho! You're being way too loud!",
  "str_quest_chat_18953003": "My ears are ringing!",
  "str_quest_chat_18953004": "Alright, that concludes today's Wake-up Call Service!",
  "str_quest_chat_18953005": "\"Wake-up Call Service\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_18953006": "Vice hasn't been thrilled about you sleeping in lately, so she hired me to provide you with \"Eho's Amazing Wake-up Call Service\"!",
  "str_quest_chat_18953007": "Is this really something that you offer...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18953008": "For the right price, sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_18953009": "Speaking of, now that my services have been provided, it's time to collect my payment!",
  "str_quest_chat_18953010": "See ya!",
  "str_quest_chat_18953011": "Bye, Eho... You do keep yourself busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_18954001": "Listen up!",
  "str_quest_chat_18954002": "Some of our clients have been asking the Courier Union to dismiss me on account of my \"unpleasant voice\"!",
  "str_quest_chat_18954003": "They're calling it a \"disruption of the peace\"! Can you believe that? Where's this even coming from?!",
  "str_quest_chat_18954004": "You don't think my voice is \"unpleasant,\" do you?!",
  "str_quest_chat_18954005": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_18954006": "I think your voice is perfectly fine, Eho.",
  "str_quest_chat_18954007": "But that's probably because I'm used to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_18954008": "Whaddya mean, \"used to it\"?! That doesn't make me feel better at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_18954009": "Well... Maybe just a little...",
  "str_quest_chat_18954010": "But I don't think it's bad enough to file a formal complaint, though!",
  "str_quest_chat_18954011": "Tch, I knew it! Everyone thinks I sound obnoxious!",
  "str_quest_chat_18954012": "Either way, I don't think the Courier Union should fire you over this!",
  "str_quest_chat_18954013": "That would be crossing the line!",
  "str_quest_chat_18954014": "Don't worry, I'm used to this sort of thing...",
  "str_quest_chat_18954015": "Besides, the Courier Union would never fire me because of my voice.",
  "str_quest_chat_18954016": "Sigh, poor Eho...",
  "str_quest_chat_18955001": "Morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_18955002": "Morning, Eho!",
  "str_quest_chat_18955003": "I'm surprised you have time to say hi to me today!",
  "str_quest_chat_18955004": "You better think of something more interesting to say...",
  "str_quest_chat_18955005": "I'm starting to fall asleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_18955006": "You didn't stay up all night, did you Eho...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18955007": "Of course I did! Who has time to sleep when you're working three jobs?!",
  "str_quest_chat_18955008": "Don't you think that's a little unhealthy...?",
  "str_quest_chat_18955009": "The poor can't afford to look after their own health, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_18955010": "So whatever you do, don't end up broke! Otherwise, all those all-nighters will wreak havoc on your cute looks...",
  "str_quest_chat_18955011": "... That was Yoshi typing just now, now me! Anyways, it's time for me to go to work!",
  "str_quest_chat_18955012": "Heheh, sure. Just remember to take care of yourself, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_18956001": "PlayerName!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_18956002": "We're in trouble! Big trouble! I've been losing it ever since I woke up this morning!",

  "str_quest_chat_18956004": "D-Did something bad happen without me realizing it?!",
  "str_quest_chat_18956005": "W-W-We need to get airborne right away! Soroz!",
  "str_quest_chat_18956006": "... That won't be necessary.",

  "str_quest_chat_18956009": "They were all supposed to be delivered yesterday... Gallo's gonna have my head for this!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_18956010": "Sorry to hear, Eho... Hang in there...",
  "str_quest_chat_18961001": "It's noontime! Gah!",
  "str_quest_chat_18961002": "Good afternoon, Eho!",
  "str_quest_chat_18961003": "Let me tell you a joke!",
  "str_quest_chat_18961004": "A Northlander, an Umbratonian, and an Illuminan walk into a bar...",

  "str_quest_chat_18962002": "Fat Ration?",
  "str_quest_chat_18962003": "Have one and you'll feel full in no time! From Illumina!",
  "str_quest_chat_18962004": "You mean Fast Ration...",
  "str_quest_chat_18962005": "Right! That's it! Dove gave me some the last time!",
  "str_quest_chat_18962006": "There are still some on the Colossus. Vice brought them.",
  "str_quest_chat_18962007": "It doesn't taste like much...",
  "str_quest_chat_18962008": "Keeping the stomach full is all that matters! There's too much work to be done!",
  "str_quest_chat_18962009": "I have no time to eat!",

  "str_quest_chat_18962011": "Have the fireflies send it to my room later. Gotta run!",

  "str_quest_chat_18963001": "I'm starving! PlayerName, have you got anything filling but quick to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_18963002": "Ideally, something that'll keep me full all day on a single mouthful!",
  "str_quest_chat_18963003": "There's no such thing!",
  "str_quest_chat_18963004": "Wait, you mean you haven't eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_18963005": "I don't have time! I'm delivering letters.",

  "str_quest_chat_19051004": "Huh? What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_19051005": "Heartbreaking? Are we talking about cats, here?",
  "str_quest_chat_19051006": "You bet it is!",
  "str_quest_chat_19051007": "My kitten's sleeping. I don't want to disturb it, but I really want to touch it...",
  "str_quest_chat_19051008": "Erm... If this kind of thing breaks your heart...",
  "str_quest_chat_19051009": "Why don't you just find something else to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_19051010": "Hey now! That's a good idea!",

  "str_quest_chat_19052001": "Hey man. You seen a cat around here?",
  "str_quest_chat_19052002": "It's my cat. It ran out this morning and I've no idea where it might be hiding.",
  "str_quest_chat_19052003": "Well, have you tried its usual hiding places?",
  "str_quest_chat_19052004": "I have!",
  "str_quest_chat_19052005": "The cafe, lounge, bar, corridor...",
  "str_quest_chat_19052006": "And he's nowhere to be found!",
  "str_quest_chat_19052007": "I'll ask around for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_19052008": "And get everyone on the Colossus to keep an eye out!",

  "str_quest_chat_19052010": "Please tell everyone to not feed him too much milk or snacks!",
  "str_quest_chat_19052011": "He has a habit of acting cute to beg for food.",
  "str_quest_chat_19052012": "He'll get chubby otherwise!",
  "str_quest_chat_19052013": "Sure, don't worry.",
  "str_quest_chat_19052014": "I'll let everyone know!",
  "str_quest_chat_19052015": "I'm counting on you!",
  "str_quest_chat_19061001": "Hey, have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_19061002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_19061003": "Huh? Why haven't you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_19061004": "I—",
  "str_quest_chat_19061005": "You can have mine, if you want!",
  "str_quest_chat_19061006": "Look how healthy it is! Vegetable soup and gluten-free bread!",
  "str_quest_chat_19061007": "But it might taste a tiny bit strange... My cat was lapping at it a little. You don't mind, do you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19061008": "I'm good, thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_19061009": "I'm going to eat now... thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_19062001": "Have you noticed the injuries on my arm?",
  "str_quest_chat_19062002": "Hm, no I haven't.",
  "str_quest_chat_19062003": "Bro, why don't you pay attention to me at all?",
  "str_quest_chat_19062004": "You have a lot of injuries, indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_19062005": "But they're from the cats, aren't they?",
  "str_quest_chat_19062006": "Whoa, you know me so well!",
  "str_quest_chat_19062007": "That's right. The cats showered me with their affection.",
  "str_quest_chat_19062008": "Now where have they gone to?",
  "str_quest_chat_19062009": "Without them, I can only reminisce by looking at these scars...",
  "str_quest_chat_19062010": "You're quite passionate, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19062011": "You may even be going a little bonkers!",
  "str_quest_chat_19063001": "You won't believe it, bro! The kitten's sleeping on my leg right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_19063002": "Awww, just look at it snoozing with its belly up! It's even snoring a little...",
  "str_quest_chat_19063003": "Man, I wish you could see how cute this little fella is!",
  "str_quest_chat_19063004": "Whoa, it rolled over just now! I think typing on the terminal might've disturbed it a little...",
  "str_quest_chat_19063005": "I need to be careful not to wake up my little buddy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19063006": "See you later, bro!",
  "str_quest_chat_19063007": "Sorry, I just read your message!",
  "str_quest_chat_19063008": "A cute little kitten sleeping on Korgon's leg...",
  "str_quest_chat_19063009": "Now there's a sight I'd like to see!",
  "str_quest_chat_19064001": "Hey, lemme ask you something, bro. Do I really look that scary to you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19064002": "A little, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_19064003": "There aren't many Aurorians who look like you, Korgon.",
  "str_quest_chat_19064004": "Some people just need a little more time to adjust...",
  "str_quest_chat_19064005": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_19064006": "There are plenty of people that are way scarier than you, Korgon!",
  "str_quest_chat_19064007": "Besides, you're actually a really nice guy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19064008": "So that's how you feel, huh bro...",
  "str_quest_chat_19064009": "Why did you ask me that all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_19064010": "Actually... I saw a bunch of kids staring at me on the street today.",
  "str_quest_chat_19064011": "I wanted to be polite, so I flashed them my signature smile and said hello!",
  "str_quest_chat_19064012": "But they all ran off screaming...",
  "str_quest_chat_19064013": "Korgon's \"signature smile\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_19064014": "That might be a little too much for people who don't really know you!",
  "str_quest_chat_19064015": "Ugh, everyone says that a smile is the perfect expression of peace.",
  "str_quest_chat_19064016": "So why can't I get it right...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19065001": "Hey, bro! You like eating fish?",
  "str_quest_chat_19065002": "I do!",
  "str_quest_chat_19065003": "Great! I'll bring you a few when I have some spare time!",
  "str_quest_chat_19065004": "Not really...",
  "str_quest_chat_19065005": "Ah, what a shame.",
  "str_quest_chat_19065006": "The boss lady just ordered a bunch of seafood shipments from me.",
  "str_quest_chat_19065007": "To tell the truth, she didn't want to order that much in the beginning.",
  "str_quest_chat_19065008": "But then I brought her a few samples to try for herself.",
  "str_quest_chat_19065009": "After that, she immediately agreed to buy a whole lot more, and at a higher price, to boot!",
  "str_quest_chat_19065010": "Our town's got the freshest and most affordable seafood out there! Nobody can say no to it!",
  "str_quest_chat_19065011": "Is the seafood on Sharkfang Island really that good?",
  "str_quest_chat_19065012": "I'm starting to feel a little curious now...",
  "str_quest_chat_19066001": "Hey, bro!",
  "str_quest_chat_19066002": "Vice didn't look too good when she was having lunch today. Everything alright with her?",
  "str_quest_chat_19066003": "Is Vice not feeling well? She didn't say anything to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_19066004": "Ah, she probably just pushed herself too hard while working out! I gave her some pointers, but it looks like they weren't a very good fit for her.",
  "str_quest_chat_19066005": "\"Pointers\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_19066006": "Yeah! Two days ago, she asked me, \"How are you still so strong when all you eat is vegetables every day?\"",
  "str_quest_chat_19066007": "I never really thought about it, you know? So I told her the truth: I had no idea why I was so strong, either!",
  "str_quest_chat_19066008": "Day in and day out, all I did was eat my veggies, go to work, and exercise... And eventually, I ended up like this!",
  "str_quest_chat_19066009": "Vice looked like she had just figured something out, so she thanked me and left without another word.",
  "str_quest_chat_19066010": "The very next day, she insisted on eating the same food as me, and said she was gonna crank up the intensity on her workouts...",
  "str_quest_chat_19066011": "But if you ask me, she looks like she's getting worse by the day! I really hope she's doing okay!",
  "str_quest_chat_19066012": "I-I'll go talk to her later...",
  "str_quest_chat_19067001": "Bro, you won't believe it! I rescued a kitten from a tree this morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_19067002": "It was so tiny... The little guy fit right in the palm of my hand! So stinkin' cute!",
  "str_quest_chat_19067003": "Good for you, Korgon! Were you planning on keeping it?",
  "str_quest_chat_19067004": "Well... That was the plan, at first.",
  "str_quest_chat_19067005": "But when I rescued it, the folks around me thought I was gonna eat the poor, little critter.",
  "str_quest_chat_19067006": "So as I was explaining myself to everyone, they took the kitty away from me.",
  "str_quest_chat_19067007": "That's when they handed it to a little girl...",
  "str_quest_chat_19067008": "Seeing how fond it was of her, I figured she must be the kitten's owner!",
  "str_quest_chat_19067009": "If so, I had no right to keep it for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_19067010": "They misunderstood you again, Korgon...",
  "str_quest_chat_19067011": "Yeah, but none of that matters as long as that kitty is safe and sound!",
  "str_quest_chat_19081001": "Why? Why did they steal my fries?",
  "str_quest_chat_19081002": "You're eating fries?",
  "str_quest_chat_19081003": "The cats ate your fries?",
  "str_quest_chat_19081004": "I'm not sure which of those is weirder...",
  "str_quest_chat_19081005": "Junk food is simply the best!",
  "str_quest_chat_19081006": "Not even the cats can resist the charm of fried food!",
  "str_quest_chat_19081007": "Wait a minute, should I not use the \"you shouldn't eat so late at night\" tone of voice?",
  "str_quest_chat_19081008": "Of course, this feeling is not as prominent as the discovery that cats eat fries!",
  "str_quest_chat_19081009": "O... kay...",
  "str_quest_chat_19101001": "We got a hot new offers!",
  "str_quest_chat_19101002": "Crunchy Munchy Crunch! Taste the greasy goodness in every bite!",
  "str_quest_chat_19101003": "Get 10% off if you order now!",
  "str_quest_chat_19101004": "Personal Heavy! Buff enforcers on demand!",
  "str_quest_chat_19101005": "Strong, tough, beat up whoever and whatever you want! Quality service at an affordable price!",
  "str_quest_chat_19101006": "Payment Reminder! Dear Boss, your service will be disconnected.",
  "str_quest_chat_19101007": "But for only 1,000 Nightium, a smooth connection is ensured for the entire year.",
  "str_quest_chat_19101008": "Don't spam me anymore!",
  "str_quest_chat_19101009": "Want to get more Star Flare? How about more Lumamber?",
  "str_quest_chat_19101010": "Hit the Black Market, where the price is beyond right.",
  "str_quest_chat_19101011": "You do ads for Sheol too?",
  "str_quest_chat_19101012": "It's called partnership.",
  "str_quest_chat_19101013": "Now how do I delete someone off the Friends list?",
  "str_quest_chat_19101014": "No, no, don't do it, boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19101015": "Our service is a must if you want to block a friend thoroughly.",
  "str_quest_chat_19101016": "We got Odi the comm expert to clean up the social media for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_19101017": "I give up. You could even turn that into a sales pitch.",
  "str_quest_chat_19101018": "Just a small part of my job.",
  "str_quest_chat_19101019": "Actually, I got good news for you, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19101020": "Get a mystery gift just for coming to the rec room.",
  "str_quest_chat_19101021": "Limited availability. First come, first serve!",
  "str_quest_chat_19101022": "Isn't it another spam?",
  "str_quest_chat_19151001": "A gorgeous morning, just for you, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19151002": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_19151003": "I made a one-of-a-kind must-have breakfast just for you! It'll push your energy levels through the roof!",
  "str_quest_chat_19151004": "It's the best breakfast you'll ever eat!",
  "str_quest_chat_19151005": "I have Wriggle Worm Pie, it's packed with protein.",
  "str_quest_chat_19151006": "And there's also Iced Gravel Juice to provide enough hydration to keep you going all day!",
  "str_quest_chat_19151007": "And, of course, the one-and-only desert specialty—lizard jerky!",
  "str_quest_chat_19151008": "Do you have any particular preference? I can deliver whatever you want to your door, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19151009": "Erm... I think I'll just go back to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_19151010": "Hey, Boss! How can you go on without buying anything... I mean, without breakfast!",
  "str_quest_chat_19152001": "Morning, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19152002": "Just so you know, something new just came in recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_19152003": "Are you charging for this new thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_19152004": "Boss, you really do know me best!",
  "str_quest_chat_19152005": "So what's this new thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_19152006": "Hehe, well...",
  "str_quest_chat_19152007": "What or who exactly is this new thing about?",
  "str_quest_chat_19152008": "The details are entirely dependent on the price you're willing to pay!",
  "str_quest_chat_19152009": "... You know what, I'm not that curious.",
  "str_quest_chat_19153001": "A gorgeous morning just for you, boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19153002": "Good morning, Jomu...",
  "str_quest_chat_19153003": "Good morning, dear boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19153004": "They say money can't buy back lost time, making mornings like this especially precious!",
  "str_quest_chat_19153005": "Yeah, I agree.",
  "str_quest_chat_19153006": "By calling you this early today, I figure I must've saved you quite a bit of precious morning time, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_19153007": "If that's true, I think a little compensation for my kindness might be in order! Does 10,000 Nightium sound fair to you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19153008": "I knew it!!",
  "str_quest_chat_19154001": "My dear boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19154002": "By now, I'm sure you've opened your eyes to see the start of a beautiful new day!",
  "str_quest_chat_19154003": "So why not let your wallet open, so it can greet the morning as well!",
  "str_quest_chat_19154004": "Wait, why the heck is my wallet opening by itself...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19154005": "Well, naturally... It must have picked up on the scent of my latest products!",
  "str_quest_chat_19154006": "And what's more, you're my best and most respected customer!",
  "str_quest_chat_19154007": "Which is why you get first pick of the batch, my friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_19154008": "Buy today, and I'll make sure you only pay sticker price on all these brand-new goods!",
  "str_quest_chat_19154009": "Not only that, I've got BOGO coupons and mystery prizes for only my best customers!",
  "str_quest_chat_19154010": "You can't afford to miss this, boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19154011": "... Boss? Hey! You still there, boss?",
  "str_quest_chat_19155001": "Good morning to you, my dear boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19155002": "Jomu! I-I don't have any money right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_19155003": "Oh don't say that, my dear boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19155004": "Only poor people talk about money like that! I'm sure a strong and capable boss like you can solve any problem with just the wave of a hand!",
  "str_quest_chat_19155005": "In fact, I have the perfect money-making opportunity to help with your little dilemma!",
  "str_quest_chat_19155006": "I have a bad feeling about this...",
  "str_quest_chat_19155007": "I'd like to open up a small shop aboard the Colossus. What do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_19155008": "Sounds alright.",
  "str_quest_chat_19155009": "Well, I am kinda tired of going out to buy snacks whenever we run out...",
  "str_quest_chat_19155010": "A small shop right here on Soroz would make things much more convenient.",
  "str_quest_chat_19155011": "I agree! It's a wonderful idea, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_19155012": "Sounds a little sketchy...",
  "str_quest_chat_19155013": "Sigh, I had no idea you had such little trust in me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19155014": "Honestly, when have I ever misled you?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19155015": "What exactly do you plan on selling, Jomu?",
  "str_quest_chat_19155016": "Oh, just snacks and other daily necessities!",
  "str_quest_chat_19155017": "I could also sell steaming-hot buns in the morning or late at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_19155018": "I could even offer cake and ice cream during lunch, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_19155019": "... Vice would go ballistic if you did that to her.",
  "str_quest_chat_19155020": "Oh come now, boss! Don't be so negative!",
  "str_quest_chat_19155021": "There are always risks involved when doing business, but it's the only way to make money!",
  "str_quest_chat_19156001": "My dear boss, can you guess what I found on my travels a few days ago?",
  "str_quest_chat_19156002": "Money?",
  "str_quest_chat_19156003": "A sucker?",
  "str_quest_chat_19156004": "No, no, no! I found an adorable, little puppy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19156005": "It was brown, with big, shiny eyes and long, floppy ears!",
  "str_quest_chat_19156006": "Oh, how I loved that puppy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19156007": "Do you want to keep it? Pets are allowed on the Colossus, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_19156008": "Well, since I adored it so very much...",
  "str_quest_chat_19156009": "I sold it to a Lumo Noble for a price worthy of my love for it!",
  "str_quest_chat_19156010": "... So that's what you meant when you said you \"loved\" it.",
  "str_quest_chat_19156011": "Oh, no, no! You misunderstand me, my friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_19156012": "After all, how could a puppy handle the lifestyle of an itinerant merchant like myself?",
  "str_quest_chat_19156013": "If it's just me, I can handle the dangers of the open road by either talking my way out of trouble or simply running away.",
  "str_quest_chat_19156014": "But a puppy? A puppy has no way of learning my worldly ways! They're too loyal, you see...",
  "str_quest_chat_19156015": "Which is why I wanted to find someone more stable, someone who could give that puppy a nice, loving home!",
  "str_quest_chat_19156016": "I suppose... But that didn't stop you from making money from the situation, did it?",
  "str_quest_chat_19156017": "Of course not! But I didn't expect you to understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_19156018": "After all, most people only cherish things when they come at a high cost.",
  "str_quest_chat_19156019": "So who in the world would cherish that poor puppy if it came for free?",
  "str_quest_chat_19157001": "Good morning, boss!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157002": "Hey Jomu! You're looking especially-happy today.",
  "str_quest_chat_19157003": "That's right, and it's because I have a big surprise just for you, boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157004": "... Forget I said anything, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_19157005": "Ah, now I know what you might be thinking!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157006": "But even though it might kill me to do so, I'm giving you this surprise at no charge! I promise!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157007": "W-What are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat_19157008": "Miss Barbara, the shining star of the Rediesel Wrench, is hosting a new and exciting concert soon!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157009": "And since you always treat me so hospitably, I've decided to repay your kindness by saving a ticket just for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157010": "That does sound like a good time...",
  "str_quest_chat_19157011": "So when's the concert supposed to take place?",
  "str_quest_chat_19157012": "That all depends on you!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157013": "On me?",
  "str_quest_chat_19157014": "This concert is adopting the latest \"crowdfunding\" system.",
  "str_quest_chat_19157015": "This means that funding for the concert will be donated by the audience members themselves! Those who participate in the crowdfunding will also receive a special gift!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157016": "Act now, and you can claim the title of \"First Investor,\" a prestigious and memorable honor!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157017": "Not only that, you'll also receive a \"Golden Handshake Ticket,\" which entitles you to a three-second handshake with Barbara herself!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157018": "There's no time to lose, so come join the fun!",
  "str_quest_chat_19157019": "I knew it...",
  "str_quest_chat_19161001": "A beautiful afternoon, just for you, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19161002": "...I recognize that voice.",
  "str_quest_chat_19161003": "What are you selling?",
  "str_quest_chat_19161004": "Is that really how you see me, Boss? That really makes me sad!",
  "str_quest_chat_19161005": "I'm just here to make sure you're in peak condition!",
  "str_quest_chat_19161006": "Lunch break should be a time of rest, a time for physical and mental relaxation.",
  "str_quest_chat_19161007": "A time to ease the tension of the day's work so far, and to alleviate you of all stress, allowing you to maintain a good mood for the rest of the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_19161008": "Your lunch break can also lessen the impact of a sleepless night, improving your efficiency in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_19161009": "You can also take a nap for half an hour. Yes, about half an hour is best.",
  "str_quest_chat_19161010": "So, you see, Boss? I really am here to take care of you, aren't I?",
  "str_quest_chat_19161011": "Why does it sound like you're reading from a script.",
  "str_quest_chat_19161012": "Ahaha! Well, whatever the case, feel free to tip me when you have the chance!",
  "str_quest_chat_19161013": "...I beg your pardon!?",
  "str_quest_chat_19162001": "Good afternoon, boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19162002": "Would you like some of our special desserts?",
  "str_quest_chat_19162003": "Crunchy Munchy Crunch, spicy lizard kebabs, and even the precious char-grilled sandworm liver!",
  "str_quest_chat_19162004": "We have everything!",
  "str_quest_chat_19162005": "Oh... No, I'll pass.",
  "str_quest_chat_19162006": "I had a lot for lunch, I'm too full to eat any more...",
  "str_quest_chat_19162007": "Oh, that's a shame.",
  "str_quest_chat_19162008": "Guess I won't be able to watch the flamboyant way you spend your Nightium.",
  "str_quest_chat_19163001": "Hehehe, boss?",
  "str_quest_chat_19163002": "Yo, boss?",
  "str_quest_chat_19163003": "Hey, boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19163004": "... Can I just ignore you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19163005": "Boss! I knew you wouldn't be so cold to me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19163006": "Are you trying to sell me something again? I'm not—",
  "str_quest_chat_19163007": "How can you say that? I only promote absolute necessities!",
  "str_quest_chat_19163008": "No. No need. I don't need anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_19163009": "Oh, I rarely get turned down so outright!",
  "str_quest_chat_19163010": "It seems, Boss, that it's not really that you don't need anything...",
  "str_quest_chat_19163011": "But that you don't have a cent on you, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_19163012": "I... I still have a bit of Nightium on me.",
  "str_quest_chat_19163013": "A little? Tsk, tsk.",
  "str_quest_chat_19163014": "I'll take my leave for now, Boss. I hope you have a great afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_19164001": "It's a scorching afternoon, Boss. Don't you want to support the startup of a youth from the desert?",
  "str_quest_chat_19164002": "Hmm, I'll pass.",
  "str_quest_chat_19164003": "You're so kind and considerate to everyone else, Boss. Why are you so cruel only to me?",
  "str_quest_chat_19164004": "Actually, I'd love to support you.",
  "str_quest_chat_19164005": "But honestly, Jomu, I really don't have that kind of money.",
  "str_quest_chat_19164006": "Ahem, if that's the case...",
  "str_quest_chat_19164007": "We can form a business partnership and share the wealth together, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19164008": "... That sounds even less believable than buying something from you!",
  "str_quest_chat_19181001": "Good evening, Boss. How was your day?",
  "str_quest_chat_19181002": "If you weren't trying to sell me stuff all day...",
  "str_quest_chat_19181003": "...it would've been decent.",
  "str_quest_chat_19181004": "Stuff? Everything I've shown you were well-designed and carefully chose, Boss! That's a very inappropriate word to describe my products!",
  "str_quest_chat_19181005": "I'm always thinking about what's best for you, Boss, from the bottom of my heart...",
  "str_quest_chat_19181006": "You see, the almighty Caelestite surely needs some portable weapons to protect himself?",
  "str_quest_chat_19181007": "I have throwing knives, razor-thin arrows, ultra-sharp daggers, and loads of other personal weapons to choose from!",
  "str_quest_chat_19181008": "And the best time to buy these kinds of things? Right now, of course! In the dead of night! Hehe!",
  "str_quest_chat_19181009": "...I'm sleeping, Jomu! Bye! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_19182001": "Dearest Boss, amicable Boss, respected Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19182002": "I'm sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_19182003": "Hey, don't be so cold! Let's negotiate!",
  "str_quest_chat_19182004": "Think about it. Rediesel Wrench has got a bunch of popular idols.",
  "str_quest_chat_19182005": "How's life on Colossus and working in the construction site?",
  "str_quest_chat_19182006": "Their fans would definitely want to hear all about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_19182007": "Tsk tsk, if this kind of innocuous gossip were to become known to the fans...",
  "str_quest_chat_19182008": "I can't imagine how much they would be willing to pay!",
  "str_quest_chat_19182009": "I-I'm sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_19182010": "Boss, your information doesn't add up!",
  "str_quest_chat_19182011": "Ugh... I'm sleeping! We'll talk about this some other time!",
  "str_quest_chat_19182012": "I pity you for passing on such a great opportunity!",
  "str_quest_chat_19183001": "Evening, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19183002": "Business has been pretty good lately!",
  "str_quest_chat_19183003": "Congrats, Jomu.",
  "str_quest_chat_19183004": "So, I decided not to sell anything to you today, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_19183005": "Rest well, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19183006": "Now that's rare, coming from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_19183007": "I'll resume my sales pitch to you tomorrow, hehehe.",
  "str_quest_chat_19183008": "... Well, I knew it would end this way.",
  "str_quest_chat_19184001": "This shop is open 24 hours!",
  "str_quest_chat_19184002": "Come in, handsome. Check out today's new products.",
  "str_quest_chat_19184003": "I'm going to bed. Let's do the sales chat another day.",
  "str_quest_chat_19184004": "Come on! Don't be so cold.",
  "str_quest_chat_19184005": "Now's the perfect time for some everything-must-go evening discounts.",
  "str_quest_chat_19184006": "90% off! Or more!",
  "str_quest_chat_19184007": "Wow, that's a first. You're offering discounts?",
  "str_quest_chat_19184008": "This Lumamber gift box was 99,999. Now it's only—",
  "str_quest_chat_19184009": "How much?",
  "str_quest_chat_19184010": "99,998!",
  "str_quest_chat_19184011": "That's not 90% off!",
  "str_quest_chat_19184012": "The 90% off is on this glass of water. It was 100 Nightium. Only 10 now!",
  "str_quest_chat_19184013": "Other awesome discounts are also waiting to be snapped up!",
  "str_quest_chat_19184014": "I should have known not to expect any better of you...",
  "str_quest_chat_19251001": "Morning! Today's a good day!",
  "str_quest_chat_19251002": "Morning... Is that Pengy?",
  "str_quest_chat_19251003": "Oh! So, you recognize me?",
  "str_quest_chat_19251004": "The smell of grilled fish must have drifted over to you somehow!",
  "str_quest_chat_19251005": "Erm... Just how did you start your morning...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19251006": "Let me tell you, Kuma can't have a fish grilled without burnt!",
  "str_quest_chat_19251007": "Burp... Grilled fish...",
  "str_quest_chat_19251008": "Come on... Barbecue in the morning? And in the room?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19261001": "It's too hot! Too hot!",
  "str_quest_chat_19261002": "Noontime is absolutely the worst time of the day!",
  "str_quest_chat_19261003": "It's a good thing we did that...",
  "str_quest_chat_19261004": "I feel much better now!",
  "str_quest_chat_19261005": "What did you do?",
  "str_quest_chat_19261006": "We ransacked the kitchen of all of its ice!",
  "str_quest_chat_19261007": "...?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19261008": "Oh no! I told you not to tell him!",
  "str_quest_chat_19261009": "Run, before he unleashes the Fireflies on us!",
  "str_quest_chat_19261010": "Wait! Hey! At least leave some of it behind!",
  "str_quest_chat_19262001": "Awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_19262002": "Yeah. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_19262003": "I need a favor. Send those Fireflies over, quick!",
  "str_quest_chat_19262004": "Huh? Hold on a sec, what's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_19262005": "My waterbed...",
  "str_quest_chat_19262006": "It sprang a leak.",
  "str_quest_chat_19262007": "It's so hot.",
  "str_quest_chat_19262008": "Huh...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19262009": "Long story short: I bought a waterbed from that conman Jomu.",
  "str_quest_chat_19262010": "Then that stupid bear sat on it and it burst.",
  "str_quest_chat_19262011": "Now the Lounge is full of water. So send the Fireflies to help clean up!",
  "str_quest_chat_19262012": "How on earth...!",
  "str_quest_chat_19263001": "Hey, buddy! It's Pengy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19263002": "Kuma, er... Kuma took a little fall just now!",
  "str_quest_chat_19263003": "He ended up breaking one of the chairs in the cafeteria. Sorry about that!",
  "str_quest_chat_19263004": "It's just a chair, don't worry about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_19263005": "Is Kuma okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_19263006": "Aw, he's fine! That big ol' bear is built pretty tough, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_19263007": "The problem is, right when he fell down...",
  "str_quest_chat_19263008": "He kinda landed on one of his grenades.",
  "str_quest_chat_19263009": "A-And then it exploded! All by itself!",
  "str_quest_chat_19263010": "Anyways, it might've damaged the walls and the floor just a teensy bit...",
  "str_quest_chat_19263011": "But it's all good, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_19263012": "... You guys were just messing with explosives in the cafeteria again, weren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19263013": "And don't try running off this time!",
  "str_quest_chat_19264001": "You're here too?",
  "str_quest_chat_19264002": "Hey, I know that voice... Kuma?",
  "str_quest_chat_19264003": "Did you need something from me?",
  "str_quest_chat_19264004": "Hey, pal! Pengy here!",
  "str_quest_chat_19264005": "Sorry about that, Kuma accidentally sat on the terminal just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_19264006": "Oh, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_19264007": "This sausage is tasty.",
  "str_quest_chat_19264008": "Sausage?",
  "str_quest_chat_19264009": "Oh, don't mind him! He's just hungry, that's all!",
  "str_quest_chat_19264010": "Buy more next time, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_19264011": "Buy more next time...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19264012": "Are you guys raiding the pantry right now?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19264013": "What? No way, come on! I told you, Kuma just pushed the wrong button!",
  "str_quest_chat_19264014": "Pengy says no more. We have to leave now.",
  "str_quest_chat_19264015": "Well, just make sure Vice doesn't catch you, or else she'll really make you pay...",
  "str_quest_chat_19265001": "Hiya, pal! Got some spare time to chat with your old buddy Pengy?",
  "str_quest_chat_19265002": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265003": "Now what should we talk about... Oh yeah! Lemme tell you how I got this scar on my face!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265004": "After Kuma and I ditched Northland, we traveled all the way to the Rediesel Desert together.",
  "str_quest_chat_19265005": "The wimpy Eclipsites we ran into along the way were no match for us...",
  "str_quest_chat_19265006": "Especially not me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265007": "See, even though Kuma's built like a tank and hits like one too, the guy's got no brains!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265008": "But thanks to my brilliant leadership and clever combat strategies...",
  "str_quest_chat_19265009": "We've managed to survive all this time!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265010": "The day I got this scar, we had just finished fighting in the Rediesel Desert for three days and three nights...",
  "str_quest_chat_19265011": "No! Make that five days and five nights of grueling combat!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265012": "That's impressive, Pengy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265013": "Hahaha! I knew you'd think so too, buddy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265014": "Although... Is it just me, or did I pick up a little sarcasm there?",
  "str_quest_chat_19265015": "Sounds a little exaggerated.",
  "str_quest_chat_19265016": "Whaddya mean, \"exaggerated\"?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265017": "Bah, you're still too young to understand the dangers of war, kid!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265018": "An Eclipsite attacked Pengy. He cried for three days.",
  "str_quest_chat_19265019": "Said he wasn't beautiful anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_19265020": "What the? G-Get off the terminal, Kuma!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_19265021": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_19265022": "Ahem... Don't listen to Kuma! He's the one who likes to exaggerate, not me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19266001": "Hey, pal? I was thinking...",
  "str_quest_chat_19266002": "Couldn't you install a pool somewhere on the Colossus...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19266003": "Kuma's been packing on the pounds lately, and the freezer ain't big enough for the two of us anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_19266004": "So now, we have to take turns cooling off in there!!",
  "str_quest_chat_19266005": "I'll think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_19266006": "You know, a pool might actually be a nice improvement...",
  "str_quest_chat_19266007": "The inside of the Colossus does get pretty hot sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat_19266008": "Not a chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_19266009": "Soroz isn't an amusement park, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_19266010": "If we have the means, I'd much rather improve other things, like performance!",
  "str_quest_chat_19266011": "Sigh... This sucks! At this rate, I'm gonna turn into penguin jerky!",
  "str_quest_chat_19266012": "We'll pick this up again after my turn in the freezer!",
  "str_quest_chat_19267001": "Ah... What a comfy afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_19267002": "You don't think it's too hot, Pengy?",
  "str_quest_chat_19267003": "Hey, how'd you know it was me?! See, I told you we got a special connection, buddy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19267004": "And it's never too hot when you're enjoying an ice-cold beer!",
  "str_quest_chat_19267005": "Didn't you just finish lunch? Careful not to give yourself a stomach ache!",
  "str_quest_chat_19267006": "Stomach ache? Hah! Only little kids like you get those!",
  "str_quest_chat_19267007": "A fully-grown penguin like me doesn't need to——",
  "str_quest_chat_19267008": "Uh, Pengy? What happened to the rest of your message?",
  "str_quest_chat_19267009": "Pengy went to the restroom.",
  "str_quest_chat_19267010": "I see... Well, I hope he's okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_19281001": "Stop sleeping! Come and help me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19281002": "Huh? Is that Kuma or Pengy?",
  "str_quest_chat_19281003": "It's me, the most handsome penguin around!",
  "str_quest_chat_19281004": "Oh, good evening, Pengy. What do you need?",
  "str_quest_chat_19281005": "Our room stinks!",
  "str_quest_chat_19281006": "It stinks? Strange...",
  "str_quest_chat_19281007": "The Fireflies didn't help you sort it out?",
  "str_quest_chat_19281008": "Well... I chased them all away!",
  "str_quest_chat_19281009": "...Well, let's try to solve the problem, first.",
  "str_quest_chat_19281010": "Why does your room smell?",
  "str_quest_chat_19281011": "Did you store fish in your room again?",
  "str_quest_chat_19281012": "It's not about the fish!",
  "str_quest_chat_19281013": "It's because I moved lots of ice in our room! To keep the fish fresh!",
  "str_quest_chat_19281014": "Maybe there are too much ice, and they're blocking the ventilation system... or something like that!",
  "str_quest_chat_19281015": "But just after we finish with the fish, Kuma... passed wind!",
  "str_quest_chat_19281016": "How to put this... This kind of deadly attack power... I'd like to develop it into a new weapon, right away!",
  "str_quest_chat_19281017": "Wait for the ice to melt, then your problem should be solved...",
  "str_quest_chat_19281018": "The vents won't be blocked anymore after the ice melt into water.",
  "str_quest_chat_19281019": "Hey, that's what I said!",
  "str_quest_chat_19282001": "Hey, it's so hot in here!",
  "str_quest_chat_19282002": "Can't you turn the air-con up?",
  "str_quest_chat_19282003": "The cooling on the Colossus is already maxed out!",
  "str_quest_chat_19282004": "Plus it's evening, it's much cooler than it is during the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_19282005": "But it's still hot.",
  "str_quest_chat_19282006": "You see, the big guy said so himself.",
  "str_quest_chat_19282007": "Figure it out, or we'll have to squeeze into the cafe's fridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_19282008": "Don't do that!",
  "str_quest_chat_19282009": "The fridge will explode!",
  "str_quest_chat_19351001": "Haha! Morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_19351002": "Morning. You seem happy?",
  "str_quest_chat_19351003": "Of course! I love the smell of burning in the morning, and after breakfast, that was all I could smell! Mmm—delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_19351004": "Was your breakfast burnt?",
  "str_quest_chat_19351005": "No, Boss, but I think somewhere on your Colossus was burning? It smelled good!",
  "str_quest_chat_19351006": "What!? And you just ignored it!?",
  "str_quest_chat_19351007": "How could I ignore it, Boss? I stood there and savored it for a few minutes.",
  "str_quest_chat_19351008": "...Fireflies! Put out that fire, now!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_19352001": "A lively day starts with a cup of diesel special!",
  "str_quest_chat_19352002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_19352003": "Only diesel oil?",
  "str_quest_chat_19352004": "Wait, are you supposed to drink diesel at all?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19352005": "Diesel gives me power!",
  "str_quest_chat_19352006": "Fancy a cup yourself, boss?",
  "str_quest_chat_19352007": "It's refreshing and satiating, and way better than fancy snacks!",
  "str_quest_chat_19352008": "Uh, I've had breakfast already.",
  "str_quest_chat_19352009": "Thanks for the offer!",
  "str_quest_chat_19352010": "Oh really? Next time then.",
  "str_quest_chat_19352011": "I'll prepare a big glass of diesel for you in advance!",
  "str_quest_chat_19353001": "Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_19353002": "Morning, Chainsaw Rick,",
  "str_quest_chat_19353003": "Are you alright?",
  "str_quest_chat_19353004": "Why so miserable so early?",
  "str_quest_chat_19353005": "Diesel...",
  "str_quest_chat_19353006": "Huh? What about it?",
  "str_quest_chat_19353007": "I haven't got... enough to drink.",
  "str_quest_chat_19353008": "Is a day without diesel even a real day?",
  "str_quest_chat_19361001": "Is it time for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_19361002": "Yep, I've finished already.",
  "str_quest_chat_19361003": "Oh, good, good. I've finished eating and I got some juice.",
  "str_quest_chat_19361004": "Ah... Who doesn't love a cup of fresh lemonade?",
  "str_quest_chat_19361005": "But it's lemon...",
  "str_quest_chat_19361006": "Boss, whatever you wanna say, it doesn't matter anyway. Like, if you were to say, why would anyone not like chainsaws?",
  "str_quest_chat_19361007": "I wasn't going to say anything about chainsaws...",
  "str_quest_chat_19361008": "Boss, do you think I'm handsome?",
  "str_quest_chat_19361009": "...Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_19361010": "Do you think drinking concentrated diesel oil would make me more charming?",
  "str_quest_chat_19361011": "Boss, you still there? Boss? You're... gone?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19361012": "... Next time, then! We shall continue this clash of minds next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_19362001": "What's your favorite flavor?",
  "str_quest_chat_19362002": "Whatever it is, it's definitely not diesel oil...",
  "str_quest_chat_19362003": "But thanks for thinking about me, Rick!",
  "str_quest_chat_19362004": "Boss, listen to me. Take a sip, and you'll get fired up!",
  "str_quest_chat_19362005": "But I'm getting ready to take a nap...",
  "str_quest_chat_19362006": "Really? Then take a sip and you will sleep well!",
  "str_quest_chat_19362007": "... Which is it then?",
  "str_quest_chat_19362008": "Give it a try and find out for yourself!",
  "str_quest_chat_19362009": "When it comes to something like that...",
  "str_quest_chat_19362010": "My answer will most likely be no.",
  "str_quest_chat_19362011": "That's too bad!",
  "str_quest_chat_19363001": "Good afternoon, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_19363002": "I did some thorough maintenance on my saw this morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_19363003": "Did you soak it in diesel?",
  "str_quest_chat_19363004": "Well, you could say that!",
  "str_quest_chat_19363005": "If you need, you could also try soaking Soroz in diesel!",
  "str_quest_chat_19363006": "Um... I don't think that'll necessary, Chainsaw Rick.",
  "str_quest_chat_19364001": "How about some diesel oil, sir?",
  "str_quest_chat_19364002": "Bread just doesn't taste the same without a nice cup of diesel!",
  "str_quest_chat_19364003": "So? Wanna have some with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_19364004": "Diesel, huh...",
  "str_quest_chat_19364005": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_19364006": "I've never tried drinking diesel before.",
  "str_quest_chat_19364007": "But if you can drink it, then I should be fine! Right, Chainsaw Rick?",
  "str_quest_chat_19364008": "Forget it...",
  "str_quest_chat_19364009": "I don't think I've seen anyone else drink diesel aside from you, Chainsaw Rick.",
  "str_quest_chat_19364010": "Well, Rabbie has! She loves the stuff!",
  "str_quest_chat_19364011": "Sure, it smells a little funny, and just about anything tastes better than it.",
  "str_quest_chat_19364012": "But nothing really revs you up like some good-quality diesel!",
  "str_quest_chat_19364013": "Yeah, uh... I think I'm still gonna pass...",
  "str_quest_chat_19365001": "Sir! Rabbie promised to help me clear out sandworms today!",
  "str_quest_chat_19365002": "Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat_19365003": "Does this mean you two will finally get some alone time together?",
  "str_quest_chat_19365004": "Originally, yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat_19365005": "Who's Rabbie?",
  "str_quest_chat_19365006": "Rabbie's, uh... Well, Rabbie's this super-cute bunny girl...",
  "str_quest_chat_19365007": "Her ears are just like the ones on my helmet... No, hers are way cuter than mine! A million times cuter!",
  "str_quest_chat_19365008": "Oh? Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_19365009": "But Clover insists on tagging along with us!",
  "str_quest_chat_19365010": "Something about being worried that we'll \"run into danger\"!",
  "str_quest_chat_19365011": "This chainsaw isn't just for looks, you know? If \"danger\" decides to rear its ugly head, I'll tear it right off!",
  "str_quest_chat_19365012": "Hahaha... Looks like your work's cut out for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_19366001": "Sir, can you kindly tell me why these Umbraton punks are even dumber than me?",
  "str_quest_chat_19366002": "I walked into a restaurant last night, and a bunch of drunken idiots started picking a fight with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_19366003": "Saying things like, \"Go back home to your mommy, kid! You ain't welcome here!\"",
  "str_quest_chat_19366004": "My \"mommy\"? How the heck would I know where she is?! Besides, anyone who gets in my face like that gets theirs turned into mincemeat!",
  "str_quest_chat_19366005": "Y-You didn't actually use your chainsaw to fight those guys, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19366006": "Nah, the owner said I'd have to pay for anything I ripped up with my saw, so I set it off to the side.",
  "str_quest_chat_19366007": "That's when those goons started laughing to themselves, saying that I was done for.",
  "str_quest_chat_19366008": "Puh-lease! Even a sandworm knows not to judge a book by its cover!",
  "str_quest_chat_19366009": "I ended up mopping the floor with those clowns before they could land a single punch.",
  "str_quest_chat_19366010": "Tch, buncha morons if you ask me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19366011": "Getting wasted like that only makes you dumber, which is why I only drink diesel!",
  "str_quest_chat_19366012": "Sounds like it turned into a really big mess... You sure you didn't get hurt?",
  "str_quest_chat_19366013": "Of course not, sir! Instead of worrying so much, you should try trusting me every once in a while!",
  "str_quest_chat_19367001": "Hey, is it lunch time yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_19367002": "Let me check... Almost, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_19367003": "Huh? That can't be right!",
  "str_quest_chat_19367004": "It's your turn to make lunch today, isn't it Chainsaw Rick?",
  "str_quest_chat_19367005": "Sigh... Yeah. At first, Vice asked me to chop up the vegetables...",
  "str_quest_chat_19367006": "But I said cutting them was taking too long! So I whipped out my chainsaw and shred through those veggies in no time!",
  "str_quest_chat_19367007": "That's when Vice told me that the vegetables were too messed up to make a meal out of them, and that I had wasted all of our ingredients.",
  "str_quest_chat_19367008": "So she kicked me out.",
  "str_quest_chat_19367009": "Looks like your cooking skills could use a little work, Chainsaw Rick.",
  "str_quest_chat_19367010": "But don't worry! Practice makes perfect, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_19367011": "\"Practice\"?! Aw, c'mon sir! Quit hitting me with that junk!",
  "str_quest_chat_19367012": "It's tearin' me apart!",
  "str_quest_chat_19367013": "Hahahah...",
  "str_quest_chat_19368001": "Uh-oh. Sir?",
  "str_quest_chat_19368002": "What is it? What happened this time?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19368003": "I accidentally dozed off.",
  "str_quest_chat_19368004": "Huh? D-Did something happen while you were asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_19368005": "Nah, nothing at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_19368006": "O-Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_19368007": "I'm serious, sir! Nothing happened!",
  "str_quest_chat_19368008": "It's just that your Colossus is way too comfy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19368009": "Up here, nobody forces you to take jobs that might kill you, and there aren't any enemies hiding around just waiting to ambush you!",
  "str_quest_chat_19368010": "And the chairs are so frickin' soft! I fell asleep without even realizing it!",
  "str_quest_chat_19368011": "Well, this place is also my home.",
  "str_quest_chat_19368012": "You should feel comfortable when you're at home, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_19368013": "\"Home\"... So this is what \"home\" is like, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_19368014": "Everyone's always shouting and fighting in the Rediesel Wrench. It's way too loud to get any sleep, at least during the day...",
  "str_quest_chat_19368015": "But aside from that, your Colossus ain't too different from our home in the desert!",
  "str_quest_chat_19368016": "Guess that's why I like it so much here!",
  "str_quest_chat_19368017": "Heh, glad to hear it!",
  "str_quest_chat_19461001": "It's time for lunch break, you know!?",
  "str_quest_chat_19461002": "Would you like to play a game with me later?",
  "str_quest_chat_19461003": "Is that Sork? Sure, what game are we playing?",
  "str_quest_chat_19461004": "Something quick and easy? Poker? UNO?",
  "str_quest_chat_19461005": "Who'll be playing with me, Sork or Bekk?",
  "str_quest_chat_19461006": "We'll both play with you, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_19461007": "Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19461008": "But then, Bekk will see my cards...",
  "str_quest_chat_19461009": "...then turn around and tell you!",
  "str_quest_chat_19461010": "No way!",
  "str_quest_chat_19461011": "Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19462001": "Time for lunch break again!",
  "str_quest_chat_19462002": "Are you planning to nap, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_19462003": "Yes, I'm pooped.",
  "str_quest_chat_19462004": "What's the fun in sleeping?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19462005": "No, I don't feel like sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_19462006": "Wanna come play board games?",
  "str_quest_chat_19462007": "No! You always win!",
  "str_quest_chat_19462008": "And Bekk always spies on my cards!",
  "str_quest_chat_19462009": "Not this time. Let's play something new!",
  "str_quest_chat_19462010": "Like what?",
  "str_quest_chat_19462011": "Rock paper scissors!",
  "str_quest_chat_19462012": "The loser must fly around the Colossus! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19462013": "Those who can't fly must hand in Nightium instead!",
  "str_quest_chat_19462014": "That's still unfair!",
  "str_quest_chat_19462015": "Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19463001": "I admired myself in the mirror all morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_19463002": "Oh? Who was it, actually? Sork or Bekk?",
  "str_quest_chat_19463003": "It was Sork.",
  "str_quest_chat_19463004": "It was Bekk.",
  "str_quest_chat_19463005": "...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19463006": "He really thinks he's handsome!",
  "str_quest_chat_19463007": "Well, she thinks she's attractive.",
  "str_quest_chat_19463008": "Um... I guess there's no room for my opinion.",
  "str_quest_chat_19463009": "... Anyone still there?",
  "str_quest_chat_19463010": "Hello? Sork? Bekk?",
  "str_quest_chat_19463011": "Never mind, they probably went off somewhere to fight. I'll come back later.",
  "str_quest_chat_19464001": "My teeth are so handsome today!",
  "str_quest_chat_19464002": "Your teeth? Are handsome?",
  "str_quest_chat_19464003": "Of course, clean and shiny teeth look more powerful.",
  "str_quest_chat_19464004": "Sometimes, Eclipsites run away as soon as they see them.",
  "str_quest_chat_19464005": "Which is why he's spent a whole morning brushing them!",
  "str_quest_chat_19464006": "That's essential work to keep my teeth looking their best!",
  "str_quest_chat_19481001": "You asleep yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_19481002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_19481003": "Good! We want to play a board game, but we're down a person.",
  "str_quest_chat_19481004": "By the way, which do you prefer: strategy games or negotiation-based games?",
  "str_quest_chat_19481005": "Strategy games.",
  "str_quest_chat_19481006": "Good answer!",
  "str_quest_chat_19481007": "Smart guys like us enjoy watching our plans unfold, instead of jabbering away all damn game!",
  "str_quest_chat_19481008": "Negotiation games.",
  "str_quest_chat_19481009": "Chirp! Negotiation!",
  "str_quest_chat_19481010": "See? Talking things out is way more fun! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19481011": "Hey! If we let PlayerName pick for us, we're still not gonna accept it!",
  "str_quest_chat_19481012": "Why don't we play another game to decide which board game we should play? Winner gets to choose!",
  "str_quest_chat_19481013": "G-Good luck, guys...",
  "str_quest_chat_19482001": "Hey, PlayerName! Got any mud around here?",
  "str_quest_chat_19482002": "Yep.",
  "str_quest_chat_19482003": "I think you might be able to find some in the flower beds.",
  "str_quest_chat_19482004": "Much appreciated!",
  "str_quest_chat_19482005": "Nope...",
  "str_quest_chat_19482006": "We don't really need mud aboard the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_19482007": "Ah well, guess I'll just have to make do.",
  "str_quest_chat_19482008": "Did something happen?",
  "str_quest_chat_19482009": "Bekk's looking for a snack, specifically that muddy stuff with her gun oil.",
  "str_quest_chat_19482010": "We don't have any lying around, and she's been squawking about it non-stop.",
  "str_quest_chat_19482011": "So now I'm hungry, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_19482012": "I was thinking, if I manage to fatten Bekk up a little, I could just eat her later.",
  "str_quest_chat_19482013": "You sure love cracking those kinds of jokes, Sork.",
  "str_quest_chat_19482014": "Huh? Who said I was joking?",
  "str_quest_chat_19482015": "If Bekk doesn't pipe down, I'm gonna make a meal out of her.",
  "str_quest_chat_19482016": "Liar! Quit trying to sound tough! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19483001": "We ran into those clowns again today. The ones who keep trying to copy our style.",
  "str_quest_chat_19483002": "Clowns! Posers! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19483003": "Who now?",
  "str_quest_chat_19483004": "That penguin and his polar bear. They look mean enough, but they're really just a pair of idiots.",
  "str_quest_chat_19483005": "Pengy! Chirp! Kuma! Chirp! Idiots!",
  "str_quest_chat_19483006": "Pengy and Kuma, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_19483007": "So you know them, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_19483008": "Then that means you know that those two are completely useless, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_19483009": "Useless! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19483010": "They even challenged us to a contest earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_19483011": "Something called \"Cannonball\"... I guess it's some sort of ball game, except you use a bomb instead.",
  "str_quest_chat_19483012": "I don't think they realized that we're specialists when it comes to long-range combat.",
  "str_quest_chat_19483013": "They tried to do something to the \"balls,\" but there's no way I wouldn't notice something so obvious.",
  "str_quest_chat_19483014": "So while they weren't looking, I had Bekk mess with the bombs a little.",
  "str_quest_chat_19483015": "Heheh... You should've seen that penguin with his tail feathers on fire! It was hilarious!",
  "str_quest_chat_19483016": "Heeheehee! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19483017": "You didn't seriously hurt them, did you...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19483018": "Of course not. We're professionals, after all; we would never go all out on amateurs like them.",
  "str_quest_chat_19483019": "We're merciful professionals! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19483020": "Th-That's a relief…",
  "str_quest_chat_19484001": "Chirp! Hiya!",
  "str_quest_chat_19484002": "Oh hey, Bekk! This is a little unusual, receiving a message from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_19484003": "Not unusual! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19484004": "Terminals are great! Typing's so much easier! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19484005": "I can type all day! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19484006": "I feel so free! Sweet, sweet freedom!!! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19484007": "I didn't realize talking was so hard on you, Bekk...",
  "str_quest_chat_19484008": "Talking eats up too much energy! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19484009": "Not a problem with typing, though! Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19484010": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_19484011": "Terminals are so much fun! Keep chatting with me, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_19484012": "Chirp!",
  "str_quest_chat_19484013": "Sorry, I didn't realize Bekk was chatting with you all this time. I just noticed her pecking the hell out of the terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat_19484014": "She doesn't really know her own strength sometimes. I was worried she would mess up the terminal, so I ate her. Problem solved.",
  "str_quest_chat_19484015": "Y-You didn't actually eat her, right...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19484016": "Heh. What do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_19485001": "Hey, still awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_19485002": "Yeah, I'm still up.",
  "str_quest_chat_19485003": "Bekk's already done for the night, but I can't fall asleep. Want to chat for a bit?",
  "str_quest_chat_19485004": "You know... I could even teach you a thing or two about negotiation.",
  "str_quest_chat_19485005": "Do you know the secret to any successful negotiation?",
  "str_quest_chat_19485006": "I don't...",
  "str_quest_chat_19485007": "It's all about \"give and take.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_19485008": "Take Bekk and I, for example.",
  "str_quest_chat_19485009": "During negotiations, I do the gun-showing and she does the talking.",
  "str_quest_chat_19485010": "The \"take\" here is showing our gun. It makes the target nervous, see?",
  "str_quest_chat_19485011": "The \"give,\" on the other hand, is the talking. Talking makes the target think there's still room to work things out.",
  "str_quest_chat_19485012": "So as long as you control the \"give\" and the \"take,\" you can control the tempo of the negotiation and achieve whatever results you want.",
  "str_quest_chat_19485013": "Otherwise, you're just at the mercy of the other side.",
  "str_quest_chat_19485014": "I see... Thanks a lot, Sork!",
  "str_quest_chat_19485015": "Have you and Bekk ever failed during a negotiation?",
  "str_quest_chat_19485016": "What should you do in that situation?",
  "str_quest_chat_19485017": "You know, I don't think we've ever failed at a single negotiation in our time together.",
  "str_quest_chat_19485018": "Because when negotiations fall through, bullets always manage to get things done!",
  "str_quest_chat_19486001": "Sorry PlayerName, but Bekk needs to rest all day tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_19486002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_19486003": "She flew into a tree earlier. Her head is killing her.",
  "str_quest_chat_19486004": "Bekk... Flew into a tree?",
  "str_quest_chat_19486005": "Chirp! Liar! Sork got distracted by a pretty girl and ran into me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19486006": "Hahahah! So that's what happened!",
  "str_quest_chat_19486007": "Can it, Bekk! I'm a professional sharpshooter! How could I afford to lose focus during a job?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19486008": "Chirp! Liar!",
  "str_quest_chat_19486009": "Chirp! Liar!",
  "str_quest_chat_19486010": "Hahahah! So this was Sork's weakness all along!",
  "str_quest_chat_19486011": "A-Anyways, we need our rest tomorrow! Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_19486012": "Chirp! Get back here, Sork! You owe me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19551001": "The wind in the morning is cooler than that at noon, and warmer than that at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_19551002": "It's a very comfortable wind indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_19551003": "You can enjoy the breeze any time on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_19551004": "Just be careful not to catch a cold.",
  "str_quest_chat_19551005": "Okay, thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_19551006": "I'll be careful.",
  "str_quest_chat_19552001": "Hey, Navigator, I hear you have rabbit pajamas.",
  "str_quest_chat_19552002": "I'm so jealous. Do you know where I could buy one?",
  "str_quest_chat_19552003": "Vice and Carleen bought them for me. You could ask them?",
  "str_quest_chat_19552004": "Oh. Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_19552005": "You sure like rabbits, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19552006": "Y-Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_19552007": "Any time I see something cute, I want to have it for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_19561001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_19561002": "Good afternoon. Need something?",
  "str_quest_chat_19561003": "I-I'd like to thank you...",
  "str_quest_chat_19561004": "Thank me? For what?",
  "str_quest_chat_19561005": "M-Mainly... for keeping the windows open recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_19561006": "Compared to the breeze on the land, the sensation of the wind blowing through the Colossus is very special.",
  "str_quest_chat_19561007": "The wind here feels smoother and... freer...",
  "str_quest_chat_19561008": "And I get to eat carrots at noon every day...",
  "str_quest_chat_19561009": "F-Forget I said that! Anyway! Thank you very much! Good afternoon! Goodbye!",
  "str_quest_chat_19561010": "Carrots? What do carrots have to do with the wind?",
  "str_quest_chat_19561011": "...Well, good afternoon, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat_19562001": "Good afternoon. H-how was your morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_19562002": "Not bad.",
  "str_quest_chat_19562003": "That's good to hear...",
  "str_quest_chat_19562004": "It was okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_19562005": "You can s-save your troubles for the afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_19562006": "How was your morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_19562007": "The same as always... I spent it enjoying the wind...",
  "str_quest_chat_19562008": "That sounds wonderful.",
  "str_quest_chat_19563001": "Sorry to bother, but may I have a moment of your time...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19563002": "What's up, Clover?",
  "str_quest_chat_19563003": "Pardon, but have you seen a white... And fluffy...",
  "str_quest_chat_19563004": "A white and fluffy what?",
  "str_quest_chat_19563005": "... Bunny charm.",
  "str_quest_chat_19563006": "A bunny charm?",
  "str_quest_chat_19563007": "Sorry, but I haven't.",
  "str_quest_chat_19563008": "Does it belong to you, Clover?",
  "str_quest_chat_19563009": "N-No! It's not mine...",
  "str_quest_chat_19563010": "But if you see it, please give it to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_19563011": "That poor, defenseless creature needs my protection.",
  "str_quest_chat_19563012": "Ah, sure thing! I understand!",
  "str_quest_chat_19564001": "You do? You understand the feeling of wanting to keep such beautiful things in sight at all times?",
  "str_quest_chat_19564002": "I do!",
  "str_quest_chat_19564003": "After all, who doesn't like to look at the things they find beautiful?",
  "str_quest_chat_19564004": "Yes, you're right...",
  "str_quest_chat_19564005": "I don't...",
  "str_quest_chat_19564006": "I mean, there are lots of things I find beautiful in the world...",
  "str_quest_chat_19564007": "But I don't want to preserve them just so I can keep looking at them, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_19564008": "I-Is that so...",
  "str_quest_chat_19564009": "I should set free the things that I love...",
  "str_quest_chat_19564010": "And quietly protect that freedom from afar. That should be enough.",
  "str_quest_chat_19564011": "Just remember, stalking others is a bad thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_19564012": "Vice told me about it earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_19564013": "About how you've been following a certain rabbit from the shadows.",
  "str_quest_chat_19564014": "Th-That sounds like hearsay to me. You shouldn't believe rumors like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_19565001": "G-Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_19565002": "I'd like to explain something to you. My quiet way of doing things...",
  "str_quest_chat_19565003": "Is actually an advanced combat technique.",

  "str_quest_chat_19666003": "There's still a while before lunch time...",
  "str_quest_chat_19666004": "Why don't you grab a snack to hold you over until then?",
  "str_quest_chat_19666005": "Sausage! Bacon! Cake! Cookies!",
  "str_quest_chat_19666006": "Y-You can't just eat meat and junk food! You have to eat your vegetables, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_19666007": "Wow, I can't believe I'm actually saying that to someone...",
  "str_quest_chat_19666008": "Veggies stink! We won't eat unless it's sweet!",
  "str_quest_chat_19666009": "Patty doesn't like eating gross stuff! Patsy bites people when she's angry!",
  "str_quest_chat_19666010": "F-Fine, I'll do my best to make you something tasty!",

  "str_quest_chat_19667006": "Yep!",
  "str_quest_chat_19667007": "I know about emotions.",
  "str_quest_chat_19667008": "It's like when you're hungry... You feel bad, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_19667009": "That's a kind of emotion.",
  "str_quest_chat_19667010": "Is Patty hungry? Patsy's not hungry at all. That makes no sense!",
  "str_quest_chat_19667011": "I don't know about emotions.",
  "str_quest_chat_19667012": "Why do you ask, all of a sudden...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19667013": "Anyways, I don't know much about emotions, either.",
  "str_quest_chat_19667014": "Puppy doesn't know? Does that mean Puppy doesn't have emotions?",
  "str_quest_chat_19667015": "I-I don't think it matters if you understand them or not...",
  "str_quest_chat_19667016": "At the very least, I know you two have emotions.",
  "str_quest_chat_19667017": "And that should be good enough!",

  "str_quest_chat_19681002": "Good evening, Puppy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19681003": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_19681004": "Hehe, come play with us doggies!",
  "str_quest_chat_19681005": "We'll roast you on the spit!",
  "str_quest_chat_19681006": "We'll chase you and bite your behind!",
  "str_quest_chat_19681007": "Woof, we're just kidding!",
  "str_quest_chat_19681008": "Don't any of you need sleep?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19681009": "Play is more important than sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_19681010": "Let's go, let's go! We'll find someone else to play with!",
  "str_quest_chat_19681011": "Hey, don't make too much ruckus!",
  "str_quest_chat_19682001": "Time for a midnight snack! Woof!",
  "str_quest_chat_19682002": "Puppy! Puppy! Come eat!",
  "str_quest_chat_19682003": "What're you going to have?",
  "str_quest_chat_19682004": "I found some dried fish in the fridge!",
  "str_quest_chat_19682005": "They're delicious and crispy!",
  "str_quest_chat_19682006": "I saved the last one for you, Puppy.",
  "str_quest_chat_19682007": "Hang on. I don't remember putting any dried fish in the fridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_19682008": "Did Philyshy put them there!?",
  "str_quest_chat_19761001": "...Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_19761002": "Oh hey, White Dwarf! Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_19761003": "...Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_19761004": "Yep! What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19761005": "...Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_19761006": "Then... is there something you need?",
  "str_quest_chat_19761007": "...No.",
  "str_quest_chat_19761008": "Huh? Then... did you just want to remind me to eat lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_19761009": "I wanted to... practice social interactions with you, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_19761010": "Did I... say something wrong just now...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19761011": "No, not at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_19761012": "I'm touched that you are concerned about me.",
  "str_quest_chat_19761013": "Then can I... still contact you in the future?",
  "str_quest_chat_19761014": "Of course you can!",
  "str_quest_chat_19762001": "Now is the time of day when the sun is at its brightest.",
  "str_quest_chat_19762002": "Yeah, it's really bright...",
  "str_quest_chat_19762003": "The evening will not be far away after noon.",

  "str_quest_chat_19762005": "Every star undergoes the same cycle—Birth, Maturity, Fall...",
  "str_quest_chat_19762006": "Eventually, it will be reborn into another planet through some explosion or fusion.",
  "str_quest_chat_19762007": "What do you think, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_19762008": "Well... I can't say for sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_19762009": "Sunrise and sunset are normal phenomena, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_19762010": "That's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_19762011": "It's the ordinary things that are unnoteworthy...",
  "str_quest_chat_19762012": "But I once lived underground for 17 years.",
  "str_quest_chat_19762013": "17 long years in total darkness.",
  "str_quest_chat_19762014": "So for me...",
  "str_quest_chat_19762015": "The midday sun and the present moment...",
  "str_quest_chat_19762016": "are all worth cherishing!",
  "str_quest_chat_19762017": "Is that... so?",
  "str_quest_chat_19763001": "Morning work... is over.",
  "str_quest_chat_19763002": "Afternoon work... will start shortly.",
  "str_quest_chat_19763003": "Lunch was delicious today!",
  "str_quest_chat_19763004": "Your job is so cool!",
  "str_quest_chat_19763005": "... Is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_19763006": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_19763007": "... Fine. It seems that life isn't that boring after all...",
  "str_quest_chat_19764001": "... Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_19764002": "This is how you use a terminal, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_19764003": "That's right!",
  "str_quest_chat_19764004": "I see... Thank you for providing me with such a useful device.",
  "str_quest_chat_19764005": "However, I don't think I'll be using it ever again.",
  "str_quest_chat_19764006": "But I still wanted to express my appreciation.",
  "str_quest_chat_19764007": "What do you mean, you won't use it anymore...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19764008": "Don't mention it. Feel free to use it whenever you want!",
  "str_quest_chat_19764009": "It's just that... I have no need to interact with other people.",
  "str_quest_chat_19764010": "I just really have no need for it. I'm terribly sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat_19764011": "It's okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_19764012": "You know, you don't have to be so polite with me all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_19764013": "Just be yourself when you're on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_19764014": "Very well...",
  "str_quest_chat_19765001": "The sun is so bright today. Can I stay in the Corridor for a while?",
  "str_quest_chat_19765002": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_19765003": "By the way, you don't need to ask permission for something small like this!",
  "str_quest_chat_19765004": "... Very well.",
  "str_quest_chat_19765005": "But if the sun is really bothering you...",
  "str_quest_chat_19765006": "Why don't I have Soroz change course?",
  "str_quest_chat_19765007": "That isn't necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat_19765008": "No matter how dazzling the sun may be, there will come a day when its flames are extinguished, as well...",
  "str_quest_chat_19765009": "So there's really no need to worry about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_19765010": "I-I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_19766001": "Pardon me, but may I take my lunch back to my room?",
  "str_quest_chat_19766002": "Of course! You can eat wherever you want!",
  "str_quest_chat_19766003": "Still, I feel like I should ask...",
  "str_quest_chat_19766004": "Don't you like eating with everyone?",
  "str_quest_chat_19766005": "Don't you enjoy eating in such a lively place?",
  "str_quest_chat_19766006": "That's one way of putting it, yes. B-But it's no one's fault except mine...",
  "str_quest_chat_19766007": "I don't want to eat with everyone because I don't deserve to eat with them.",
  "str_quest_chat_19766008": "I see. Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_19766009": "There are plenty of folks here who prefer to eat by themselves, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_19766010": "They usually take their meals in their rooms, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_19766011": "That's probably why you've never seen them during lunch, White Dwarf.",
  "str_quest_chat_19766012": "But trust me, there are plenty of other people who do it, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_19766013": "You mean to say... There are many others just like me? Please don't joke like that...",
  "str_quest_chat_19766014": "... In any case, thank you for granting me your permission.",
  "str_quest_chat_19767001": "I apologize if the scars on my arms trouble you in any way.",
  "str_quest_chat_19767002": "I'll do my best to hide them from now on...",
  "str_quest_chat_19767003": "Scars? Are you hurt?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19767004": "Not exactly, no. I just...",
  "str_quest_chat_19767005": "Have a habit of scratching my arms at times without realizing it.",
  "str_quest_chat_19767006": "Vice accidentally saw me doing so earlier today. It gave her quite the shock.",
  "str_quest_chat_19767007": "I'm sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat_19767008": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_19767009": "I know it's a disgusting habit of mine, but I just can't stop.",
  "str_quest_chat_19767010": "If you find it too appalling, I could always leave this place.",
  "str_quest_chat_19767011": "No way! It doesn't bother us at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_19767012": "Uh... It's alright!",
  "str_quest_chat_19767013": "If you can't stop yourself sometimes... It's probably best if you let nature take its course.",
  "str_quest_chat_19767014": "But whatever you decide to do is perfectly fine with me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19767015": "You know, you sound so very much like Sekar sometimes...",
  "str_quest_chat_19767016": "It's uncanny, really.",
  "str_quest_chat_19768001": "Erm...",
  "str_quest_chat_19768002": "I just had a nightmare.",
  "str_quest_chat_19768003": "There were screams, and flames, and a man who had turned into an Eclipsite. His body was covered in blood, and he was frantically tearing everything apart...",
  "str_quest_chat_19768004": "Then there was an airship falling from the sky, as though the heavens themselves were collapsing...",
  "str_quest_chat_19768005": "After that, Mother... Mother was crushed by the falling heavens into two halves...",
  "str_quest_chat_19768006": "And then... I woke up.",
  "str_quest_chat_19768007": "But the screams still hadn't gone away.",
  "str_quest_chat_19768008": "After a while, I realized that the screams were coming from my own mouth.",
  "str_quest_chat_19768009": "I didn't disturb you, did I...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19768010": "I'm sorry, but I wasn't able to get in contact with Sekar.",
  "str_quest_chat_19768011": "So the next person I thought of was you...",
  "str_quest_chat_19768012": "Are you feeling okay...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19768013": "I don't know...",
  "str_quest_chat_19768014": "But I feel a bit calmer after telling you about my nightmare.",
  "str_quest_chat_19768015": "I'm going to get a drink of water now.",
  "str_quest_chat_19768016": "Do you need me to come stay with you for a while?",
  "str_quest_chat_19768017": "No, thank you. It's best if you don't see me like this right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_19768018": "... Don't worry about me. I'll go talk to Sekar as soon as I get the chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_19768019": "Sure thing. Take care of yourself, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_19851001": "Good morning! Remember to vote for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19851002": "Morning, Brock... What do you want me to vote for?",
  "str_quest_chat_19851003": "The Colossus Popularity Poll! All I need is your vote to be crowned the most popular person on board!",
  "str_quest_chat_19851004": "Wait a second... who else is participating in the poll?",
  "str_quest_chat_19851005": "Just me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19851006": "...And how many people have you asked to vote for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19851007": "Just you!",
  "str_quest_chat_19851008": "...I think I'm gonna go back to bed now.",
  "str_quest_chat_19851009": "Huh? Hey, don't go! Vote for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19852001": "Morning! Wanna work out with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_19852002": "Work out...? M-Maybe next time...",
  "str_quest_chat_19852003": "You don't sound convincing just now, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_19852004": "I read something earlier that says when a person hesitates before refusing an offer, it means they secretly want to accept it.",
  "str_quest_chat_19852005": "You... actually read?",
  "str_quest_chat_19852006": "Duh! In fact, that's my second book, which I'm still reading!",
  "str_quest_chat_19852007": "Is that... Really something to be proud about?",
  "str_quest_chat_19852008": "Anyways, when I say no, it's because I mean no.",
  "str_quest_chat_19852009": "How could you be so cold-hearted?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19853001": "Yo, good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_19853002": "Morning, Brock!",
  "str_quest_chat_19853003": "Haha! What a vigorous response!",
  "str_quest_chat_19853004": "Oh yeah, I got better looking. Did you notice?",
  "str_quest_chat_19853005": "I'm sure I didn't.",
  "str_quest_chat_19853006": "Really? Well, now you do.",
  "str_quest_chat_19853007": "...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19853008": "See ya, gotta go show off my coolness!",
  "str_quest_chat_19853009": "All right...",
  "str_quest_chat_19861001": "Fine, I guess I could always challenge Sinsa instead!",
  "str_quest_chat_19861002": "Good luck.",
  "str_quest_chat_19861003": "Who do you think would win?",
  "str_quest_chat_19861004": "... *Cough*",
  "str_quest_chat_19861005": "Who do you think would win?",
  "str_quest_chat_19861006": "Who do you think would win?",
  "str_quest_chat_19861007": "Who do you think would win?",
  "str_quest_chat_19861008": "Stop spamming me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19861009": "You would win! There, happy now?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19861010": "Really? Wow, I gotta show this to Sinsa! He better watch out, because the Navigator's got my back now!",
  "str_quest_chat_19861011": "Hey! Knock that off! I was just trying to get you to leave me alone!",
  "str_quest_chat_19862001": "Good afternoon! What'd you eat today?",
  "str_quest_chat_19862002": "Just a normal lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_19862003": "Oh.",
  "str_quest_chat_19862004": "Just a normal lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_19862005": "Brock? You are copying me...",
  "str_quest_chat_19862006": "Is something the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_19862007": "Shouldn't you be asking what I had for lunch, like a good friend would do?",
  "str_quest_chat_19862008": "...What did you have for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_19862009": "Nunya! As in... none of ya business! Hahahaha!",
  "str_quest_chat_19862010": "...Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_19863001": "Do you wanna participate in a marathon?",
  "str_quest_chat_19863002": "What... We just had a meal!",
  "str_quest_chat_19863003": "And... a marathon is too much for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19863004": "That's the point! We need exercise! Men can't slack off!",
  "str_quest_chat_19863005": "I heard that if you run a marathon right after a meal...",
  "str_quest_chat_19863006": "Your stomach's gonna rupture, even explode!",
  "str_quest_chat_19863007": "Oh... Is that true...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19863008": "Believe me! It's a fact passed down my race!",
  "str_quest_chat_19863009": "I... I'll stay indoors and clean my shoes then...",
  "str_quest_chat_19864001": "56... 57...",
  "str_quest_chat_19864002": "What are you doing now, Brock?",
  "str_quest_chat_19864003": "I'm counting the sweat rolling down my handsome face.",
  "str_quest_chat_19864004": "... Why would you do that?",
  "str_quest_chat_19864005": "Sinsa counted 86 last time!",
  "str_quest_chat_19864006": "Don't you know me by now? I have to be better than him at everything!",
  "str_quest_chat_19864007": "I need to push myself harder in training this afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_19864008": "... I'm not sure what to say...",
  "str_quest_chat_19864009": "Wish me luck!",
  "str_quest_chat_19864010": "G-good luck, Brock.",
  "str_quest_chat_19864011": "Good! I feel super encouraged!",
  "str_quest_chat_19864012": "Thank you, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_19864013": "You're welcome...",
  "str_quest_chat_19881001": "Good evening! I've been really lucky today!",
  "str_quest_chat_19881002": "I already have a bad feeling about this...",
  "str_quest_chat_19881003": "You really need to change your attitude towards me, bro!",
  "str_quest_chat_19881004": "So what happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_19881005": "Today, in my room... I found a huge bag of sand!",
  "str_quest_chat_19881006": "I have no idea when I brought it on board, but... It has this really familiar smell!",
  "str_quest_chat_19881007": "So now, the hallway in Colossus is like one giant sandbox!",
  "str_quest_chat_19881008": "Hahaha! Nothing quite like the feeling of sand between your toes, am I right?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19881009": "Y... You poured sand all over the hallway floors?!",
  "str_quest_chat_19881010": "The Fireflies! Haven't they cleaned it all up yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_19881011": "Oh, don't worry, I made sure to make them nice and dizzy, so they wouldn't get in the way.",
  "str_quest_chat_19881012": "Brock... that's too over!",
  "str_quest_chat_19882001": "Something awesome is about to happen! Wanna come see?",
  "str_quest_chat_19882002": "Good evening, Brock. What awesome thing is happening now?",
  "str_quest_chat_19882003": "They're about to hold a contest to see who can drink the most water on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_19882004": "And who exactly is \"they\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_19882005": "I don't know, but they left a note on my door.",
  "str_quest_chat_19882006": "And you don't think that someone might be pulling a prank on you?",
  "str_quest_chat_19882007": "Whaaa? No way! Unless... are you the one who left the note on my door?",
  "str_quest_chat_19882008": "Why would I hold a competition like that...?",
  "str_quest_chat_19882009": "It wasn't me, but I'm positive that someone is trying to trick you.",
  "str_quest_chat_19882010": "Huh? Then it should be fine, right? Just come and see!",
  "str_quest_chat_19882011": "...I'm not going! Get some rest! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_19883001": "Good evening, Navigator! I gave my baby a nice makeover today!",
  "str_quest_chat_19883002": "And it cost me a pretty penny!",
  "str_quest_chat_19883003": "Baby?",
  "str_quest_chat_19883004": "You mean your biceps?",
  "str_quest_chat_19883005": "Well, I guess you could call them my babies, sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_19883006": "But I was talking about Powerball!",
  "str_quest_chat_19883007": "I got it a new paint job today, so...",
  "str_quest_chat_19883008": "Tons of people were drawn over and came to chat with me!",
  "str_quest_chat_19883009": "What did they say?",
  "str_quest_chat_19883010": "They asked me which shop did the job! It must be because they think the coloring is so unique!",
  "str_quest_chat_19883011": "They pushed me to tell them the name of the shop!",
  "str_quest_chat_19883012": "When I told them I did it myself, they exhaled in relief and took off.",
  "str_quest_chat_19883013": "They must've been upset that they couldn't pretty up their cars like I did Powerball!",
  "str_quest_chat_19883014": "Let me tell you, Navigator, half red and half green go together like chocolate and peanut butter!",
  "str_quest_chat_19883015": "Whatever you say, Brock...",
  "str_quest_chat_19951001": "Good morning. You should treasure the Nightium in your possession.",
  "str_quest_chat_19951002": "Morning, Michenny!",
  "str_quest_chat_19951003": "Ah, unfortunately... The Nightium in my possession isn't very much to begin with...",
  "str_quest_chat_19951004": "Then you should spend the day reflecting on why that is.",
  "str_quest_chat_19951005": "S-Sure... I'll get right on that...",
  "str_quest_chat_19951006": "I truly hope you mean that.",
  "str_quest_chat_19952001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_19952002": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_19952003": "Breakfast is an indispensable part of your day, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_19952004": "That's right! I'm having breakfast right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_19952005": "Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_19952006": "Of course. I always have my breakfast at this exact time... Every single day... And not a second too early or too late.",
  "str_quest_chat_19952007": "That's... really dedicated of you, Michenny.",
  "str_quest_chat_19981001": "Good evening. Now, you must make a choice.",
  "str_quest_chat_19981002": "Good evening, Michenny... What choice are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat_19981003": "To summarize the events of today... Or to revitalize yourself for tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_19981004": "Uh... You mean I have to choose between writing in my journal or going to bed... right?",
  "str_quest_chat_19981005": "Then I'll write in my journal...",
  "str_quest_chat_19981006": "A wise choice, and a valuable habit to maintain.",
  "str_quest_chat_19981007": "I think I'll just go to bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_19981008": "A decent decision, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat_19981009": "What about you? Shouldn't you get some rest soon, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_19981010": "Thank you for your concern, but I still have to check the books.",
  "str_quest_chat_19981011": "Farewell.",
  "str_quest_chat_19982001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_19982002": "Good evening, Michenny.",
  "str_quest_chat_19982003": "There don't seem to be any strict rules or regulations aboard your Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_19982004": "Uh... Haha...",
  "str_quest_chat_19982005": "It's true... We don't really run a tight ship around here.",
  "str_quest_chat_19982006": "But don't you find this method too disorganized and susceptible to mishaps?",
  "str_quest_chat_19982007": "I think it's fine, as long as everybody can relax while they're here.",
  "str_quest_chat_19982008": "After all, everyone works hard enough these days.",
  "str_quest_chat_19982009": "So that's your rationale behind this...",
  "str_quest_chat_19982010": "I understand. I wish you an early night, and pleasant dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_19982011": "...Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983002": "Good evening, Michenny.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983003": "I've found some inconsistencies in the cargo list when I was going over it.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983004": "What're they?",
  "str_quest_chat_19983005": "10 more cookies that we've had for dessert today were consumed than expected.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983006": "Any idea why this is so?",
  "str_quest_chat_19983007": "P-Perhaps Raphael ate them?",
  "str_quest_chat_19983008": "Raphael was with the three other Angels, so she did not have the time to do so.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983009": "Please answer my question honestly.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983010": "Well... I'll come clean. It was me.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983011": "The cookies taste so good. I couldn't resist them...",
  "str_quest_chat_19983012": "Okay, I'll admit it, I ate the cookies...",
  "str_quest_chat_19983013": "Telling the truth is a wise choice.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983014": "Now then, you'll need to pay the price for your actions.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983015": "Um... S-Should I pay with Nightium?",
  "str_quest_chat_19983016": "A judgement has been made.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983017": "According to the nutrition plan set out by Vice, you'll be prohibited from eating dessert for the next ten days.",
  "str_quest_chat_19983018": "How could you be so cruel!",
  "str_quest_chat_20051001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_20051002": "Good morning, Jane!",
  "str_quest_chat_20051003": "The Fireflies made our breakfast this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_20051004": "I noticed your plates were empty when they were carrying out earlier. I take it you enjoyed breakfast today?",
  "str_quest_chat_20051005": "Uh... I-I think I was just hungrier than usual this morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_20051006": "Oh, I don't particularly care for the reason. I was just taking notes of what I saw, nothing more.",
  "str_quest_chat_20051007": "Goodbye. I hope the rest of your day runs smoothly.",
  "str_quest_chat_20052001": "You stayed up late last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20052002": "H-How'd you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_20052003": "I haven't come out of my room yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_20052004": "I'm in the kitchen right now, and your coffee cup says it all...",
  "str_quest_chat_20052005": "You drank a cup of coffee with four shots of espresso.",
  "str_quest_chat_20052006": "It seems like something has been troubling you lately. Perhaps I should go make note of it, as well...",
  "str_quest_chat_20052007": "I... I was just reading a story last night, and lost track of the time...",
  "str_quest_chat_20052008": "A story? ...I'll make note of that, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_20052009": "...Ah, crap! I shouldn't have said that!",
  "str_quest_chat_20061001": "Good afternoon. Are you taking your afternoon nap, now?",
  "str_quest_chat_20061002": "No, just eating my lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_20061003": "Do you generally eat lunch at this time?",
  "str_quest_chat_20061004": "Yeah... most of the time, I can't really say for sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_20061005": "Then, do you take a brief nap after finishing your lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_20061006": "If I don't have anything else to attend to, then yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_20061007": "Are you... recording all of my answers?",
  "str_quest_chat_20061008": "Of course. An in-depth record of a Caelestite's daily routine could be important reference material in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_20062001": "Good afternoon. May I trouble you for a moment?",
  "str_quest_chat_20062002": "Good afternoon, Jane! How can I help you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20062003": "I was just in the kitchen, and noticed there isn't any food suitable for bird consumption.",
  "str_quest_chat_20062004": "I made an inquiry with the Fireflies, but they didn't seem to understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_20062005": "Would you care to report on whether this Colossus' food stores include anything fit for birds?",
  "str_quest_chat_20062006": "Uh... Maybe Dove knows more about it than I do?",
  "str_quest_chat_20062007": "I see. So she's also a resident of your Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_20062008": "Thank you for your time. Naturally, I will be making a record of our conversation, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_20063001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20063002": "If you had a very hectic morning, how would you spend your afternoon break?",
  "str_quest_chat_20063003": "Napping",
  "str_quest_chat_20063004": "I'd take the time to nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_20063005": "Exercising",
  "str_quest_chat_20063006": "I'd do a little exercise to charge up for the rest of the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20063007": "And such are the choices the Caelestite would make in these hypothetical situations...",
  "str_quest_chat_20063008": "I've taken note of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20063009": "Goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat_20063010": "... Still the Jane I know.",
  "str_quest_chat_20064001": "Could you thank your Fireflies for me?",
  "str_quest_chat_20064002": "Hmm, why?",
  "str_quest_chat_20064003": "I dropped my briefcase by accident.",
  "str_quest_chat_20064004": "All the files fell out.",
  "str_quest_chat_20064005": "They helped me pick them up.",
  "str_quest_chat_20064006": "I see. It's really not a big deal to them.",
  "str_quest_chat_20064007": "It's a big deal to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_20064008": "Anyway, please thank them.",
  "str_quest_chat_20064009": "Have a great afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20064010": "You too, Jane.",
  "str_quest_chat_20081001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_20081002": "Good evening, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_20081003": "... An untimely response? How uncharacteristic of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20081004": "Jane! Good evening! Sorry, I was a little busy just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20081005": "Not a problem. What were you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_20081006": "I... I was listening to a ghost story...",
  "str_quest_chat_20081007": "And I was wrapped up tightly in my blanket, so I wasn't able to answer at my terminal right away.",
  "str_quest_chat_20081008": "Understood... Another thing worth noting down. Caelestites are afraid of ghost stories.",
  "str_quest_chat_20081009": "Now then, good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20081010": "Please don't write that down!",
  "str_quest_chat_20082001": "I've noticed you don't tend to do any late-night snacking.",
  "str_quest_chat_20082002": "Ahahaha... You're right! It's true!",
  "str_quest_chat_20082003": "Is it because the snacks aboard the Colossus are not to your liking, or because you are over your standard body weight?",
  "str_quest_chat_20082004": "... Why does it have to be one of those two reasons?!",
  "str_quest_chat_20082005": "Judging by your lifestyle, as well as your past and current habits, it is safe to say that you are not a particularly self-disciplined person.",
  "str_quest_chat_20082006": "That's... brutally honest of you, Jane...",
  "str_quest_chat_20082007": "Only because, as a witness, my job is to record the facts in their fullest and most honest state.",
  "str_quest_chat_20082008": "Okay... Well, if you want to know the truth...",
  "str_quest_chat_20082009": "It's because I have trouble sleeping if I have snacks at night...",
  "str_quest_chat_20082010": "Insomnia caused by late-night snacking... Could this be a personal trait, or a common trait amongst the Caelestites? Either way, I must record it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20082011": "... Alright, that's enough! I'm going to bed now... Good night, Jane!",
  "str_quest_chat_20082012": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20083001": "Do you always write stuff at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_20083002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_20083003": "Sometimes...",
  "str_quest_chat_20083004": "But how did you know I write at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_20083005": "Vice told me that sometimes she'd see planned schedules in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_20083006": "I'd say, it's a good habit.",
  "str_quest_chat_20083007": "It really is easier to concentrate and write things at night... Sort things out and reflect.",
  "str_quest_chat_20083008": "Please keep it up.",
  "str_quest_chat_20101001": "Come over to the cafe!",
  "str_quest_chat_20101002": "Sure, I want to grab a coffee, anyway",
  "str_quest_chat_20101003": "I'm afraid you probably won't get a chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_20101004": "I'm busy right now",
  "str_quest_chat_20101005": "Drop whatever you got. This is more important!",
  "str_quest_chat_20101006": "Something bad happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_20101007": "Not really, nothing some explaining wouldn't fix.",
  "str_quest_chat_20101008": "I just think you're the best person for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20101009": "I can't believe someone would doubt my credibility and integrity.",
  "str_quest_chat_20101010": "What exactly happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_20101011": "Hold on, more people are coming.",
  "str_quest_chat_20151001": "Morning, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_20151002": "Morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_20151003": "Living life on the Colossus without a decent rival... I've gotta say, it's really boring!",
  "str_quest_chat_20151004": "Is it really that boring?",
  "str_quest_chat_20151005": "How about we hold a little contest?",
  "str_quest_chat_20151006": "Ah, Boss... You don't have to...",
  "str_quest_chat_20151007": "It'd be bad luck for someone to die on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_20151008": "After all, I can barely control my strength!",
  "str_quest_chat_20161001": "Good afternoon, boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_20161002": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_20161003": "You're always so full of energy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20161004": "Haha, I'm always preparing for a potential battle, after all!",
  "str_quest_chat_20161005": "Why do you say so?",
  "str_quest_chat_20161006": "Unless... there's danger lurking on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_20161007": "No, what I mean is that life can be unpredictable...",
  "str_quest_chat_20161008": "Who knows, I might meet an opponent in the near future who's so powerful that I can't help but want to fight them!",
  "str_quest_chat_20161009": "These are the moments I'm preparing for!",
  "str_quest_chat_20161010": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_20181001": "Good evening, Boss!",
  "str_quest_chat_20181002": "I'm fuming today!",
  "str_quest_chat_20181003": "What's up, Seleucid?",
  "str_quest_chat_20181004": "The snotty kids in Umbraton had the nerve to ask me how I usually bathe!",
  "str_quest_chat_20181005": "I've actually been a little curious about that myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_20181006": "Boss... how could you be like them?",
  "str_quest_chat_20181007": "That needs to be asked?",
  "str_quest_chat_20181008": "Right? I was thinking the same thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_20181009": "How did you respond?",
  "str_quest_chat_20181010": "I told them to read more books.",
  "str_quest_chat_20181011": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_20181012": "I bathe normally! How else do you bathe?!",
  "str_quest_chat_20181013": "Why aren't they curious about how those with tails or fluffy ears bathe?",
  "str_quest_chat_20181014": "Oh, forget it. I'm going to shower now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20181015": "Well... don't take it to heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_20201001": "How's your training coming along these days?",
  "str_quest_chat_20201002": "It's going well. I have it all planned out, with clear goals and everything.",
  "str_quest_chat_20201003": "Goals... I'm sure you know, but I used to work in logistics before becoming a manager later on.",
  "str_quest_chat_20201004": "To be honest, I can't tell which I liked more...",
  "str_quest_chat_20201005": "But whether it was management or logistics, my goal was always to fight and win as much as possible!",
  "str_quest_chat_20201006": "What are your goals, then? To get stronger?",
  "str_quest_chat_20201007": "Do you think you've reached your goals?",
  "str_quest_chat_20201008": "I have, I suppose...",
  "str_quest_chat_20201009": "You suppose? Where's your self-confidence?",
  "str_quest_chat_20201010": "Maybe... I still have to try a little harder...",
  "str_quest_chat_20201011": "You're already trying very hard, from what I can tell.",
  "str_quest_chat_20201012": "I'm glad to see you leading the of Aurorians.",
  "str_quest_chat_20201013": "S-Stop it, you're embarrassing me...",
  "str_quest_chat_20201014": "I'm just telling you the truth. No need to be embarrassed by it!",
  "str_quest_chat_20201015": "You've earned it, after all. You're an outstanding young man!",
  "str_quest_chat_20201016": "I'll keep paying close attention to your actions, but don't forget: pride comes before the fall.",
  "str_quest_chat_20201017": "Understood!",
  "str_quest_chat_20201018": "Good! That's exactly what a master of logistics would say!",
  "str_quest_chat_20201019": "Sure, but... I don't have anything to do with logistics...",
  "str_quest_chat_20202001": "War is cruel...",
  "str_quest_chat_20202002": "I'm certain you've realized that much for yourself, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_20202003": "Yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat_20202004": "And at this level of decision-making, even a single mistake can be far more costly than you could ever imagine.",
  "str_quest_chat_20202005": "Ignoring those passionate emotions of youth is difficult. It was no different for me when I was young.",
  "str_quest_chat_20202006": "It wasn't until I paid a steep price that I came to understand this.",
  "str_quest_chat_20202007": "But listen to me prattle on about things like this. I'm sure you're losing interest in it now, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_20202008": "Not at all! I understand what you're talking about all too well.",
  "str_quest_chat_20202009": "I'll take your words to heart, believe me...",
  "str_quest_chat_20202010": "You'd do well to do so. It may just help you grow as a person.",
  "str_quest_chat_20202011": "It seems my mind has gone back to the events of that time...",
  "str_quest_chat_20202012": "But really, all I wanted to tell you is that I'm excited to see your growth.",
  "str_quest_chat_20202013": "I'll... I'll do my best!",
  "str_quest_chat_20202014": "Hmm. We must always strive to grow, so let's do our best.",
  "str_quest_chat_20203001": "Let me ask you a question.",
  "str_quest_chat_20203002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_20203003": "What is something that a veteran sees and hears but is not necessarily limited to his sight and hearing?",
  "str_quest_chat_20203004": "Is it... Some sort of secret, military thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_20203005": "Exactly. Did you know that Illumina reprinted their Military Principles of Illumina twenty-six times?",
  "str_quest_chat_20203006": "I happen to own all twenty-six versions of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20203007": "Back then I was looking for something to start a fire, so I could cook, I looked long and hard at the books I had on hand...",
  "str_quest_chat_20203008": "But instead of using these, I chose some other books for the fire.",
  "str_quest_chat_20203009": "The way you were talking just now...",
  "str_quest_chat_20203010": "For a second, I thought you really cherished your copies of Military Principles of Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat_20203011": "That's beside the point. Just listen to what I'm about to say.",
  "str_quest_chat_20203012": "Even though the key points in these books are exactly the same, but the revision part is worth noting!",
  "str_quest_chat_20203013": "In some newly-edited versions, some excerpts analyzed and reviewed those battles from across the ages. These details are worthy of further research.",
  "str_quest_chat_20203014": "Though my years in the military are far behind me, not once have I lost my passion for studying the arts of warfare.",
  "str_quest_chat_20203015": "But because of their significance, I feel that I must give them to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20203016": "Gram, you mean... You're giving them all to me?",
  "str_quest_chat_20203017": "Of course, I am! It's been so long since I've met a kindred soul like you!",
  "str_quest_chat_20203018": "I'm absolutely thrilled to start researching together!",
  "str_quest_chat_20203019": "Why don't we start with Standing Under the Scorching Sun, and the principles of standing at attention in the military? We can put it into practice, and advance our knowledge together!",
  "str_quest_chat_20203020": "Th... Thanks, Gram...",
  "str_quest_chat_20203021": "But I don't think we really need to put it into practice...",
  "str_quest_chat_20204001": "I heard you haven't had much of an appetite recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_20204002": "Right. I didn't eat anything this morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_20204003": "And I just drank a few sips of milk last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20204004": "Hmm... And do you feel lethargic and unable to concentrate on your duties?",
  "str_quest_chat_20204005": "How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_20204006": "The same thing happened to me before. Fortunately for you, I happen to have the cure for your ailment.",
  "str_quest_chat_20204007": "Come and find me on the bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_20204999": "Gram is waiting for you on the bridge. Go and find him.",
  "str_quest_chat_20241001": "Seeing as I'll be aboard your Colossus from now on, I think an introduction is in order.",
  "str_quest_chat_20241002": "I'm Gram, the transportation platform manager for Undercity #24.",
  "str_quest_chat_20241003": "I've heard much about you, but I never expected you to be so young! How remarkable!",
  "str_quest_chat_20241004": "Glad to have you on board, Mr. Gram!",
  "str_quest_chat_20241005": "No need to be so polite! You can just call me Gram.",
  "str_quest_chat_20241006": "Aside from physical training and researching the arts of warfare, I also have a keen interest in culinary arts.",
  "str_quest_chat_20241007": "I'm aware that you're a superb commander, and I look forward to discussing combat tactics and other subjects with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20241008": "I look forward to it, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_20242001": "Thank you for the gift.",
  "str_quest_chat_20242002": "My training has been paying off lately! I can clearly feel my power increasing!",
  "str_quest_chat_20242003": "No need to be polite, it's just a small gift. You've more than earned it by helping us in battle.",
  "str_quest_chat_20242004": "I know that Caelestites can use their abilities to empower other Aurorians...",
  "str_quest_chat_20242005": "That I can sense my own power growing so substantially must be the result of our training together!",
  "str_quest_chat_20242006": "This is... This is too much. I'm flattered.",
  "str_quest_chat_20242007": "Don't be embarrassed! You earned this!",
  "str_quest_chat_20242008": "Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_20242009": "I ought to thank you for my recent improvement, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_20242010": "Really? It seems like this old soldier is still good for something, after all!",
  "str_quest_chat_20242011": "Look! This is the true strength of our combined military power!",
  "str_quest_chat_20242012": "Together, we can do greater service to everyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_20242013": "Yeah!",
  "str_quest_chat_20251001": "Brother-in-arms.",
  "str_quest_chat_20251002": "A new beginning! Now let's get to work!",
  "str_quest_chat_20251003": "Oh, hey Gram...",
  "str_quest_chat_20251004": "Just woke up, eh?",
  "str_quest_chat_20251005": "Looks like you could learn a thing or two from me, after all!",
  "str_quest_chat_20251006": "Wake up earlier to study new recipes, and cook yourself a nutritious breakfast... Both are essential for maintaining good health.",
  "str_quest_chat_20251007": "I can be in charge of eating a nutritious breakfast...",
  "str_quest_chat_20251008": "Hey! I'm up already, Gram!",
  "str_quest_chat_20252001": "Morning! Sleep well last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_20252002": "I just finished my morning jog.",
  "str_quest_chat_20252003": "That's quite a healthy lifestyle...",
  "str_quest_chat_20252004": "Early in the morning, the ingredients are sparkling with dew, such freshness, making them more irresistible...",
  "str_quest_chat_20252005": "Huh? You mean, you wake up early... just for food?",
  "str_quest_chat_20252006": "Not JUST for food.",
  "str_quest_chat_20252007": "I get exercise while I'm out looking for ingredients, too. Now that's killing two birds with one scone!",
  "str_quest_chat_20252008": "You might need to stop thinking of food. It's killing two birds with one stone...",
  "str_quest_chat_20253001": "Morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_20253002": "...What, no response?",
  "str_quest_chat_20253003": "Hum. Kids these days sure know how to sleep in...",
  "str_quest_chat_20253004": "When you get to be my age, you'll learn the meaning of insomnia.",
  "str_quest_chat_20253005": "But I feel better when I stay in a clear mind...",
  "str_quest_chat_20253006": "M... Morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_20253007": "Morning! Finally awake, eh?",
  "str_quest_chat_20253008": "Ahaha...",
  "str_quest_chat_20253009": "You don't really have to add finally to that...",
  "str_quest_chat_20261001": "As a once-proud military cook, I must tell you that it's lunchtime.",
  "str_quest_chat_20261002": "A military cook is responsible for providing his fellow soldiers with nutritious, energy-packed meals. It's not an easy job, let me tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20261003": "Uh... Thanks for the heads-up. I'm sure it wasn't easy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20261004": "Hmm, glad you understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_20261005": "Everyone thinks military cooks are only in charge of making food.",
  "str_quest_chat_20261006": "The truth is, their work has a massive impact on an army's morale.",
  "str_quest_chat_20261007": "I'll be sending my newest dish up to your room. I promise, the spice will get your blood pumping!",
  "str_quest_chat_20261008": "It is guaranteed to feel energized and aggravated! A perfect pre-combat meal!",
  "str_quest_chat_20261009": "Th-That won't be necessary, thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_20262001": "Speaking from a professional standpoint, lunchtime should take no longer than 30 minutes!",
  "str_quest_chat_20262002": "I don't think I can do it...",
  "str_quest_chat_20262003": "I've heard people say that eating lunch shouldn't take longer than half an hour...",
  "str_quest_chat_20262004": "But I eat pretty quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_20262005": "A fast eater, huh? Sounds like me, when I was your age!",
  "str_quest_chat_20262006": "But eating too quickly isn't good for your body, you know? The best practice is to chew slowly, eat lots of whole grains, and control your time spent eating.",
  "str_quest_chat_20262007": "Spending too much time eating your lunch makes it easier for you to feel tired in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20262008": "I remember falling asleep right next to a boiler because of that... Thinking back, that could have been a huge disaster.",
  "str_quest_chat_20262009": "Sounds like you were just sleepy from being full...",
  "str_quest_chat_20262010": "Ah, so you have some understanding of this stuff, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263002": "I-I'm here!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263003": "Not loud enough!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263004": "How can you tell the volume of my words via text?!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263005": "Respond again!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263006": "Agh... He- Here!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263007": "Here!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263008": "Good, that's the spirit!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263009": "It's almost lunchtime, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_20263010": "If you don't hurry up, all the food's gonna be gone!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263011": "Then go ahead and go eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_20263012": "Make sure to eat well, and eat lots.",
  "str_quest_chat_20263013": "Then you'll have the stamina you need for your training in the afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_20263014": "There's still more training?!",
  "str_quest_chat_20281001": "If you ask me, you look pretty energetic when you're giving commands.",
  "str_quest_chat_20281002": "Hey, thanks! I think this is the first time you've ever complimented me.",
  "str_quest_chat_20281003": "Assuming that was a compliment...",
  "str_quest_chat_20281004": "It was, but don't let it get to your head. You still have lots of room for growth!",
  "str_quest_chat_20281005": "Here's advice from an old soldier.",
  "str_quest_chat_20281006": "Remember to do a bit of light exercise before bed, like push-ups.",
  "str_quest_chat_20281007": "Exercise is the best way to keep yourself in good health, you hear me? Exercise!",
  "str_quest_chat_20281008": "Bear that in your mind, developing good habits in life!",
  "str_quest_chat_20281009": "Alright Gram, I get it!",
  "str_quest_chat_20281010": "In that case, get a good night's rest!",
  "str_quest_chat_20281011": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_20282001": "A good night's sleep is the best way to guarantee a great start to the next day.",
  "str_quest_chat_20282002": "But I heard you haven't been getting much rest lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_20282003": "Good evening, Gram! I was just getting ready to call it a day, actually.",
  "str_quest_chat_20282004": "Good to hear! Your body needs rest after a hard day's work, so don't stay up later than necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat_20282005": "I know people want to release themselves from the stress...",
  "str_quest_chat_20282006": "But don't even think that escaping from reality would do any good!",
  "str_quest_chat_20282007": "By the way, I noticed there's a bar on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_20282008": "But I'm sure you haven't developed any bad habits, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_20282009": "Not at all, Gram. I'd never do that, I promise.",
  "str_quest_chat_20282010": "Fantastic! Now off to bed with you! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_20282011": "Yes, sir! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_20301001": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_20301002": "Inspecting the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_20301003": "Can I come too?",
  "str_quest_chat_20301004": "Sure, I'm on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_20301005": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_20301006": "What's the matter? Are you bored?",
  "str_quest_chat_20301007": "Yeah, I think so.",
  "str_quest_chat_20301008": "So... any bright ideas to get rid of your boredom?",
  "str_quest_chat_20301009": "Well, yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_20301010": "We're chatting, aren't we?",
  "str_quest_chat_20302001": "Off to inspect the Colossus again, you are?",
  "str_quest_chat_20302002": "Yeah. It's my job.",
  "str_quest_chat_20302003": "Seems like you're working all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_20302004": "Not really... I was planning on going a little later...",
  "str_quest_chat_20302005": "Looks like this is a set routine for you every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_20302006": "That's why I took the liberty of doing your inspection for you today, I did.",
  "str_quest_chat_20302007": "The Colossus' Fireflies are all hard at work now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20302008": "The lift has been activated 87 times.",
  "str_quest_chat_20302009": "People have been through the Bridge, 4 of them, coming and going.",
  "str_quest_chat_20302010": "Everything is running normal, they do.",
  "str_quest_chat_20302011": "Please hang out with me for a bit, you can.",
  "str_quest_chat_20302012": "Th-That's amazing, Revy!",
  "str_quest_chat_20302013": "So what do you want to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_20302014": "I want to fight.",
  "str_quest_chat_20302015": "...That's not allowed on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_20341001": "Here come I am!",
  "str_quest_chat_20341002": "Super-strong I am, and I'm Revy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20341003": "That pilot guy, make sure you have a place to store my weapon! You do!",
  "str_quest_chat_20341004": "I... I think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_20341005": "Cool.",
  "str_quest_chat_20341006": "A bunch of strange people onboard, I heard.",
  "str_quest_chat_20341007": "Wonder who's stronger, me or them?",
  "str_quest_chat_20341008": "If you think they're stronger, where can I go to find out once and for all?",
  "str_quest_chat_20341009": "Alter-Blade is the best to kill Eclipsites and look cool, it is! Have you seen it before?",
  "str_quest_chat_20341010": "You're stronger! And the main thing is that...",
  "str_quest_chat_20341011": "We do not start any fights in or on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_20342001": "Making that clicking noise again, my sword...",
  "str_quest_chat_20342002": "That means it's gotten even stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_20342003": "I mean, it was already strong to begin with.",
  "str_quest_chat_20342004": "So when's the next battle? I can't wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_20342005": "I actually wish I could fight a little less...",
  "str_quest_chat_20342006": "Scared, you are?",
  "str_quest_chat_20342007": "No, I just think fighting is so painful. It always is...",
  "str_quest_chat_20342008": "Fight more or fight less, it doesn't matter. Don't be scared, here I am, getting stronger!",
  "str_quest_chat_20342009": "Also, I can protect you, I will!",
  "str_quest_chat_20342010": "Not just me, but everyone who needs protection.",
  "str_quest_chat_20342011": "Then, protect everyone who needs protection, like you said...",
  "str_quest_chat_20342012": "Now, try a few rounds, let me!",
  "str_quest_chat_20342013": "...Like I've also said, no fighting allowed on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_20343001": "I've gotten even stronger, for sure, I have!",
  "str_quest_chat_20343002": "I like to go to the front line! Smash the enemies down, I can!",
  "str_quest_chat_20343003": "But following your commands isn't all that bad, either...",
  "str_quest_chat_20343004": "What a shame, we can't charge at the enemy together.",
  "str_quest_chat_20343005": "If you had a choice to command from afar or lead the charge, which would you choose?",
  "str_quest_chat_20343006": "I think I'd still prefer commanding from the rear.",
  "str_quest_chat_20343007": "That way, I can assess the battlefield more clearly, and help everyone out.",
  "str_quest_chat_20343008": "I'd choose to charge right in...",
  "str_quest_chat_20343009": "I have never experienced that kind of freeing feeling of defeating the enemy with my own hands.",
  "str_quest_chat_20343010": "What about you, Revy? Would you ever want to command from the sidelines?",
  "str_quest_chat_20343011": "Nah. Lead the charge, always! I was born to it, I am!",
  "str_quest_chat_20343012": "Not to mention, I've gotten stronger than ever!",
  "str_quest_chat_20343013": "Can we fight now? Just want to show you my power, I do!",
  "str_quest_chat_20343014": "Not a chance! Don't even think about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_20351001": "The alarm went off this morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_20351002": "So I shut it off.",
  "str_quest_chat_20351003": "M-Morning, Revy...",
  "str_quest_chat_20351004": "Is that why you were late?",
  "str_quest_chat_20351005": "Yep! And after that, I hid the alarm clock.",
  "str_quest_chat_20351006": "That way, I have an excuse for the lateness.",
  "str_quest_chat_20351007": "Only 23 minutes late! Not bad, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_20351008": "It's something, I guess...",
  "str_quest_chat_20352001": "Morning. Hungry. Need food.",
  "str_quest_chat_20352002": "Morning. You haven't eaten breakfast yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_20352003": "Streamlining speech, and practicing action description, I am.",
  "str_quest_chat_20352004": "Seeing you. I should say good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_20352005": "If hungry. Eat spicy snacks.",
  "str_quest_chat_20352006": "That's... a little too streamlined.",
  "str_quest_chat_20361001": "Eat lunch at the right time!",
  "str_quest_chat_20361002": "Working on another plan, Revy?",
  "str_quest_chat_20361003": "Yep! I'm a good soldier, I am. So I look towards the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_20361004": "So where is this coming from?",
  "str_quest_chat_20361005": "You haven't eaten lunch, have you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20361006": "Not yet, no.",
  "str_quest_chat_20361007": "Prepare to eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_20361008": "You haven't grabbed your lunch yet, have you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20361009": "H-How'd you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_20361010": "I accidentally dropped mine on the floor earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_20361011": "So I ate yours, I did.",
  "str_quest_chat_20361012": "All gone!",
  "str_quest_chat_20361013": "...Why do I feel so hungry, all of a sudden...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20362001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20362002": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20362003": "Just now, a very desert-style dish, I tried. It hit the spot!",
  "str_quest_chat_20362004": "Oh? That's nice, Revy...",
  "str_quest_chat_20362005": "Jealous? Wanna try a bite?",
  "str_quest_chat_20362006": "It's called Spicy Sandworm Surprise, or something like that...",
  "str_quest_chat_20362007": "I-Is that so...? Thanks, but I think I'll pass...",
  "str_quest_chat_20362008": "What a pity.",
  "str_quest_chat_20363001": "Afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20363002": "For the last few days, my cooking was insanely good, I did.",
  "str_quest_chat_20363003": "After dealing with a few failed experiments, a true master chef I am now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20363004": "What kind of experiments?",
  "str_quest_chat_20363005": "Colossus specialty: homemade spicy set!",
  "str_quest_chat_20363006": "Only three bottles of different spicy-flavoring in one set!",
  "str_quest_chat_20363007": "Wanna try it? It'll blow your mind, I promise.",
  "str_quest_chat_20363008": "A-Actually, I'm feeling really full right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_20363009": "Fine, next time then.",
  "str_quest_chat_20364001": "It's noon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20364002": "Good afternoon, Revy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20364003": "Hungry again?",
  "str_quest_chat_20364004": "Can you read my mind?!",
  "str_quest_chat_20364005": "I've spent so much time with you, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_20364006": "And I'm hungry myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_20364007": "Yep, I'm about to go get some food.",
  "str_quest_chat_20364008": "Eating on time and resting regularly will make me stronger!",
  "str_quest_chat_20381001": "Off to bed. Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_20381002": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20381003": "Why are you still up?",
  "str_quest_chat_20381004": "I was just getting ready to go to bed when I replied to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20381005": "Why are you still up?",
  "str_quest_chat_20381006": "...Because I was replying to your last message!",
  "str_quest_chat_20381007": "I'm getting ready for bed now!",
  "str_quest_chat_20381008": "Why are you still up?",
  "str_quest_chat_20381009": "I'm not replying to that. Good night, Revy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20382001": "You asleep yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_20382002": "Almost.",
  "str_quest_chat_20382003": "Still working.",
  "str_quest_chat_20382004": "Oh. In that case, I'm going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_20382005": "...I thought you needed something.",
  "str_quest_chat_20382006": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_20382007": "I simply wanted to know Caelestite's daily routine, I did.",
  "str_quest_chat_20382008": "Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_20382009": "...Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_20401001": "What is your greatest aspiration, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20401002": "That's a pretty deep question, Allura.",
  "str_quest_chat_20401003": "I suppose it's to bring peace to the world as soon as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_20401004": "An answer befitting a Caelestite, as expected.",
  "str_quest_chat_20401005": "My dream has always been to make even more money, collect even more antiques, and do something I truly enjoy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20401006": "But recently, I came across something even greater than my own desires.",
  "str_quest_chat_20401007": "What on earth could that be, I wonder?",
  "str_quest_chat_20401008": "The Colossi.",
  "str_quest_chat_20401009": "I know that I could never have my own Colossus. However, if I look at things differently...",
  "str_quest_chat_20401010": "Living aboard a Colossus is just as good as owning one, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_20401011": "Hmm... I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat_20401012": "I'm glad you see things my way, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402001": "Are you there, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20402002": "Yeah, I'm here.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402003": "Is there something so important to you that you would break the rules just to see it done?",
  "str_quest_chat_20402004": "Let me think...",
  "str_quest_chat_20402005": "It feels like I've been broken the rules plenty of times...",
  "str_quest_chat_20402006": "Sometimes, when I need to make money quickly, I accept some very dubious jobs.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402007": "Obviously, those jobs aren't the kind of thing you want others to know about. Most people would say it's not legitimate.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402008": "Do you... think it's wrong of me to do that?",
  "str_quest_chat_20402009": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402010": "That's because I think your ultimate goal is pure, Allura.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402011": "Yep.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402012": "Especially if the jobs are too dangerous.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402013": "But I think all those jobs have one point in common...",
  "str_quest_chat_20402014": "They're all taken with the goal of acquiring more antiques for your collection, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_20402015": "Hmm... Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402016": "I'm glad you see it that way.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402017": "I may ask you more questions like this in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402018": "It seems that some matters can only be resolved by hearing your answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_20402019": "That's fine, Allura.",
  "str_quest_chat_20441001": "My aim is even sharper than before.",
  "str_quest_chat_20441002": "Whether it's picking a target or picking an antique, I'm getting more precise.",
  "str_quest_chat_20441003": "Thank you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20441004": "Don't be so polite. I'm only doing what's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_20441005": "I suppose I could charge you less for my work in the future...",
  "str_quest_chat_20441006": "As my way of saying thanks, I'll set up an exhibition room here on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_20441007": "There are so many nice things on this Colossus... you should really take better care of them.",
  "str_quest_chat_20441008": "Once the room is complete, I'll name the items as Caelestite Selects.",
  "str_quest_chat_20441009": "Once that day comes, we can hold the first-ever Colossus Auction! It'll be great!",
  "str_quest_chat_20441010": "What do you think, Navigator? Not a bad idea, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_20441011": "Thanks, Allura...",
  "str_quest_chat_20441012": "But I don't plan on holding any auctions on the Colossus anytime soon...",
  "str_quest_chat_20441013": "What a shame...",
  "str_quest_chat_20441014": "It seems I'll have to complete even more tasks to repay you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20441015": "Allura sure has a strange way of repaying...",
  "str_quest_chat_20461001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20461002": "Good afternoon, Allura.",
  "str_quest_chat_20461003": "What did you have for lunch today?",
  "str_quest_chat_20461004": "Just the usual box lunch. I'm not very picky when it comes to food.",
  "str_quest_chat_20461005": "I see. An unsurprising choice.",
  "str_quest_chat_20461006": "Alright, bye for now. I'm off to find inspiration for lunch. Maybe the others will have better responses.",
  "str_quest_chat_20461007": "Do you really need inspiration to choose your lunch...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20462001": "What are you doing this afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_20462002": "Hmm... Taking a break, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat_20462003": "You have that much free time on your hands?",
  "str_quest_chat_20462004": "Why don't you help me practice my sniper skill instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_20462005": "It's simple, really. All you need to do is put an apple on your head...",
  "str_quest_chat_20462006": "Then I just aim and fire...",
  "str_quest_chat_20462007": "Ahahaha... About that...",
  "str_quest_chat_20462008": "Actually, something just came up this afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_20462009": "Talk to you later, Allura!",
  "str_quest_chat_20481001": "Evening time is the best time to go shopping.",
  "str_quest_chat_20481002": "Especially in Umbraton. All sorts of surprises are bound to appear after the sun sets.",
  "str_quest_chat_20481003": "Like what?",
  "str_quest_chat_20481004": "Like... Good night, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20481005": "Huh? But you haven't finished telling me!",
  "str_quest_chat_20481006": "That's right, but I just wanted to say good night, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat_20481007": "That and to show you my latest merchandise.",
  "str_quest_chat_20481008": "That's right! For just a few Nightium, you can buy this unexpected Umbraton antique...",
  "str_quest_chat_20481009": "You'll think about it, won't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20481010": "You definitely weren't just saying good night, Allura...",
  "str_quest_chat_20482001": "Good evening. This is the time I usually get to work.",
  "str_quest_chat_20482002": "But it's already so late...",
  "str_quest_chat_20482003": "There is no specific timeframe for my tasks.",
  "str_quest_chat_20482004": "For example, my task today is to check on you and make sure the Navigator goes to bed at a reasonable time.",
  "str_quest_chat_20482005": "Seeing as the Navigator is, in fact, still awake, my work here is more or less done.",
  "str_quest_chat_20482006": "I'll take my pay now, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20482007": "You really worked hard, didn't you, Allura?",
  "str_quest_chat_20482008": "That makes no sense! I never made a task like that...!",
  "str_quest_chat_20482009": "I know, I was just giving an example.",
  "str_quest_chat_20482010": "But if I find you awake this late at night next time, I'll definitely demand pay.",
  "str_quest_chat_20482011": "Okay... Good night, Allura.",
  "str_quest_chat_20483001": "Real antique shines brightly, even in the darkness of night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20483002": "You mean... gemstones?",
  "str_quest_chat_20483003": "Yes, but gemstones are only one kind of antique.",
  "str_quest_chat_20483004": "If wealth can make a person feel satisfied at heart, one can say that wealth is an antique of its own, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_20483005": "That makes sense...",
  "str_quest_chat_20483006": "Good night, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20483007": "Good night, Allura.",
  "str_quest_chat_20484001": "You're still up, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20484002": "Are you looking for collectibles too?",
  "str_quest_chat_20484003": "No... how should I put it...",
  "str_quest_chat_20484004": "I just got dragged into playing video games by a bunch of people...",
  "str_quest_chat_20484005": "As a result, I missed bedtime and now I'm completely awake!",
  "str_quest_chat_20484006": "So games bring you satisfaction, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20484007": "Perhaps we can call that a kind of collectible.",
  "str_quest_chat_20484008": "Games can be really satisfying.",
  "str_quest_chat_20484009": "But... good games should be played with others.",
  "str_quest_chat_20484010": "It makes things more fun.",
  "str_quest_chat_20484011": "Is that so...",
  "str_quest_chat_20485001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_20485002": "Evening, Allura.",
  "str_quest_chat_20485003": "All is still now, and the constant sound of the pocket watch is particularly clear.",
  "str_quest_chat_20485004": "Err... Doesn't that sound a little hypnotic?",
  "str_quest_chat_20485005": "Hypnotic? No, not hypnotic.",
  "str_quest_chat_20485006": "Sounds like this only remind me of one thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_20485007": "Time is money, and we need to make money now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20485008": "Now that's a telling answer if I've ever heard one.",
  "str_quest_chat_20501001": "What'cha doing, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20501002": "Just doing some reading.",
  "str_quest_chat_20501003": "You're so hardworking, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20501004": "Why not take a bweak and chat with me for a while?",
  "str_quest_chat_20501005": "Just resting for a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat_20501006": "Then it's a gwear time to chat with me!",
  "str_quest_chat_20501007": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_20501008": "Did you open the package I brots you earlier, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20501009": "Yeah, there was a bottle of water inside.",
  "str_quest_chat_20501010": "That's not ordinawy water, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_20501011": "That's hot spwing water from my hometown, like I pwomised!",
  "str_quest_chat_20501012": "But one bottle... Isn't really enough for a bath, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_20501013": "But it's not for bathing, it's for drinking!",
  "str_quest_chat_20501014": "A Cloud Mountain specialty: hot spwing water that can drink!",
  "str_quest_chat_20501015": "That's amazing! But...",
  "str_quest_chat_20501016": "It smells kind of funny...",
  "str_quest_chat_20501017": "Huh? Don't tell me it alweady went bad...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20501018": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_20501019": "I'll bwing you a few more bottles next time, and I'll make sure they're fresh too!",
  "str_quest_chat_20501020": "You really don't have to, Tweety.",
  "str_quest_chat_20501021": "Nope! I said I'll do it, and that's that!",
  "str_quest_chat_20502001": "Navi-Navi-Naaaa-viiii-gatoooor!",
  "str_quest_chat_20502002": "What's wrong, Tweety?",
  "str_quest_chat_20502003": "I need hewp with something, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20502004": "Oh, yeah? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_20502005": "Well... It's weally something we should tawk about face to face.",
  "str_quest_chat_20502006": "Can you come and meets me in the cafe, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20502007": "I wiww be waiting for you there!",
  "str_quest_chat_20502999": "What could Tweety possibly wish to tell you? Quickly head to the cafe to find out.",
  "str_quest_chat_20551001": "The earwy bird gets the worm!",
  "str_quest_chat_20551002": "The earwy bird sends the word!",
  "str_quest_chat_20551003": "The lazy Navigator still looks a blur.",
  "str_quest_chat_20551004": "Good morning, Tweety.",
  "str_quest_chat_20551005": "I'm right here, you know...",
  "str_quest_chat_20551006": "Whoa! You're up, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20551007": "Why is that such a big surprise...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20552001": "Wake up, Navigator! Huwwy!",
  "str_quest_chat_20552002": "Tweety? It's so early... What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_20552003": "It's snowing outside!",
  "str_quest_chat_20552004": "We can build snowmen, throw snow balls!",
  "str_quest_chat_20552005": "Why don't I see any snow outside...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20552006": "Huh??? Where'd all the snow go...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20552007": "Was I dreaming it just now?",
  "str_quest_chat_20552008": "Maybe, if you go back to sleep, you'll make it just in time for the snowball fight in the dream...",
  "str_quest_chat_20552009": "Hey, you're right!",
  "str_quest_chat_20552010": "I'll go rest my feathers for a wittle longer now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20553001": "Navigator! Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20553002": "Navi-Navi-Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20553003": "Naaaa-viiii-gatoooor!!",
  "str_quest_chat_20553004": "G... Good morning, Tweety...",
  "str_quest_chat_20553005": "You're finally awake, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20553006": "And you're up awfully early...",
  "str_quest_chat_20553007": "Heehee! It's all a part of being a top-notch couwiwer!",
  "str_quest_chat_20553008": "This way, I can deliver everyone's mail even sooner!",
  "str_quest_chat_20553009": "Got any mail you need delivered today, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20553010": "I... don't think so.",
  "str_quest_chat_20554001": "Mornin', Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20554002": "Good morning, Tweety.",
  "str_quest_chat_20554003": "I didn't oversleep this time!",
  "str_quest_chat_20554004": "Yes! You got up vewy earwy!",
  "str_quest_chat_20554005": "Pwaise!",
  "str_quest_chat_20554006": "Hehe, don't underestimate me.",
  "str_quest_chat_20554007": "I'm capable of getting up even earlier!",
  "str_quest_chat_20554008": "Amazing, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20554009": "What would you wike to do now?",
  "str_quest_chat_20554010": "Let me think... there's nothing much to do so early in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_20554011": "Maybe I'll go back to sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_20561001": "Good afternoon, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20561002": "Good afternoon, Tweety. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_20561003": "Nothing much, weally...",
  "str_quest_chat_20561004": "Can I come and say hi if nothing happened, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20561005": "I suppose...",
  "str_quest_chat_20561006": "You don't sound happy... I'ww see myself out, then...",
  "str_quest_chat_20561007": "Tweety, you can find me anytime you like.",
  "str_quest_chat_20561008": "I always knew you were a nice guy, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20562001": "Time for afternoon bweak, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20562002": "Don't you need a break too, Tweety?",
  "str_quest_chat_20562003": "Nope! I will be delivewing mails after my lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat_20562004": "Sounds rough...",
  "str_quest_chat_20562005": "It's all part of the job! Heehee!",
  "str_quest_chat_20562006": "I gotta do my vewy best!",

  "str_quest_chat_20562008": "You do your best too, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20562009": "Sure, I'll get right on it! Right after lunch...",
  "str_quest_chat_20563001": "Oh, Naaaa-viiii-gatoooor!",
  "str_quest_chat_20563002": "Do you know how to make ice cweam?",
  "str_quest_chat_20563003": "Not really, no.",
  "str_quest_chat_20563004": "Well, I do!",
  "str_quest_chat_20563005": "Neat! So how do you make it?",
  "str_quest_chat_20563006": "It's simple!",
  "str_quest_chat_20563007": "Take a scoop of snow, then add some jam on top, and here is my fluffy ice cweam!",
  "str_quest_chat_20563008": "It tastes amazing, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_20563009": "Is that even ice cream?",
  "str_quest_chat_20563010": "Yeah! I'll make some for you next time, 'kay?",
  "str_quest_chat_20563011": "Th-Thanks, Tweety...",
  "str_quest_chat_20564001": "Is it noon aweady, Mr. Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20564002": "Mr. Navigator isn't still sweeping, is he?",
  "str_quest_chat_20564003": "Mr. Navigator, Mr. Navigator, are you awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_20564004": "Of course!!",
  "str_quest_chat_20564005": "I'm just a little slow in replying, that's all!",
  "str_quest_chat_20564006": "Oh oh, Tweety has mistaken Mr. Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20564007": "Well, then I'll continue dewivering my wetters!",
  "str_quest_chat_20564008": "Bye bye, Mr. Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20564009": "... Bye, Tweety.",
  "str_quest_chat_20581001": "Hey Navigator... You there?",
  "str_quest_chat_20581002": "Something wrong, Tweety?",
  "str_quest_chat_20581003": "You don't seem as cheery as you do during the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_20581004": "It's so dark at night...",
  "str_quest_chat_20581005": "Do you think scawy things are hiding evewywhere?",
  "str_quest_chat_20581006": "Are you afraid of the dark, Tweety?",
  "str_quest_chat_20581007": "It's okay. Here, close your eyes for a second.",
  "str_quest_chat_20581008": "Just imagine the day we had our snowball fight...",
  "str_quest_chat_20581009": "Wasn't that a fun day?",
  "str_quest_chat_20581010": "...Tweety?",
  "str_quest_chat_20581011": "Did she really fall asleep that quickly...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20582001": "I had a sweet dream last night!",
  "str_quest_chat_20582002": "I hope I can continue that dream when I go to sleep tonight, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_20582003": "What did you dream about?",
  "str_quest_chat_20582004": "I dreamt that I used all my hard-earned money...",
  "str_quest_chat_20582005": "And I build a big house for my family!",
  "str_quest_chat_20582006": "What a good kid you are, Tweety!",
  "str_quest_chat_20582007": "But you should really get to bed soon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20582008": "Okay! Good night, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_20582009": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_20582010": "Make sure to get lots of rest, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_20582011": "Will do! Sweet dreams!",
  "str_quest_chat_20583001": "Wow... It's alweady nighttime, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20583002": "That's right. The day went by really quickly, didn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_20583003": "Aren't you tired, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20583004": "A little bit, yeah. It was a full day of work today.",
  "str_quest_chat_20583005": "Someday I'll go back to Cloud Mountain and bwing you some water from the hot spwings.",
  "str_quest_chat_20583006": "Take a gweat bath, and you'll feel good as new afterwards!",
  "str_quest_chat_20583007": "That's a lot of water to carry...",
  "str_quest_chat_20584001": "Mr. Navigator, Mr. Navigator, are you sweeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_20584002": "If I'm sleeping, I wouldn't be answering you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20584003": "Oh oh! Mr. Navigator is weally awake!",
  "str_quest_chat_20584004": "Tweety just finished today's work!",
  "str_quest_chat_20584005": "Long day for you, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_20584006": "Of course, I'm twying to be the best female couwier ever!",
  "str_quest_chat_20584007": "Working hard is a must in order to catch up.",
  "str_quest_chat_20584008": "Well said! Your enthusiasm is catching, Tweety. Even I'm feeling more motivated now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20584009": "I'll get up earlier tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_20584010": "Hehe, Mr. Navigator's a hard worker, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601001": "Where do you go when you feel tired, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20601002": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_20601003": "Probably my room, to get some sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601004": "An effective method, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601005": "A healthy sleep can feel as refreshing as rain in the springtime.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601006": "Wash away your troubles and grant your mind a fresh start.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601007": "What about you, Naroxel? If I had to guess, then I would say...",
  "str_quest_chat_20601008": "You probably go for a walk in the nearby forest when you're feeling tired, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_20601009": "How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_20601010": "I remember you're rather fond of forests.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601011": "Not to mention, you usually take walks with Bessie.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601012": "You noticed that, and you remember.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601013": "You truly are a gentle and caring person.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601014": "I'm embarrassed, that's what I should do.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601015": "If you would like...",
  "str_quest_chat_20601016": "You are more than welcome to join us on our walks.",
  "str_quest_chat_20601017": "Okay!",
  "str_quest_chat_20602001": "Do you like music, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20602002": "Yeah, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat_20602003": "Why do you ask?",
  "str_quest_chat_20602004": "It's Olive and Palm.",
  "str_quest_chat_20602005": "They seem awfully eager to see you again.",
  "str_quest_chat_20602006": "They even said they want to sing a song for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20602007": "What kind of song?",
  "str_quest_chat_20602008": "Allow me to translate it for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20602009": "Oh, Navigator, gentle yet daring.",
  "str_quest_chat_20602010": "Oh, Navigator, confident yet caring.",
  "str_quest_chat_20602011": "From the very first glaring",
  "str_quest_chat_20602012": "Meet again is what we're requiring",
  "str_quest_chat_20602013": "I had no idea they liked me this much...",
  "str_quest_chat_20602014": "That's very sweet of them to sing the song, but it feels like something's off...",
  "str_quest_chat_20602015": "Perhaps my translation is not very accurate.",
  "str_quest_chat_20602016": "Next time, you must hear their song with your own ears to appreciate it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20602017": "I promise you will not be disappointed.",
  "str_quest_chat_20602018": "Alright, then. I'm actually looking forward to hearing it!",
  "str_quest_chat_20603001": "Navigator, your Colossus is truly magnificent.",
  "str_quest_chat_20603002": "I see you've also worked hard on the interior decoration of the rooms here.",
  "str_quest_chat_20603003": "Thank you, Naroxel.",
  "str_quest_chat_20603004": "But it's still not perfect.",
  "str_quest_chat_20603005": "What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_20603006": "It's too cluttered here.",
  "str_quest_chat_20603007": "If you don't mind, I can move some of these to the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat_20603008": "What are those!?",
  "str_quest_chat_20603009": "Take a look for yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_20603999": "Naroxel has invited you to the lounge to see what she has brought aboard with her.",
  "str_quest_chat_20641001": "Thank you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20641002": "What...? Why are you thanking me, all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_20641003": "I cannot explain it, but I feel...",
  "str_quest_chat_20641004": "I feel that my control of Lumina has improved significantly.",
  "str_quest_chat_20641005": "Ever since Her Majesty the Queen first showed me how to use Lumina...",
  "str_quest_chat_20641006": "I have not felt this kind of sensation for a very long time.",
  "str_quest_chat_20641007": "I believe you are responsible for this.",
  "str_quest_chat_20641008": "But I haven't really done anything...",
  "str_quest_chat_20641009": "I just lend a hand from time to time, that's all...",
  "str_quest_chat_20641010": "There is no need to be so humble, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20641011": "It is clear that you deeply cherish your allies.",
  "str_quest_chat_20641012": "You care for each and every one of us with all your heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_20641013": "Could it be... that you are nature's messenger?",
  "str_quest_chat_20641014": "I really don't think so...",
  "str_quest_chat_20641015": "I just want to make sure my friends are all healthy and safe.",
  "str_quest_chat_20641016": "I promise I will do everything in my power to realize this wish of yours.",
  "str_quest_chat_20651001": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20651002": "Are you awake yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_20651003": "Good morning, Naroxel.",
  "str_quest_chat_20651004": "Sorry, I'm still a little sleepy. I just woke up.",
  "str_quest_chat_20651005": "Really? Perhaps we should go out and collect some morning dew?",
  "str_quest_chat_20651006": "Morning... dew?",
  "str_quest_chat_20651007": "Indeed. Drinking some will give you energy for the entire day!",
  "str_quest_chat_20651008": "Really? In that case, I'll go get some right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_20661001": "Good afternoon! The weather sure is wonderful today.",
  "str_quest_chat_20661002": "No kidding! If you hadn't mentioned it, I probably wouldn't have noticed it at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_20661003": "Weather like this is perfect for taking a nice, long walk.",
  "str_quest_chat_20661004": "You and I are of the same mind, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_20661005": "Bessie and I are taking a stroll outside as we speak.",
  "str_quest_chat_20661006": "I think I'll do the same once I'm done with my work!",
  "str_quest_chat_20662001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20662002": "Half of this wonderful day has already passed us by.",
  "str_quest_chat_20662003": "Yeah... I'm pretty hungry now. Good thing it's almost lunchtime!",
  "str_quest_chat_20662004": "What are you having for lunch today?",
  "str_quest_chat_20662005": "I plan on gathering some wild fruit from the forest to eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_20662006": "...Just fruits? Is that enough for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20663001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20663002": "Good afternoon. Need something?",
  "str_quest_chat_20663003": "I was just thinking, you spend all of your time working so hard...",
  "str_quest_chat_20663004": "Does it make you feel dizzy or lightheaded at times?",
  "str_quest_chat_20663005": "It does, yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat_20663006": "It's not that bad...",
  "str_quest_chat_20663007": "Why not open a window, and let the scent of nature in?",
  "str_quest_chat_20663008": "Sure, I'll try that.",
  "str_quest_chat_20663009": "Wow... My head feels much clearer now!",
  "str_quest_chat_20664001": "Navigator, have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_20664002": "I picked some wild fruit and I'd like to share them with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20664003": "Ah, Naroxel, thank you for your kindness.",
  "str_quest_chat_20664004": "But I just finished eating and I'm not hungry yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_20664005": "Oh, what a pity.",
  "str_quest_chat_20664006": "Next time then, I will ask you in advance.",
  "str_quest_chat_20664007": "Deal!",
  "str_quest_chat_20664008": "May the scent of nature be with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20665001": "Good afternoon, Mr. Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20665002": "Afternoon, Naroxel.",
  "str_quest_chat_20665003": "Would you care to have lunch this afternoon in the bosom of nature?",
  "str_quest_chat_20665004": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_20665005": "Then, please make your way to the Bridge now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20665006": "Hmm... Maybe a little later.",
  "str_quest_chat_20665007": "Understood. When you feel up to leaving your room, just head straight to the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_20665008": "Right now, the subtle ebb and flow of the wind is simply enchanting.",
  "str_quest_chat_20665009": "If you don't know how to appreciate it, you'll be missing out on one of nature's best gifts.",
  "str_quest_chat_20681001": "Night will fall soon... And all will return to darkness.",
  "str_quest_chat_20681002": "You are not very fond of the night?",
  "str_quest_chat_20681003": "The night is just another aspect of nature.",
  "str_quest_chat_20681004": "As such, I could never resent it. How about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20681005": "I...",
  "str_quest_chat_20681006": "Is something the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_20681007": "My mind brought up images of the Eclipsites just now...",
  "str_quest_chat_20681008": "Even though the vast majority of them lurk under the cover of night...",
  "str_quest_chat_20681009": "But those monsters aren't a part of nature at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_20681010": "I don't dislike it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20681011": "Sometimes, I feel a quiet night...",
  "str_quest_chat_20681012": "Makes it easier for me to think through things calmly and clearly.",
  "str_quest_chat_20681013": "I respect your view very much.",
  "str_quest_chat_20681014": "But it is indeed very late now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20681015": "Thinking about things too much at this hour will affect your sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_20681016": "Let us close our eyes and rest our minds for tonight. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20681017": "Yeah, good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20701001": "Excuse me, but what's your understanding of the word faith?",
  "str_quest_chat_20701002": "Faith? I prefer to put it as hope.",
  "str_quest_chat_20701003": "It's something that supports a person to keep going, with determination.",
  "str_quest_chat_20701004": "That's exactly how I thought about it before.",
  "str_quest_chat_20701005": "So you don't feel the same about it anymore?",
  "str_quest_chat_20701006": "I still do, it's just...",
  "str_quest_chat_20701007": "It's just...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20701008": "If one puts faith in the wrong things from the very beginning...",
  "str_quest_chat_20701009": "Doesn't that make a person's determination nothing more than a joke?",
  "str_quest_chat_20701010": "You have a point...",
  "str_quest_chat_20701011": "Have you ever thought of where people's faith comes from?",
  "str_quest_chat_20701012": "It's a personal choice, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_20701013": "Just as naive as I used to be, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_20701014": "You actually think faith is the result of a personal choice.",
  "str_quest_chat_20701015": "So it's something people force on each other?",
  "str_quest_chat_20701016": "You're absolutely correct.",
  "str_quest_chat_20701017": "But... But I still believe in it!",
  "str_quest_chat_20701018": "I believe a person can choose their own faith freely.",
  "str_quest_chat_20701019": "Oh? Then I wish you the best of luck.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702001": "Have you ever seen a bramble bloom?",
  "str_quest_chat_20702002": "I didn't know brambles could even bloom...",
  "str_quest_chat_20702003": "Of course they do. Their flowers are my favorite.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702004": "The most beautiful, delicate existence surrounded by countless, painful thorns.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702005": "It possesses the most unbridled, powerful soul.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702006": "Your description gives me a déjà vu...",
  "str_quest_chat_20702007": "People often say the brambles represent the suffering of fate.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702008": "Do you agree?",
  "str_quest_chat_20702009": "I don't agree.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702010": "I think the bramble flower chooses to bloom among the thorns.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702011": "It proves to the world that it likes and accepts the thorns, and isn't afraid of suffering.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702012": "I can't help but feel admiration towards it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702013": "Maybe.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702014": "To live a life surrounded by thorns, you have to be even more careful than everyone else.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702015": "But I really do admire the bramble flower.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702016": "Even in such a dangerous environment, it still has the courage to bloom.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702017": "I'm glad you feel that way.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702018": "You know, you resemble a flower that blooms among thorns too, Paloma.",
  "str_quest_chat_20702019": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_20702020": "Oh, I sure hope that wasn't a compliment.",
  "str_quest_chat_20703001": "Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20703002": "Have you finished reading the book we discussed last time?",
  "str_quest_chat_20703003": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_20703004": "But I've read most of it!",
  "str_quest_chat_20703005": "I've finished it!",
  "str_quest_chat_20703006": "But there were some parts I didn't understand...",
  "str_quest_chat_20703007": "It seems you're ready to share your thoughts.",
  "str_quest_chat_20703008": "Meet me in the cafe, and we'll talk further.",
  "str_quest_chat_20703999": "Something seems to be on Paloma's mind... Head to the cafe and check out on her.",
  "str_quest_chat_20741001": "Hello, Navigator. My name is Paloma.",
  "str_quest_chat_20741002": "Nice to meet you, Paloma. Welcome aboard.",
  "str_quest_chat_20741003": "Oh? I wasn't expecting your response to be so... average.",
  "str_quest_chat_20741004": "But since I'm welcome aboard...",
  "str_quest_chat_20741005": "Would you like to know more about the thorns in my hand?",
  "str_quest_chat_20741006": "Uh... N-Not if you don't feel like sharing...",
  "str_quest_chat_20741007": "I was just saying what I usually say to new recruits.",
  "str_quest_chat_20741008": "So if you said it without even thinking... Does that mean you weren't being sincere?",
  "str_quest_chat_20741009": "Maybe you aren't aware of this yet, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_20741010": "If there's anything in the world that I hate, it's insincerity.",
  "str_quest_chat_20741011": "Why do I feel like I'm just digging myself deeper into a hole...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20741012": "Anyway, it's a real pleasure to meet you, Paloma.",
  "str_quest_chat_20741013": "If there's anything I can help you with...",
  "str_quest_chat_20741014": "I'll try my best to do so!",
  "str_quest_chat_20741015": "Oh? Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_20742001": "Have you seen my coin, by any chance?",
  "str_quest_chat_20742002": "Why? Did you misplace it? How much is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_20742003": "I can help you look for it if you want?",
  "str_quest_chat_20742004": "Are you joking? I wouldn't wear Nightium as a necklace...",
  "str_quest_chat_20742005": "Oh! So you were talking about the coin hanging around your neck...",
  "str_quest_chat_20742006": "Yeah, I noticed it before. It's unique!",
  "str_quest_chat_20742007": "Oh? You think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_20742008": "It used to be a symbol of the Temple of Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_20742009": "But later, it got stained by the blood on my palm...",
  "str_quest_chat_20742010": "The design on the symbol changed soon after that.",
  "str_quest_chat_20742011": "Then... is your hand okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_20742012": "Of course it is, this happened a long time ago. It's just...",
  "str_quest_chat_20742013": "The coin seems to have changed again recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_20742014": "I assume it has something to do with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20742015": "I didn't do anything, I swear!",
  "str_quest_chat_20742016": "Oh, relax. I just wanted to tell you, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat_20742017": "The coin has brought me stronger power.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743001": "You saw that girl with the short hair, didn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20743002": "S-Sorry, I didn't mean to...",
  "str_quest_chat_20743003": "Don't worry, I wasn't blaming you for anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743004": "Can I ask you... how did she look like?",
  "str_quest_chat_20743005": "Yeah, I can do that, no problem!",
  "str_quest_chat_20743006": "She had blonde, shoulder-length hair.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743007": "Her eyes were closed, and she had a faint smile on her face...",
  "str_quest_chat_20743008": "It seemed as though she was deep in prayer.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743009": "She was quiet and elegant.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743010": "Do you think she was happy?",
  "str_quest_chat_20743011": "I do. She looked really happy to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743012": "I could tell from seeing her expression.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743013": "That may not have been the case.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743014": "It's not easy to judge a person's real emotions from their appearance.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743015": "Who was that girl?",
  "str_quest_chat_20743016": "Oh? Who do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_20743017": "Well, you two look similar somehow.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743018": "So, I'd say... she's your sister?",
  "str_quest_chat_20743019": "Wrong answer, sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat_20743020": "Don't tell me... she's your daughter?!",
  "str_quest_chat_20743021": "What?! You really have a wild imagination, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20743022": "So... It's your past self?",
  "str_quest_chat_20743023": "Is it that hard to believe?",
  "str_quest_chat_20743024": "It really was you?!",
  "str_quest_chat_20751001": "Bad morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20751002": "Bad morning? Don't you mean good morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_20751003": "Who says every morning must be a good one?",
  "str_quest_chat_20751004": "Well, I'm sure most people pray that every morning is a good one, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_20751005": "Pray...? And just who do they pray to?",
  "str_quest_chat_20751006": "Praying doesn't do a thing. The only person who can help you is yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_20751007": "In that case... I'll personally make every morning a good one for myself!",
  "str_quest_chat_20751008": "Oh... Then you should probably get out of bed now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20761001": "It's already past noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20761002": "Though I suppose most people prefer the morning over the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20761003": "Why do you say that?",
  "str_quest_chat_20761004": "Well, there's that saying: an hour in the morning is worth two in the evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_20761005": "Do you believe in that, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20761006": "I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_20761007": "Ah, so you do believe these kinds of sayings.",
  "str_quest_chat_20761008": "So you're the kind that plans out your entire day in the mornings, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_20761009": "I don't.",
  "str_quest_chat_20761010": "Huh. Never took you for the rebellious type.",
  "str_quest_chat_20761011": "So when do you usually lay out your plans for the day?",
  "str_quest_chat_20761012": "I...",
  "str_quest_chat_20761013": "I was just about to do that!",
  "str_quest_chat_20781001": "It's late... Haven't you finished your work yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_20781002": "Not yet, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_20781003": "Poor Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20781004": "Why do you work so hard, anyways?",
  "str_quest_chat_20781005": "It's... to realize my dream.",
  "str_quest_chat_20781006": "Oh, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_20781007": "I guess dreams are the best motivation.",
  "str_quest_chat_20781008": "It's... for our survival.",
  "str_quest_chat_20781009": "Oh, I see. Everyone wants to stay alive...",
  "str_quest_chat_20781010": "In the end, we're all risking our lives just to survive.",
  "str_quest_chat_20781011": "It's too late for deep, philosophical thoughts... I think I'll get back to work now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20782001": "You should sleep, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20782002": "You're right. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20782003": "Hmm... this is a silent night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20782004": "Yeah... It's pretty quiet.",
  "str_quest_chat_20782005": "Still not asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_20782006": "It's too quiet... Kind of makes it harder to fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_20782007": "Oh? Feeling guilty, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20782008": "Such as you said good night, but you're still awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_20782009": "I didn't do it on purpose. I've just got a lot on my mind, is all...",
  "str_quest_chat_20782010": "Sometimes thinking isn't the way to find the answer you're looking for.",
  "str_quest_chat_20782011": "Just close your eyes, and get some sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_20782012": "Sure... Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20783001": "It's getting late. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20783002": "Good night. Hope you have pleasant dreams tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_20783003": "Oh? And I hope you sleep a dreamless sleep tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_20783004": "You don't like dreaming?",
  "str_quest_chat_20783005": "Dreams drag people back to their pasts. Back to their pain...",
  "str_quest_chat_20783006": "O-Oh, I'm sorry. In that case...",
  "str_quest_chat_20783007": "I hope you have a dreamless sleep, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_20783008": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20784001": "I keep thinking, if the God of Light created everything...",
  "str_quest_chat_20784002": "Why would he create the night as a foil to the light?",
  "str_quest_chat_20784003": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_20784004": "It's okay, just say what's on your mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_20784005": "Maybe the God of Light wasn't the one who created everything?",
  "str_quest_chat_20784006": "Oh? Then who did?",
  "str_quest_chat_20784007": "I...",
  "str_quest_chat_20784008": "You think YOU'RE the god of all creation?",
  "str_quest_chat_20784009": "I was going to say, I don't know!",
  "str_quest_chat_20784010": "Anyway, does this world really have a god of creation?",
  "str_quest_chat_20784011": "Hmm, you brought up an entirely-new question.",
  "str_quest_chat_20784012": "Maybe you'll find the answer to that question yourself, someday?",
  "str_quest_chat_20784013": "I... I'll try!",
  "str_quest_chat_20785001": "It's late again.",
  "str_quest_chat_20785002": "I notice you're really active at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20785003": "Oh? Is that the impression I've given you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20785004": "Am I wrong...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20785005": "No, you're perfectly right.",
  "str_quest_chat_20785006": "The Truth is begotten by silence and the night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20785007": "And late-night thoughts tend to be clearer, and more precise.",
  "str_quest_chat_20785008": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_20785009": "Of course, assuming you aren't feeling drowsy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20785010": "I don't think I'm up for any late-night thinking tonight... Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20785011": "Good night, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20786001": "The night is dark, but you have not returned to the embrace of sleep, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20786002": "I just... wanted to slack off a bit...",
  "str_quest_chat_20786003": "There's no time for gaming during the day, so I have to play at night...",
  "str_quest_chat_20786004": "You can't resist gaming even though it cuts into your rest time...",
  "str_quest_chat_20786005": "Don't tell Vice about this!",
  "str_quest_chat_20786006": "Or she'll take my console away...",
  "str_quest_chat_20786007": "I don't have a habit of depriving others of their hobbies.",
  "str_quest_chat_20786008": "Even if it might be meaningless, entertainment is a necessity for life.",
  "str_quest_chat_20786009": "Exactly, Paloma. Go on and get some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_20786010": "I'll sleep when I complete this chapter of the game.",
  "str_quest_chat_20786011": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20787001": "On such an obstructed night, the god of light will not hear any prayer, no matter how hard you try.",
  "str_quest_chat_20787002": "Maybe gods keep work hours, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_20787003": "What do you rely on when you find yourself in difficulties, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_20787004": "I'd rely on myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_20787005": "It could be very tough...",
  "str_quest_chat_20787006": "But sometimes doing it yourself is the only way to grow.",
  "str_quest_chat_20787007": "I'd count on my friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_20787008": "If it's something I couldn't solve alone, I'd look for help.",
  "str_quest_chat_20787009": "It's easier to tackle it with friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_20787010": "Is that your answer?",
  "str_quest_chat_20787011": "That does fit your style.",
  "str_quest_chat_20801001": "Tell me—do right and wrong exist in business?",
  "str_quest_chat_20801002": "Must we really discuss such a difficult topic?",
  "str_quest_chat_20801003": "The guild lost a substantial amount of money today.",
  "str_quest_chat_20801004": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_20801005": "It was at the hands of those crooks.",
  "str_quest_chat_20801006": "My adoptive father says I am too idealistic. He's right. He's always right.",
  "str_quest_chat_20801007": "But I think it is important to be idealistic!",
  "str_quest_chat_20801008": "It's rare for you to take a stand on such an issue... But do you really understand what I mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_20801009": "Haha... To tell the truth, I don't quite understand... Your words are always very... abstract.",
  "str_quest_chat_20801010": "I just think the word idealistic is somehow... romantic.",
  "str_quest_chat_20801011": "I think it suits you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20801012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_20801013": "Oh, sorry... I didn't mean anything by it...",
  "str_quest_chat_20801014": "No... What you said just now was quite appropriate.",
  "str_quest_chat_20801015": "I see that you can be very comforting at times.",
  "str_quest_chat_20802001": "Let me ask you this—have you ever been in love?",
  "str_quest_chat_20802002": "Erm...",
  "str_quest_chat_20802003": "That's right. In love.",
  "str_quest_chat_20802004": "Uh... Love, huh...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20802005": "Well... No, I haven't...",
  "str_quest_chat_20802006": "Hmm... I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_20802007": "Well, there was this one time...",
  "str_quest_chat_20802008": "Of course you haven't. I can tell.",
  "str_quest_chat_20802009": "You could tell!?",
  "str_quest_chat_20802010": "Well.. I did live alone for 17 years, so...",
  "str_quest_chat_20802011": "I fully understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_20802012": "Why did you ask me this?",
  "str_quest_chat_20802013": "There's this character in a book I read. I couldn't understand his feelings, so I wanted to ask someone about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20802014": "But you don't seem to understand, either. I should probably ask someone else.",
  "str_quest_chat_20841001": "Nice to meet you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20841002": "Nice to meet you, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_20841003": "My name is Bethel. I would like to make a deal with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20841004": "With me? I really don't have anything to sell to you...",
  "str_quest_chat_20841005": "Of course you do. You possess relics of an ancient civilization—relics every guild in the land would like to get their hands on.",
  "str_quest_chat_20841006": "But I guarantee that I can offer you the highest price.",
  "str_quest_chat_20841007": "Do you mean Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_20841008": "He's strictly not for sale!",
  "str_quest_chat_20841009": "Oh, really? I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_20841010": "That is a shame. A transaction requires both parties to be in agreement, so I will not force you to do something you're opposed to.",
  "str_quest_chat_20841011": "However, I have heard that the Colossus possesses a consciousness of its own. May I talk to him?",
  "str_quest_chat_20841012": "Sure, I can make that happen. What would you like to talk to him about?",
  "str_quest_chat_20841013": "Since you don't want to sell me the Colossus, I'll ask him if he wishes to sell you to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_20841014": "Wait... Sell me!?",
  "str_quest_chat_20841015": "I jest.",
  "str_quest_chat_20841016": "Did you hope I was serious?",
  "str_quest_chat_20842001": "Are you afraid of me?",
  "str_quest_chat_20842002": "Why would I be afraid of you? And why would you even say that!?",
  "str_quest_chat_20842003": "I remember when I was a child... Everyone saw me as a monster because of my horns and tail.",
  "str_quest_chat_20842004": "For a time, I believed them. I put on my cloak and lived my life in shame and solitude.",
  "str_quest_chat_20842005": "But after my adoptive father sent me to Lumopolis, I discovered that those who truly stood in the light treated me with kindness.",
  "str_quest_chat_20842006": "That's because you're not a monster, Bethel.",
  "str_quest_chat_20842007": "I know that now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20842008": "The true monsters lie within those people's hearts.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843001": "Another rainy day...",
  "str_quest_chat_20843002": "The weather has been just awful, recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843003": "Hmm. This kind of weather always complicates my mood.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843004": "I'm guessing you don't like cloudy days...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20843005": "It's not that I don't like them, it's just...",
  "str_quest_chat_20843006": "Did something happen in the past?",
  "str_quest_chat_20843007": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843008": "Since I was very young, whenever I cried, dark clouds would gather in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843009": "Over time, the image of the darkened sky became imprinted in my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843010": "As soon as I see a cloudy day, I unconsciously feel like crying.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843011": "Hmm... I think I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843012": "But then, something changed my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843013": "Because of that one time, they were born from those dark clouds.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843014": "You mean Frankel?",
  "str_quest_chat_20843015": "Yes. They were originally the hero's pet in my favorite novel, but came to me when I was at my lowest.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843016": "After that, I didn't hate cloudy days so much.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843017": "Each story has its highs and lows, and each character has their strengths and weaknesses. I believe that this concept can be applied in many aspects of life.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843018": "Right. Cloudy days can also be a good thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_20843019": "See that cloud? Doesn't it look like Frankel?",
  "str_quest_chat_20843020": "Yes. It's beautiful.",
  "str_quest_chat_20851001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_20851002": "Good morning, Bethel.",
  "str_quest_chat_20851003": "I have a full schedule today.",
  "str_quest_chat_20851004": "Really? It seems you're really busy every day. It can't be easy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20851005": "But I still have enough time to have breakfast with someone.",
  "str_quest_chat_20851006": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_20851007": "I'm inviting you to breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_20851008": "Oh! Alright!",
  "str_quest_chat_20852001": "I'm reading a book on market economy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20852002": "The interpretation of resource allocation outlined in the book is interesting. I highly recommend that you read it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20852003": "Bethel...",
  "str_quest_chat_20852004": "I just got up. My brain can't handle this right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_20852005": "That's not a problem. When you calculate the value of futures, you're sure to perk up.",
  "str_quest_chat_20852006": "I doubt it! Besides, what does the value of futures even mean!?",
  "str_quest_chat_20861001": "Do you often drink coffee in the afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_20861002": "Only when I feel sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20861003": "Then I'd like to recommend the Holiday Café to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20861004": "The coffee there is different from anywhere else. It has a warm flavor.",
  "str_quest_chat_20861005": "Huh? But I like iced coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat_20861006": "You... Never mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_20862001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20862002": "Good afternoon, Bethel. What have you been up to recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_20862003": "I just wrapped up some negotiations yesterday and signed four contracts.",
  "str_quest_chat_20862004": "After that, I checked the guild warehouse and made a new set of logistics plans.",
  "str_quest_chat_20862005": "I also took care of various menial tasks, such as accounting...",
  "str_quest_chat_20862006": "All in all, nothing too strenuous. How about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20862007": "Erm...",
  "str_quest_chat_20862008": "I've just finished my breakfast. Now I'm getting ready for lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_20862009": "Well, that... that could also be considered a fulfilling life, in a way.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863001": "Have you traveled to many places?",
  "str_quest_chat_20863002": "Well... after activating Soroz, we've been to many places.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863003": "The Rediesel Desert, Illumina, Lumopolis... and even Eraveil.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863004": "With a Colossus at your disposal, you can easily go anywhere you please.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863005": "I really envy you. I grew up living in the same place—the longest distance I've ever traveled is from the ground to the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863006": "Perhaps that is why my understanding of the world is also vertical—I arrange things in a column under the light of the sun.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863007": "The places closest to the sun are bright and beautiful, while the shadows beyond the sun's reach are mere breeding grounds for decay.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863008": "But I haven't seen the world from a horizontal perspective.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863009": "If you ever get a spare moment, we should go for a trip sometime, Bethel!",
  "str_quest_chat_20863010": "You are right about Soroz, he's indeed amazing, we can go anywhere.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863011": "Hah... What are you talking about? I'm a very busy person.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863012": "I didn't mean what I said.",
  "str_quest_chat_20863013": "The sun is too strong this afternoon... I'm feeling a little dizzy.",
  "str_quest_chat_20864001": "Have you finished reading the book I lent you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20864002": "Every time I want to talk to you about books, you have nothing to contribute.",
  "str_quest_chat_20864003": "That book was too complex. I... I can't understand it at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_20864004": "I don't think that's the problem. It's just that you don't know how to calm your mind and immerse yourself in the text.",
  "str_quest_chat_20864005": "Is... is that so? I thought we discussed quite a number of books before!",
  "str_quest_chat_20864006": "You cannot simply nod like a woodpecker and call that a discussion.",
  "str_quest_chat_20864007": "I'm sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat_20864008": "Fine. What kind of books do you like to read?",
  "str_quest_chat_20864009": "Erm... I like simple, straightforward adventure stories.",
  "str_quest_chat_20864010": "Adventure... Okay, I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_20864011": "I'll talk to you about some adventure novels tomorrow. Please be prepared.",
  "str_quest_chat_20865001": "What do you think of me?",
  "str_quest_chat_20865002": "Why... are you suddenly asking?",
  "str_quest_chat_20865003": "I want to write a novel lately. The protagonist is a girl who pilots a huge machine...",
  "str_quest_chat_20865004": "I want to write a story about her and her friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_20865005": "I don't have any experience piloting a huge machine, so I'm not sure how to create the character...",
  "str_quest_chat_20865006": "So here I am.",
  "str_quest_chat_20865007": "But... I'm not a girl.",
  "str_quest_chat_20865008": "Good point... Alright! How about I change it to a guy!?",
  "str_quest_chat_20865009": "A story about a boy who pilots a huge machine and surrounds by a bunch of guys...",
  "str_quest_chat_20865010": "That... doesn't sound too good.",
  "str_quest_chat_20865011": "I wonder how many would enjoy it...",
  "str_quest_chat_20865012": "How about... a different take?",
  "str_quest_chat_20865013": "A female protagonist who's the daughter of a calculative merchant...",
  "str_quest_chat_20865014": "She can't make a choice between the male lead and the other boys...",
  "str_quest_chat_20865015": "That would be a good story! I'll go work on the plot now! Later!",
  "str_quest_chat_20865016": "Oh... See you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20866001": "Navigator, have you seen my books?",
  "str_quest_chat_20866002": "What books?",
  "str_quest_chat_20866003": "The books I put on the shelves a few days ago...",
  "str_quest_chat_20866004": "The Returned Princess of Lumopolis, My Wild Northland Bodyguard, The Love of Illumina's Hunk General...",
  "str_quest_chat_20866005": "And the... Umbraton Sexy, The Mystery Order's Charming Youngster...",
  "str_quest_chat_20866006": "Probably a few dozen...",
  "str_quest_chat_20866007": "Probably... they've all been moved to your room.",
  "str_quest_chat_20866008": "Since you're the only one who reads books like that...",
  "str_quest_chat_20881001": "Another day has passed.",
  "str_quest_chat_20881002": "I like this time very much. At the end of the day, there is no need to work under the pressure of time constraints.",
  "str_quest_chat_20881003": "The world slows down after the sunsets.",
  "str_quest_chat_20881004": "Really? I feel that as soon as it's time to rest, time passes very quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_20881005": "It seems I can never get enough rest...",
  "str_quest_chat_20881006": "Hah... You sound so pitiful.",
  "str_quest_chat_20881007": "Well, I'll come and spend some more time with you in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_20881008": "Our diverging perceptions of time may result in balance.",
  "str_quest_chat_20881009": "I suppose that makes sense...",
  "str_quest_chat_20881010": "You can thank me later.",
  "str_quest_chat_20901001": "I painted a picture for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_20901002": "Huh? Why?!",
  "str_quest_chat_20901003": "It's just something I do. Yesterday, you happened to be the subject of my artwork.",
  "str_quest_chat_20901004": "Allow me to give it to you. I'm pretty confident in my paintings—they're very popular in Umbraton, at least.",
  "str_quest_chat_20901005": "But... why do I need a painting of myself?",
  "str_quest_chat_20901006": "To hang by your bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_20901007": "It just seems a little strange... Thanks, but no.",
  "str_quest_chat_20901008": "Fine, then. I'll hang it up in the office.",
  "str_quest_chat_20901009": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_20901010": "Give it to me! Thank you for your lovely gift!",
  "str_quest_chat_20902001": "Navigator, I won't be able to join you on the journey we previously agreed upon.",
  "str_quest_chat_20902002": "Oh... Don't worry about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20902003": "But it's not like you to break plans. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_20902004": "One of my mercenaries was injured. I need to visit him in the hospital.",
  "str_quest_chat_20902005": "I'm afraid I'll be unavailable until he has completely recovered.",
  "str_quest_chat_20902006": "I see... It almost seems like you are a parent to the White Flame Mercenaries.",
  "str_quest_chat_20902007": "It's nothing like that. I'm just trying my best to be considerate...",
  "str_quest_chat_20902008": "You really do care a lot about other people.",
  "str_quest_chat_20902009": "Hmm, but I'm still not perfect in this regard...",
  "str_quest_chat_20902010": "You seem pretty great to me!",
  "str_quest_chat_20902011": "I hope your mercenary gets better soon!",
  "str_quest_chat_20902012": "Well, I thank you, on his behalf.",
  "str_quest_chat_20903001": "Navigator, I can't understand it!",
  "str_quest_chat_20903002": "Why are insect specimens allowed in this world?",
  "str_quest_chat_20903003": "Erm... You mean when people collect insect specimens as... decorations?",
  "str_quest_chat_20903004": "Who in their right mind would consider a corpse to be a decoration!?",
  "str_quest_chat_20903005": "When you say it like that, it does sound rather revolting...",
  "str_quest_chat_20903006": "The White Flame Mercenaries will not tolerate such evil deeds!",
  "str_quest_chat_20903007": "From tomorrow on, Umbraton will never again be home to such specimens.",
  "str_quest_chat_20903008": "Okay, as long as you keep the noise down...",
  "str_quest_chat_20904001": "Navigator, would you like to come and visit me?",
  "str_quest_chat_20904002": "Erm... You mean, in Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat_20904003": "Yes, to visit the White Flame Mercenaries, to be precise.",
  "str_quest_chat_20904004": "I'd like to invite you to see our headquarters for yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_20904005": "But... I've actually been to Umbraton before.",
  "str_quest_chat_20904006": "Are you saying you wouldn't like to return?",
  "str_quest_chat_20904007": "I assure you that the White Flame Mercenaries headquarters are very different from anything you've seen before.",
  "str_quest_chat_20904008": "Well... I'm not too busy right now, so I suppose I can go and take a look.",
  "str_quest_chat_20904009": "Great! I'll come and get you!",
  "str_quest_chat_20904999": "Luke invites you to visit the White Flame Mercenaries... What is so special about their headquarters? It's time to go and find out!",
  "str_quest_chat_20941001": "Hello, I'm Luke, Commander of the White Flame Mercenaries.",
  "str_quest_chat_20941002": "Hi, nice to meet you! My name is PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_20941003": "If you have any problems that need taking care of, you can entrust them to us.",
  "str_quest_chat_20941004": "The White Flame Mercenaries charge a reasonable fee, but our services are first-class.",
  "str_quest_chat_20941005": "I don't think I need any mercenary-related services right now... But, can you help me with some grocery shopping?",
  "str_quest_chat_20941006": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_20941007": "I will take this as a joke, and not an insult... for now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20941008": "It was a joke, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_20941009": "Well, I hope we will have something about business to discuss next time we meet.",
  "str_quest_chat_20942001": "I have heard that the residents of Lumopolis often confess their sins.",
  "str_quest_chat_20942002": "Can such confession really bring forgiveness to them?",
  "str_quest_chat_20942003": "Why would you ask me that?",
  "str_quest_chat_20942004": "Surely you don't have any sins to confess, Luke. You're such a kind and trustworthy person.",
  "str_quest_chat_20942005": "You think so highly of me, but I'm not so innocent.",
  "str_quest_chat_20942006": "Being a mercenary in Umbraton is like crawling in the dirtiest mud.",
  "str_quest_chat_20942007": "It's been hard not to get stuck and swallow by it, but it's impossible to keep your hands clean.",
  "str_quest_chat_20942008": "At least you still despise those corruptions, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_20942009": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_20942010": "Then you don't have to confess to anyone, as you have already confessed to yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_20942011": "Confessed to myself?",
  "str_quest_chat_20942012": "Thank you. I will remember these words.",
  "str_quest_chat_20951001": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_20951002": "Good morning, Luke. You get up so early every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_20951003": "As they say, the early bird catches the worm.",
  "str_quest_chat_20951004": "With such a terrifying proverb always on my mind, how could I possibly dare to sleep in?",
  "str_quest_chat_20951005": "Terrifying...?",
  "str_quest_chat_20961001": "My butterfly tells me that this is lunchtime.",
  "str_quest_chat_20961002": "You needed a butterfly to tell you that?",
  "str_quest_chat_20961003": "They have this invention now that's even more practical than a butterfly. It's called a watch.",
  "str_quest_chat_20961004": "Mechanical structures lack nature's beauty.",
  "str_quest_chat_20961005": "Besides, insects can tell me other things, such as... it will rain later.",
  "str_quest_chat_20961006": "Alright, I take it back—a butterfly sounds a lot more practical!",
  "str_quest_chat_20962001": "I always feel so sleepy in the afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_20962002": "Maybe I'm sick? Perhaps I should go to the hospital.",
  "str_quest_chat_20962003": "Everyone gets sleepy, Luke.",
  "str_quest_chat_20962004": "But that's no excuse, not for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_20962005": "You're just tired. It's your body's way of reminding you to rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_20962006": "I can't rest, at least not for now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20962007": "You're stretching yourself too thin. Relax a little.",
  "str_quest_chat_20962008": "I have a lot to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_20962009": "I want to expand the White Flame Mercenaries...",
  "str_quest_chat_20962010": "I want to be... like him...",
  "str_quest_chat_20962011": "Have a good rest, Luke.",
  "str_quest_chat_20963001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_20963002": "Afternoon, Luke!",
  "str_quest_chat_20963003": "I stumbled upon my notebook from seven years ago today...",
  "str_quest_chat_20963004": "Looking back at my paintings back then, I couldn't help but feel embarassed.",
  "str_quest_chat_20963005": "Ohh, was that how you felt about them?",
  "str_quest_chat_20963006": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_20963007": "This whole painting thing... It really does take quite a lot of practice.",
  "str_quest_chat_20963008": "But then again, maybe that's true of everything in life.",
  "str_quest_chat_20963009": "I couldn't agree more.",
  "str_quest_chat_20981001": "The night is falling. You should raise your vigilance.",
  "str_quest_chat_20981002": "You make it sound like such a big deal... It's just the night!",
  "str_quest_chat_20981003": "Many things are hidden in the darkness.",
  "str_quest_chat_20981004": "It could be someone who wishes you ill, or perhaps a hungry beast.",
  "str_quest_chat_20981005": "Don't worry, Luke. We don't have these things aboard Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_20981006": "Or pesky insects. Like mosquitoes...",
  "str_quest_chat_20981007": "Well, that's certainly something to be careful of!",
  "str_quest_chat_20982001": "I saw a dried-up earthworm just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_20982002": "What is your opinion on death?",
  "str_quest_chat_20982003": "Well... it's something very sad.",
  "str_quest_chat_20982004": "Whether it is someone close to us or not, it's always sad.",
  "str_quest_chat_20982005": "Indeed. I know it is a part of life, but in this instance, I am the only one who witnessed it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20982006": "Luke, you...",
  "str_quest_chat_20982007": "Say no more. I must be off. I will paint a picture for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20983001": "Navigator, would you like to come to the bar with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_20983002": "The drinks are on me.",
  "str_quest_chat_20983003": "Why the sudden generosity?",
  "str_quest_chat_20983004": "After completing today's mission, the mercenary squad decided a celebration was in order.",
  "str_quest_chat_20983005": "We generally don't save much money. The way of the White Flame Mercenaries is to enjoy the money we earn while we still can.",
  "str_quest_chat_20983006": "So, basically... it would be my pleasure.",
  "str_quest_chat_20983007": "Thanks for the offer, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_20983008": "I'm only seventeen... I can't drink yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_20984001": "Are you still awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_20984002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_20984003": "I've been losing sleep recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_20984004": "Whenever I go to bed, I just can't stop thinking.",
  "str_quest_chat_20984005": "What would you think about?",
  "str_quest_chat_20984006": "People always say that I'm becoming more and more like the old commander.",
  "str_quest_chat_20984007": "Sure enough, I'm following in his footsteps, but... I don't want to replace him.",
  "str_quest_chat_20984008": "Have things not been going well in your mercenary squad recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_20984009": "That's not it... In fact, it's getting better all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_20984010": "But the more we grow, the more I feel overcome by this irrational sense of panic... Can I really realize the ambitions that the old commander failed to achieve?",
  "str_quest_chat_20984011": "Erm... To be honest, I'm not good with this kind of complicated thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_20984012": "But if you can't sleep, I may have a solution for you. Have you tried counting sheep?",
  "str_quest_chat_20984013": "Counting sheep? Why would I count sheep? What do sheep have to do with me not being able to sleep!?",
  "str_quest_chat_20984014": "Erm... Then count butterflies! Imagine a bunch of butterflies in front of you, and count them one by one!",
  "str_quest_chat_20984015": "There are 52 butterflies before my eyes. I can count them in a single glance. How will this help me to sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_20984016": "Sorry, forget what I just said. I don't know how you can get more sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_20985001": "Did you see the painting I sent to your room?",
  "str_quest_chat_20985002": "Oh! The one that looks like puffy, dancing butterflies?",
  "str_quest_chat_20985003": "Is that a new species?",
  "str_quest_chat_20985004": "No! It's a sketch of the fireflies!",
  "str_quest_chat_20985005": "Inspiration hit me at dinner, so I jumped on it.",
  "str_quest_chat_20985006": "The way they fly... really resemble butterflies.",
  "str_quest_chat_20985007": "What if they're dressed up like butterflies?",
  "str_quest_chat_20985008": "Don't! Please! It's gonna affect their work!",
  "str_quest_chat_20985009": "Oh... How unfortunate.",
  "str_quest_chat_20986001": "Tonight is a good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_20986002": "Huh? What brought that on?",
  "str_quest_chat_20986003": "I had a look around Umbraton's commercial strip today...",
  "str_quest_chat_20986004": "The vendors were enthusiastically selling their goods, and passersby were also having a great time shopping.",
  "str_quest_chat_20986005": "Watching such a lively scene, I couldn't help but feel joy arising from within me.",
  "str_quest_chat_20986006": "So even now, even for a brief moment, thinking back to that scene makes me feel good.",
  "str_quest_chat_20986007": "It looks like your feelings for Umbraton runs deep.",
  "str_quest_chat_20986008": "Ahh... Speaking of this, I hope I made your day.",
  "str_quest_chat_20986009": "Please, rest early.",
  "str_quest_chat_20986010": "Alright, you too, Luke.",
  "str_quest_chat_20986011": "Goodnight, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_20986012": "Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_21001001": "Are you interested in my mechanical bones?",
  "str_quest_chat_21001002": "Erm... Well... No, not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_21001003": "But you always seem to be staring at my arm.",
  "str_quest_chat_21001004": "It's nothing. I mean, I don't think it's weird or anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_21001005": "Scars are a soldier's medals of honor. They make sure that we do not forget the battles we've been through.",
  "str_quest_chat_21001006": "And they ensure that we won't forgive those who started the war.",
  "str_quest_chat_21001007": "Would it become a problem during the battle?",
  "str_quest_chat_21001008": "Arm wrestle me.",
  "str_quest_chat_21001009": "No, no, no! I know my limits!",
  "str_quest_chat_2100101": "Vice",
  "str_quest_chat_2100102": "Ms. Blanc",
  "str_quest_chat_2100103": "Sinsa",

  "str_quest_chat_21002001": "You have an exceptional psychic ability, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_21002002": "Yes... Is there anything I can do for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_21002003": "No, It's against the rules to use civilians to investigate a case. I'd never do such a thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_21002004": "Oh... Well... I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_21002005": "But I do think your talents are well-suited to tracking down sinners.",
  "str_quest_chat_21002006": "It is a shame that you are a civilian.",
  "str_quest_chat_21002007": "Have you ever considered becoming a judge? I can give you a recommendation.",
  "str_quest_chat_21002008": "Drop it, already!",
  "str_quest_chat_21003001": "Hello, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003002": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003003": "Can you do me a favor?",
  "str_quest_chat_21003004": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_21003005": "Maybe it's a little too inconvenient for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003006": "What is it? If I can help...",
  "str_quest_chat_21003007": "It'll be my pleasure!",
  "str_quest_chat_21003008": "This matter... We'd better talk about it in detail after meeting up.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003009": "I'll wait for you on the bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003051": "Thank you for helping me with this, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003052": "I didn't expect it was because of my eye sockets.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003053": "I don't think they were afraid of the Hall of Justice's work, just because of the dark circles under your eyes.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003054": "There must have been some kind of misunderstanding.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003055": "Right.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003056": "I'll go back to Dawn Academy and explain to the students in detail...",
  "str_quest_chat_21003057": "A day in the life of Judge Pittman!",
  "str_quest_chat_21003058": "Wait a minute... Are you going to tell the students all about your daily routine?",
  "str_quest_chat_21003059": "Of course, this allows them to quickly understand the work and lifestyle of the Hall of Justice member.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003060": "Is something wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_21003061": "N-No...",
  "str_quest_chat_21003062": "By the way, I left you with the sunglasses.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003063": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_21003064": "I saw you had dark circles under your eyes the last time we spoke.",
  "str_quest_chat_21003065": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_21003999": "Is Pittman asking for help? Go to the bridge and ask him what's going on.",
  "str_quest_chat_21041001": "I hate people who try to make it look like personal heroism is the greatest thing there is.",
  "str_quest_chat_21041002": "They only consider an individual point of view... It is foolish to preach hero-worship among the people!",
  "str_quest_chat_21041003": "You're really that opposed to individualistic heroism?",
  "str_quest_chat_21041004": "Yes. Because I have suffered at its hands.",
  "str_quest_chat_21041005": "Stories of the hero saved the day are more popular with the public.",
  "str_quest_chat_21041006": "Hmph... But this kind of thinking is harmful, especially regarding young people.",
  "str_quest_chat_21041007": "Ignoring orders and dreaming of being a hero, always wishing to change things by themselves alone.",
  "str_quest_chat_21041008": "How much power can a person possibly have? After all, more people will be required to clean up the mess caused by such recklessness.",
  "str_quest_chat_21041009": "Heroes can only bring chaos, whereas order can achieve justice.",
  "str_quest_chat_21041010": "Is that why you became a judge?",
  "str_quest_chat_21041011": "Yes. Do you agree with this conclusion?",
  "str_quest_chat_21041012": "It's a little extreme, but... I think it makes sense.",
  "str_quest_chat_21041013": "Good. I'll immediately propose to amend the law and delete the word hero from the dictionary!",
  "str_quest_chat_21041014": "Hey, that's more than a little extreme!",
  "str_quest_chat_21051001": "Morning.",

  "str_quest_chat_21052002": "You actually care about the weather, Wayne?",
  "str_quest_chat_21052003": "Yes. On sunny days, all are exposed to the sun's glory, while on rainy days, evil breeds unhindered.",
  "str_quest_chat_21052004": "On such days, one must be extra vigilant.",
  "str_quest_chat_21052005": "But rainy days are not all bad—they're great for farmers!",
  "str_quest_chat_21052006": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_21052007": "Your perspective is more optimistic than mine.",
  "str_quest_chat_21052008": "If you're not too busy being vigilant against evil, remember to bring an umbrella!",
  "str_quest_chat_21052009": "Thank you for reminding me...",
  "str_quest_chat_21052010": "I could learn something from your attitude toward life.",
  "str_quest_chat_21052011": "No, not at all! I was just speaking without thinking!",
  "str_quest_chat_21053001": "Do you know how I can stop myself from feeling so sleepy?",
  "str_quest_chat_21053002": "So, you feel sleepy too, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_21053003": "You can try to take a cup of coffee.",
  "str_quest_chat_21053004": "I see. Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21053005": "I'm working on a case, and I haven't had time to sleep these past three days.",
  "str_quest_chat_21053006": "I didn't foresee that I would be reduced to such a pitiful state...",
  "str_quest_chat_21053007": "You haven't slept for three days?! Get some rest, with your current status, drinking coffee wouldn't...",
  "str_quest_chat_21053008": "I need to hold on a little longer.",
  "str_quest_chat_21053009": "Lumopolis must execute its justice today.",
  "str_quest_chat_21054001": "I have a question that I wanted to ask since I got out of bed today.",
  "str_quest_chat_21054002": "Do you think there's order in Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat_21054003": "Some sort of...?",
  "str_quest_chat_21054004": "So what is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_21054005": "Money... Money is everything in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_21054006": "That's not order...",
  "str_quest_chat_21054007": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_21054008": "But why?",
  "str_quest_chat_21054009": "Some say commerce brought order to Umbraton...",
  "str_quest_chat_21054010": "Commerce is based on the flow of money, but money itself has nothing to do with order.",
  "str_quest_chat_21054011": "I think so too.",
  "str_quest_chat_21054012": "Money is material. It can't bring forth order.",
  "str_quest_chat_21054013": "In fact, it only brings chaos, or the so-called freedom by the people of Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_21054014": "But... does freedom without order really have meaning?",
  "str_quest_chat_21061001": "I'm having dinner.",
  "str_quest_chat_21061002": "The buttered bread of Lumopolis is delicious. I highly recommend it.",
  "str_quest_chat_21061003": "Thank you! I'll try it the next time I get the chance!",
  "str_quest_chat_21061004": "Come to Lumopolis and I will be your guide.",
  "str_quest_chat_21061005": "I think there is buttered bread in many other places. What's so special about the ones you get in Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_21061006": "I'll take you to try it when we're both free. You'll only know once you've eaten it yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_21061007": "Do judges get long lunch breaks?",
  "str_quest_chat_21061008": "I don't have lunch breaks. I just eat while reading case files.",
  "str_quest_chat_21061009": "Is that really necessary?",
  "str_quest_chat_21061010": "Eating requires only a hand and a mouth, and not the eyes. It's a waste of time.",
  "str_quest_chat_21062001": "What do you think of Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_21062002": "Let me think... As everyone says, it is a grand, majestic, and beautiful city.",
  "str_quest_chat_21062003": "Yes, I think so, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_21062004": "Especially at noon... When the sun is closest to us, the city is infinitely closer to the image residing in the people's minds.",
  "str_quest_chat_21062005": "Brilliant, bright, and flawless.",
  "str_quest_chat_21062006": "You take great pride in the city, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_21062007": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_21062008": "When I was young, my teacher at Dawn Academy said...",
  "str_quest_chat_21062009": "You must strive to be the radiant sun beneath the White Night.",
  "str_quest_chat_21063001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_21063002": "Afternoon. It's pretty rare to hear from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21063003": "Sorry, because I—",
  "str_quest_chat_21063004": "Huh...?",
  "str_quest_chat_21063005": "Because you...",
  "str_quest_chat_21063006": "Pittman?",
  "str_quest_chat_21063007": "Hello?",
  "str_quest_chat_21063008": "Sorry, because I've been quite busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21063009": "Well, I can already see that.",
  "str_quest_chat_21063010": "You might as well use your lunch break to get some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_21063011": "You're right. Goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat_21063012": "Goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101001": "It's incredible how the Colossus can communicate with people...",
  "str_quest_chat_21101002": "Soroz can do more than just talk!",
  "str_quest_chat_21101003": "I know.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101004": "And because of this... I'm really quite envious.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101005": "If Pompey could talk to me, things would be so much more interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101006": "I think Pompey is just fine as is. The strong, silent type thing fits.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101007": "Yes, Pompey is just fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101008": "But the same cannot be said of me. Whenever I am with Pompey, I am always so quiet.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101009": "If you want to talk to someone, you can always talk to me!",
  "str_quest_chat_21101010": "Yes... indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101011": "Unlike Pompey, you can talk.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101012": "Hedy, are you afraid of being alone?",
  "str_quest_chat_21101013": "I think I understand how you feel.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101014": "Afraid of being alone... How could such a thing be possible? I simply detest crowds of people.",
  "str_quest_chat_21101015": "At least... most of the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_21102001": "Have you ever been to a ball?",
  "str_quest_chat_21102002": "No... Why would you suddenly ask me that, though? I know how much you hate crowds...",
  "str_quest_chat_21102003": "I heard that Dawn Academy is putting on another ball. They're inviting people from outside the academy to attend...",
  "str_quest_chat_21102004": "Oh? So, anyone can go?",
  "str_quest_chat_21102005": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_21102006": "Then I'd love to see it for myself! A real ball!",
  "str_quest_chat_21102007": "Shall we go together, Hedy?",
  "str_quest_chat_21102008": "I...",
  "str_quest_chat_21102009": "I'm fine. You have a lot of friends. Ask them to go with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21102010": "What? Then why did you mention the ball in the first place!?",
  "str_quest_chat_21102011": "I was... just a little curious about what a ball might look like...",
  "str_quest_chat_21102012": "Then go and check it out! An opportunity like this doesn't come along every day, does it?",
  "str_quest_chat_21102013": "And I wouldn't feel comfortable without someone from Dawn Academy to show me around.",
  "str_quest_chat_21102014": "I know.",
  "str_quest_chat_21102015": "If you insist...",
  "str_quest_chat_21102016": "I suppose I can spare a little time. Hmph...",
  "str_quest_chat_21141001": "You are a Caelestite, correct?",
  "str_quest_chat_21141002": "Yep. Nice to meet you, Hedy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21141003": "I have read about your people. Your abilities are very interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_21141004": "I want to know... how does it feel like to experience another's inner world.",
  "str_quest_chat_21141005": "What about plants and animals? And inanimate objects?",
  "str_quest_chat_21141006": "Erm, hang on a minute, you're asking too many questions at the same time!",
  "str_quest_chat_21141007": "Slow down—one question at a time...",
  "str_quest_chat_21141008": "Sorry, I suppose I'm a little excited.",
  "str_quest_chat_21141009": "Seeing something only mentioned in a book right here before my eyes is quite unbelievable. I hope you can understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_21141010": "I understand, but I can't help to find it a little odd...",
  "str_quest_chat_21141011": "So, can you answer my questions?",
  "str_quest_chat_21141012": "Sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_21141013": "I have a lot of questions, you know... I hope you don't have too much planned for today.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142001": "I had a peculiar dream.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142002": "Oh? What did you dream about?",
  "str_quest_chat_21142003": "I dreamt I was eating an apple pie, and after I bit into it, the pie became outraged and ended up fighting with Pompey.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142004": "... Not very peculiar to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142005": "Yesterday, I dreamt of a dish Vice made was chasing me. Maybe it was the sequel to your dream...",
  "str_quest_chat_21142006": "It was quite interesting to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142007": "When I have realistic dreams, they always seem to come true, so having a ridiculous dream like that is something of comfort.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142008": "Dreaming about real life sounds cool... It's just like predicting the future!",
  "str_quest_chat_21142009": "It is far from predicting the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142010": "They are dreams, after all—as vague and fleeting as any other dream.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142011": "I cannot use them to benefit myself or avoid the inevitable. Instead, they plant the seeds of anxiety in my heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142012": "Well... maybe it would be better if you tried not to think about it so much?",
  "str_quest_chat_21142013": "No matter what happens, dreams are just dreams. They're over once you wake up.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142014": "Is it really that simple? Maybe you just have a talent for optimism.",
  "str_quest_chat_21142015": "Haha! Is that a compliment?",
  "str_quest_chat_21142016": "I'll try to do as you suggested.",
  "str_quest_chat_21143001": "I want to go to the north.",
  "str_quest_chat_21143002": "Oh? And why is that?",
  "str_quest_chat_21143003": "\"Under the northern Aurora, that is where the child of light was born.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_21143004": "I read these words in a book once.",
  "str_quest_chat_21143005": "Aren't you curious to see where all Aurorian civilizations first began?",
  "str_quest_chat_21143006": "All Aurorian civilizations... Everything sounds so interesting when you say it.",
  "str_quest_chat_21143007": "Imagine—the cities you've seen, the books you've read, and everyone you know... They all originate from that one place.",
  "str_quest_chat_21143008": "It was there that life we know burst forth and took on a new direction.",
  "str_quest_chat_21143009": "Oh, that's right—you're not an Aurorian.",
  "str_quest_chat_21143010": "I'm sorry, it must sound boring to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21143011": "No, of course not! I find your story very intriguing!",
  "str_quest_chat_21143012": "If I have a chance to see it, I will! Seriously!",
  "str_quest_chat_21143013": "Oh?",
  "str_quest_chat_21143014": "You're right. I'm not an Aurorian—I'm a Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat_21143015": "And with Soroz and me at your side, we can go anywhere!",
  "str_quest_chat_21151001": "You're awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_21151002": "Right, good morning, Hedy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21151003": "Wait a minute...! How did you know I was awake!?",
  "str_quest_chat_21151004": "Of course I knew.",
  "str_quest_chat_21151005": "I dreamt of us having this conversation.",
  "str_quest_chat_21151006": "You dreamt this? How is that possible?",
  "str_quest_chat_21151007": "I always have dreams like this.",
  "str_quest_chat_21151008": "I can't even tell the difference between dreams and reality, sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat_21151009": "Huh? So, that means you dreamt of me!",
  "str_quest_chat_21151010": "... *Cough*",
  "str_quest_chat_21151011": "Many people appear in my dreams. You are just one of them.",
  "str_quest_chat_21151012": "So, according to your dream, what will happen today?",
  "str_quest_chat_21151013": "Nothing. It will be an ordinary day.",
  "str_quest_chat_21151014": "I woke up because it was too boring.",
  "str_quest_chat_21152001": "Do you like watching the sunrise?",
  "str_quest_chat_21152002": "I do!",
  "str_quest_chat_21152003": "But usually, I can't get up early enough to see it.",
  "str_quest_chat_21152004": "Have you ever wondered why the sun always rises in the same direction?",
  "str_quest_chat_21152005": "No...",
  "str_quest_chat_21152006": "So... why does it?",
  "str_quest_chat_21152007": "I don't know, either. Many books have explained this everyday phenomenon, but a unified conclusion has not been reached.",
  "str_quest_chat_21152008": "But I rather believe what my teacher said—",
  "str_quest_chat_21152009": "The sun wishes to give all Aurorians toiling in the darkness their long-awaited direction.",
  "str_quest_chat_21153001": "I wonder, are butlers this stubborn all over the world?",
  "str_quest_chat_21153002": "Sorry, but I don't have a butler.",
  "str_quest_chat_21153003": "I have made it clear that I don't have so much time to waste on breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_21153004": "But this butler just insists on preparing ten courses for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_21153005": "What? I want ten courses for breakfast choice too!",
  "str_quest_chat_21154001": "The rising sun will devour the glows of the stars.",
  "str_quest_chat_21154002": "Are you feeling pity for the stars?",
  "str_quest_chat_21154003": "Why would I be?",
  "str_quest_chat_21154004": "The stars aren't gone. They'll return when the night falls.",
  "str_quest_chat_21154005": "From the distant past till now, stars have always worked the same way.",
  "str_quest_chat_21154006": "That's how it's written in the books.",
  "str_quest_chat_21154007": "So that's how you think...",
  "str_quest_chat_21161001": "The weather seems nice today.",
  "str_quest_chat_21161002": "It is! Do you have any plans for the afternoon, Hedy?",
  "str_quest_chat_21161003": "It's not often that the weather is this good. I think I'll give Pompey a good greasing.",
  "str_quest_chat_21161004": "Uh... Didn't you just grease it yesterday?",
  "str_quest_chat_21161005": "That's true, but yesterday I was afraid Pompey would get rusty because of the weather.",
  "str_quest_chat_21161006": "The weather is good today, so the grease will last longer if I apply it now.",
  "str_quest_chat_21161007": "And the day before yesterday...?",
  "str_quest_chat_21161008": "That's it! Your thirst for knowledge should be directed toward books, not the details of a lady's private life!",
  "str_quest_chat_21161009": "I was just saying...",
  "str_quest_chat_21162001": "I feel as though you yearn to live in Dawn Academy, correct?",
  "str_quest_chat_21162002": "Correct! Vice is always telling me about life at the academy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21162003": "Wearing a smart uniform, attending classes with your friends, and participating in all the activities organized by the academy...",
  "str_quest_chat_21162004": "I know. You lived alone for seventeen years, so the idea of being part of the collective must appeal to you greatly.",
  "str_quest_chat_21162005": "But in my experience, the academy is not such an interesting place.",
  "str_quest_chat_21162006": "They just asked me to take several exams in order to graduate officially. There was nothing else to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_21162007": "Didn't you have to go to class?",
  "str_quest_chat_21162008": "No. Studying at home was sufficient for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_21162009": "Wasn't there something called attendance or something?",
  "str_quest_chat_21162010": "The headmaster did have a thing or two to say about it. However, considering that I passed the graduation examination in only two years, I was allowed to graduate.",
  "str_quest_chat_21162011": "Wow... You're a genius...",
  "str_quest_chat_21163001": "It looks you have a very good relationship with Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_21163002": "Well, she was the first friend I made in this world.",
  "str_quest_chat_21163003": "Friend...?",
  "str_quest_chat_21163004": "She's an important companion of mine.",
  "str_quest_chat_21163005": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_21163006": "You've met Vice, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_21163007": "I am aware of her, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_21163008": "Were you classmates?",
  "str_quest_chat_21163009": "Well, she was my junior.",
  "str_quest_chat_21163010": "Wait a minute... Why do I remember her saying she was your senior?",
  "str_quest_chat_21163011": "Both of these statements are true.",
  "str_quest_chat_21163012": "When I entered the academy, she was my senior.",
  "str_quest_chat_21163013": "By the time I graduated, she was my junior.",
  "str_quest_chat_21163014": "Well, that was something...",
  "str_quest_chat_21164001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_21164002": "Afternoon, Hedy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21164003": "Is the cafe usually this lively?",
  "str_quest_chat_21164004": "Uh, I think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_21164005": "Is it disturbing your reading?",
  "str_quest_chat_21164006": "If they're too noisy, you can stay in your room.",
  "str_quest_chat_21164007": "Then just let me know what you need.",
  "str_quest_chat_21164008": "I don't need anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_21164009": "\"They\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_21164010": "Hmm, what?",
  "str_quest_chat_21164011": "You sound like a parent.",
  "str_quest_chat_21164012": "Do I?",
  "str_quest_chat_21164013": "Well, if it's too noisy for you, you can stay in your room...",
  "str_quest_chat_21164014": "Then just let me know what you need and I'll have the Fireflies deliver it to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21164015": "Like coffee, milk, or snacks, anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_21164016": "Well, I... I don't need anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_21164017": "Guess I'll go to bed now.",
  "str_quest_chat_21164018": "...Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_21164019": "Okay. Have a nice rest, Hedy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21181001": "I'm reading a book on Lumopolis history.",
  "str_quest_chat_21181002": "The more I read, the more feel that... the Schwartzes are indeed amazing.",
  "str_quest_chat_21181003": "You mean Carleen and the City Lord?",
  "str_quest_chat_21181004": "Yes. Carleen is someone I can look up to, and she will surely accomplish great things in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_21181005": "Lord Schwartz is... a key figure who occupies a great deal of space in the book, and he is also worthy of respect.",
  "str_quest_chat_21181006": "But the two of them don't seem to get along well...",
  "str_quest_chat_21181007": "Of course, I know this.",
  "str_quest_chat_21181008": "The book says that the seventeen-year-old Aurorian is going through a rebellious phase.",
  "str_quest_chat_21181009": "It does seem as though Carleen has turned away from her father...",
  "str_quest_chat_21201001": "Navigator, is there anything I can help you with?",
  "str_quest_chat_21201002": "Huh? Not really...",
  "str_quest_chat_21201003": "I'm relaxing right now... Just clearing my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_21201004": "Perfect! It's time to get that empty brain working! Think really hard if there's anything I can do for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_21201005": "Uh... Why do you want to help me so badly?",
  "str_quest_chat_21201006": "I'm still one person shy of my daily task to help others 5 times! And now I'm starting to panic!",
  "str_quest_chat_21201007": "Do you really need to be so strict with yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_21201008": "Of course! What would happen to the world if everyone decided to slack off!",
  "str_quest_chat_21201009": "Well... I want to do some exercise today, but I'm feeling too lazy to move.",
  "str_quest_chat_21201010": "Cordy, can you help me exercise?",
  "str_quest_chat_21201011": "I'm putting this task in your hands!",
  "str_quest_chat_21201012": "Got it!",
  "str_quest_chat_21201013": "Hey, wait a minute! How can I help you exercise?!",
  "str_quest_chat_21202001": "I can't fit into the clothes I bought just last year...",
  "str_quest_chat_21202002": "Why, though...? I've been watching what I eat...",
  "str_quest_chat_21202003": "It's normal, Cordy. You're still growing, from the looks of it...",
  "str_quest_chat_21202004": "What are you trying to say!?",
  "str_quest_chat_21202005": "No, no! I didn't mean anything by it!",
  "str_quest_chat_21202006": "What I meant to say is... gaining weight is not necessarily a bad thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_21202007": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_21202008": "Yeah! A lot of people around here are jealous of you!",
  "str_quest_chat_21202009": "Are you jealous of me, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_21202010": "Ah, not me... I mean, some of the girls are jealous of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21202011": "As for why... Well, you'll understand one day!",
  "str_quest_chat_21202012": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_21202013": "I can tell that you're trying to help me, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_21202014": "Thank you for your time. I feel like I won't even need to cry this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_21203001": "PlayerName! Could you please tell me where the exit to the Colossus is?",
  "str_quest_chat_21203002": "That depends on your location...",
  "str_quest_chat_21203003": "I'm... Well, I don't know the exact location! Sorry, I'm still getting used to this place...",
  "str_quest_chat_21203004": "I'll come and find you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21203005": "Oh! Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_21203999": "Look for Cordy aboard the Colossus. She seems to be in need of assistance.",
  "str_quest_chat_21242001": "Boo-hoo... Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_21242002": "Are you crying again?",
  "str_quest_chat_21242003": "What happened this time?",
  "str_quest_chat_21242004": "I just finished a combat mission...",
  "str_quest_chat_21242005": "Were you injured?",
  "str_quest_chat_21242006": "No... I beat my enemy...",
  "str_quest_chat_21242007": "But... from the moment the battle began... The tears... just wouldn't stop...",
  "str_quest_chat_21242008": "Forget about it. That's just the way you fight.",
  "str_quest_chat_21242009": "If you need to cry, cry as much as you want. It also looks kind of unique when you beat an enemy while crying!",
  "str_quest_chat_21242010": "Right! Thank you... I feel much better now...",
  "str_quest_chat_21242011": "If you feel better, then why are you still crying!?",
  "str_quest_chat_21251001": "Good morning, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_21251002": "Morning, Cordy!",
  "str_quest_chat_21251003": "It's another bright and beautiful morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_21251004": "What are your plans for today?",
  "str_quest_chat_21251005": "I don't have anything planned.",
  "str_quest_chat_21251006": "Oh? How can you get anything done without making a plan in advance?",
  "str_quest_chat_21251007": "Oh yeah, there is something I wanted to do today...",
  "str_quest_chat_21251008": "I wanted to do nothing at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_21252001": "I was helping a student just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_21252002": "The way he ran off in a hurry, still munching on his breakfast.. I really miss those days.",
  "str_quest_chat_21252003": "Huh? I've never gone to school...",
  "str_quest_chat_21252004": "What were you like as a student, Cordy?",
  "str_quest_chat_21252005": "Well... very ordinary, I suppose. I'm not sure exactly.",
  "str_quest_chat_21252006": "I only focused on my studies and didn't really know much about anything else...",
  "str_quest_chat_21252007": "B-But school is where I gradually grew up!",
  "str_quest_chat_21252008": "If I hadn't gone through all the stuff I did back then, I wouldn't be who I am today.",
  "str_quest_chat_21252009": "Haha! Well, of course. You always seem to look on the bright side for everything.",
  "str_quest_chat_21252010": "Wish you all the best in helping others today!",
  "str_quest_chat_21252011": "Awesome!",
  "str_quest_chat_21253001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_21253002": "Morning, Cordy. Nice to see you're full of energy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21253003": "Hehe, because while passing the commercial strip today, a child gave me a compliment!",
  "str_quest_chat_21253004": "That must have felt good.",
  "str_quest_chat_21253005": "Hehe... So Navigator, let's start the day together with loads of energy!",
  "str_quest_chat_21253006": "What a great suggestion!",
  "str_quest_chat_21261001": "*sob* The old lady on the high street gave me some crepes...",
  "str_quest_chat_21261002": "That's nice. It seems everyone's eager to fill your belly wherever you go.",
  "str_quest_chat_21261003": "But... If I eat them, I'll be over my calorie intake for today!",
  "str_quest_chat_21261004": "Will these crepes keep until tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat_21261005": "I think they'll probably go bad.",
  "str_quest_chat_21261006": "Must I finish them today?",
  "str_quest_chat_21261007": "If you are... you'll need to ramp up today's exercise.",
  "str_quest_chat_21261008": "Boo-hoo... It looks like I have no choice but to go running!",
  "str_quest_chat_21261009": "That settles it! I'm gonna run ten kilometers after work!",
  "str_quest_chat_21261010": "That was a quick decision!",
  "str_quest_chat_21261011": "It smells so good... So sweet!",
  "str_quest_chat_21262001": "Remember to eat on time, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_21262002": "Cordy... This is the third time you've reminded me today...",
  "str_quest_chat_21262003": "You're treating me as if I'm a baby...",
  "str_quest_chat_21262004": "It's just that you look so thin. I was only worried that you might not be eating properly.",
  "str_quest_chat_21262005": "On the Colossus, you should worry more about food poisoning than me being starving...",
  "str_quest_chat_21262006": "Ah! It's almost time for work!",
  "str_quest_chat_21262007": "See you later, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_21262008": "See you, Cordy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21262009": "Remember to eat on time!",
  "str_quest_chat_21263001": "Navigator, have you cleaned your room since I last came to the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_21263002": "Huh... Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_21263003": "I know what that means... You haven't cleaned it, have you!?",
  "str_quest_chat_21263004": "I cleaned it! Erm... Just now... Yeah!",
  "str_quest_chat_21263005": "You really are a terrible liar. I could tell right away.",
  "str_quest_chat_21263006": "Fine... I haven't cleaned my room...",
  "str_quest_chat_21263007": "In that case, let me help you clean it this afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_21263008": "Really, there's no need for that! I'll just clean it myself. I wouldn't want to bother you, Cordy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21263009": "If you really don't want to bother me, please clean it up before I ask next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_21263010": "I've already added \"Clean up the Navigator's room\" to my agenda.",
  "str_quest_chat_21263011": "If you really insist on ruining my plans... Waaaaah!",
  "str_quest_chat_21263012": "D-Don't! You can't start crying over something so minor!",
  "str_quest_chat_21264001": "Hello! G-Good afternoon, N-Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_21264002": "Afternoon, Cordy!",
  "str_quest_chat_21264003": "H-H-Have you eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_21264004": "I have. What's wrong, Cordy? Why are you stuttering?",
  "str_quest_chat_21264005": "T-T-To stop a prank this m-m-moring, I-I-I...",
  "str_quest_chat_21264006": "I drank a suspicious beverage for the sake of the poor a-a-ants!",
  "str_quest_chat_21264007": "Ants are in your jurisdiction too?",
  "str_quest_chat_21264008": "E-E-Environmental p-p-protection is part of a sheriff's j-j-job!",
  "str_quest_chat_21264009": "I-I-I must go see a doctor now. S-s-see you later, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_21264010": "See you. Hope you get better soon!",
  "str_quest_chat_21301001": "Navigator, it's me, Hachi. Don't you just love flying through the air?",
  "str_quest_chat_21301002": "Huh? Where did that question come from all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_21301003": "It always seems strange when you say something that is even slightly serious.",
  "str_quest_chat_21301004": "Hey! I'm compassionate, don't you know! I'm a master of artistic appreciation!",
  "str_quest_chat_21301005": "I asked you this because... Gin and I have always wanted to complete a certain painting.",
  "str_quest_chat_21301006": "A painting of Astra from the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_21301007": "You're there too, Gin? Did your father leave you this painting?",
  "str_quest_chat_21301008": "Yes. You see, while neither of us are master painters, we do have some hidden talent.",
  "str_quest_chat_21301009": "I think it is our mission to complete the painting. That must be what our talent is for.",
  "str_quest_chat_21301010": "I think heaven was kind enough to give us this talent so that we don't starve to death.",
  "str_quest_chat_21301011": "Can't you be more romantic just this once?!",
  "str_quest_chat_21302001": "You wish to see the PlayerName Collection? Bring the money to the bridge if you want the goods.",
  "str_quest_chat_21302002": "What collection?",
  "str_quest_chat_21302003": "No way...",
  "str_quest_chat_21302004": "That wasn't meant for you! Just forget what you saw!",
  "str_quest_chat_21302005": "Stay right where you are!",
  "str_quest_chat_21302999": "My collection? The collection of underground paintings being circulated among the Aurorians? Those two... I have to go to the bridge and find them.",
  "str_quest_chat_21351001": "Oh! Good morning, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_21351002": "Good morning. Is that you, Hachi?",
  "str_quest_chat_21351003": "I'm here, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_21351004": "Of course! And Gin, too! You two are always together.",
  "str_quest_chat_21351005": "Guess what day it is today?",
  "str_quest_chat_21351006": "Huh? Is there something special happening today?",
  "str_quest_chat_21351007": "Let me check my calendar...",
  "str_quest_chat_21351008": "It's not a holiday. Is it someone's birthday?",
  "str_quest_chat_21351009": "No, no, no. Today, is actually—",
  "str_quest_chat_21351010": "A good day to make money.",
  "str_quest_chat_21351011": "Hey, Gin! That was my line!",
  "str_quest_chat_21361001": "Hey, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_21361002": "Can you help me out? I can't decide what to have for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_21361003": "Huh? You're asking me?",
  "str_quest_chat_21361004": "Yeah. Gin doesn't have any ideas, either... and he always puts down my suggestions!",
  "str_quest_chat_21361005": "We've been eating the hot dogs you suggested for a week now.",
  "str_quest_chat_21361006": "Even if we're all dogs, we don't have to stick together, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_21361007": "So, what should we eat then, Gin!?",
  "str_quest_chat_21361008": "I don't know.",
  "str_quest_chat_21361009": "Come on, Navigator! Help me quickly before I starve to death!",
  "str_quest_chat_21361010": "Vegetable stew?",
  "str_quest_chat_21361011": "Sounds good. I don't mind eating something light from time to time.",
  "str_quest_chat_21361012": "You mean... not even a single chunk of meat!? Are you messing with me, Gin!?",
  "str_quest_chat_21361013": "Barbecue?",
  "str_quest_chat_21361014": "Now, that's an idea! Come on, Gin! Let's go!",
  "str_quest_chat_21361015": "Didn't we have barbecue just last night? I can't eat it again...",
  "str_quest_chat_21361016": "Why don't you two just eat separately?",
  "str_quest_chat_21361017": "Huh? What a revolutionary idea!",
  "str_quest_chat_21361018": "I agree with the Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_21361019": "You guys should think of it a long time ago!",
  "str_quest_chat_21362001": "Why is it always so hot at noon?",
  "str_quest_chat_21362002": "It's not hot... I don't quite understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_21362003": "I can never tell whether you're being sarcastic or not.",
  "str_quest_chat_21362004": "But even if it were hot, I wouldn't speak with such cold sarcasm.",
  "str_quest_chat_21362005": "Now you're definitely being sarcastic!",
  "str_quest_chat_21363001": "Guess what the artist and super-cool assassin had for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_21363002": "Err...",
  "str_quest_chat_21363003": "I give up. Frankly, I don't get artists...",
  "str_quest_chat_21363004": "Cool mint lollipops, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_21363005": "And many of them.",
  "str_quest_chat_21363006": "That doesn't sound healthy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21363007": "Artists don't need to be healthy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21363008": "Neither do assassins.",
  "str_quest_chat_21364001": "Caelestites don't need to cool off, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_21364002": "Err... I think so.",
  "str_quest_chat_21364003": "How enviable!",
  "str_quest_chat_21364004": "Thankfully though, all we have to do is stick our tongues out in the afternoon for a breather.",
  "str_quest_chat_21364005": "Isn't this just about regulating temperature?",
  "str_quest_chat_21364006": "What does time have to do with it?",
  "str_quest_chat_21364007": "Just imagine, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_21364008": "Late at night on the Colossus, the twins with their tongues sticking out making strange panting noises...",
  "str_quest_chat_21364009": "Ahem, I see what you're getting at.",
  "str_quest_chat_21364010": "I guess it's a good thing you're only doing this in the afternoon most times.",
  "str_quest_chat_21381001": "Navigator, would you like to go for a walk?",
  "str_quest_chat_21381002": "You don't have any other plans, do you?",
  "str_quest_chat_21381003": "I do have time, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_21381004": "I'm too tired to walk with you guys!",
  "str_quest_chat_21381005": "You walk too slowly.",
  "str_quest_chat_21381006": "Yeah, it's not good for your health if you always lack exercise.",
  "str_quest_chat_21381007": "You can't seriously be asking me to keep up when you two run like tireless dogs!",
  "str_quest_chat_21382001": "Hey! Navigator, would you like to buy a painting?",
  "str_quest_chat_21382002": "Something to hang up in your Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_21382003": "I guarantee you a world-famous painting of world-class quality!",
  "str_quest_chat_21382004": "I'm Hachi, after all! Paintings are my specialty!",
  "str_quest_chat_21382005": "How can I afford a world-famous painting...?",
  "str_quest_chat_21382006": "And where did you get it?",
  "str_quest_chat_21382007": "It's really difficult to get authentic work these days, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_21382008": "Making replicas is quite simple.",
  "str_quest_chat_21382009": "That's right, Gin.",
  "str_quest_chat_21383001": "Navigator, you seem surprised that we call ourselves artists...",
  "str_quest_chat_21383002": "You two... with those thuggish weapons in your hands... You don't look like artists at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_21383003": "Besides, aren't you Istvan's bodyguards?",
  "str_quest_chat_21383004": "These weapons are for self-defense! No one in Umbraton listens to you if you just wave a brush around, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_21383005": "As for being bodyguards—",
  "str_quest_chat_21383006": "That's only for the convenience of doing business.",
  "str_quest_chat_21383007": "I know that Gin can paint... But what about you, Hachi?",
  "str_quest_chat_21383008": "Not every artist has to be a talented painter!",
  "str_quest_chat_21383009": "My artistry lies in my eyes!",
  "str_quest_chat_21383010": "Okay, I see. You really can't paint.",
  "str_quest_chat_21383011": "But he can't do business without me! Right, Gin!",
  "str_quest_chat_21383012": "Maybe I should rethink whether it's necessary to share my profits with someone who can't actually paint...",
  "str_quest_chat_21383013": "How could you!",
  "str_quest_chat_21384001": "Have you ever considered developing the commercial value of the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_21384002": "What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_21384003": "Believe me, I can see at a glance that this big guy has what it takes to be a star!",
  "str_quest_chat_21384004": "You could let artists come and paint him, or make an exhibition for tourists to visit! Even if it is purely a gimmick, you can make a lot of money!",
  "str_quest_chat_21384005": "No way! Soroz isn't some kind of tool to make money. Soroz is my friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_21384006": "Huh? Can't Soroz be both?",
  "str_quest_chat_21384007": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_21384008": "Gin is my friend, but if there ever was an opportunity to make money off of him, I would not even hesitate.",
  "str_quest_chat_21384009": "Same here.",
  "str_quest_chat_21384010": "Hang on... Gin, aren't you two brothers...?",
  "str_quest_chat_21384011": "Yeah... So what?",
  "str_quest_chat_21384012": "We're joking, right, Gin? We're just messing around!",
  "str_quest_chat_21385001": "Phew...",
  "str_quest_chat_21385002": "Phew...",
  "str_quest_chat_21385003": "What's up with you two...?",
  "str_quest_chat_21385004": "We're sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21385005": "Go to bed then! What are you doing messaging me!?",
  "str_quest_chat_21385006": "We can't help it. It's built into our canine DNA...",
  "str_quest_chat_21385007": "If nobody hears us sighing, our grunts will lose all meaning.",
  "str_quest_chat_21385008": "Phew...",
  "str_quest_chat_21386001": "Hey, I'm going to see the boss again tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_21386002": "I have a stomachache.",
  "str_quest_chat_21386003": "You always have a stomachache when it's time to see him, Gin!",
  "str_quest_chat_21386004": "By your boss, you mean... Istvan, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_21386005": "Right. We rely on him to make a living, so he really is like our boss.",
  "str_quest_chat_21386006": "Hachi, are you afraid of Istvan, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_21386007": "Haha! No, not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_21386008": "But Gin, isn't it a good idea to go see your boss and make some money?",
  "str_quest_chat_21386009": "Dealing with that guy always comes at a price.",
  "str_quest_chat_21386010": "Actually, Istvan understands us well. He knows exactly how to get along with us.",
  "str_quest_chat_21386011": "But that's the problem, too...",
  "str_quest_chat_21386012": "It's not easy to get along with people who are too smart.",
  "str_quest_chat_21401001": "Hello, stranger!",
  "str_quest_chat_21401002": "Hello, Lola.",
  "str_quest_chat_21401003": "I prepared a surprise for you as thanks for taking care of me!",
  "str_quest_chat_21401004": "Is it something honey flavored?",
  "str_quest_chat_21401005": "Nope, but I can give you that next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_21401006": "Is it wild roses?",
  "str_quest_chat_21401007": "Close!",
  "str_quest_chat_21401008": "Ta-da! Surprise!",
  "str_quest_chat_21401009": "I made you an adorable dress!",
  "str_quest_chat_21401010": "It even has my favorite pink bows and hearts made of woven lace!",
  "str_quest_chat_21401011": "Layers of tulle make it more flouncy! It looks absolutely lovely!",
  "str_quest_chat_21401012": "I asked the Fireflies to send it to your room.",
  "str_quest_chat_21401013": "Also, I made sure the Fireflies would announce it while on the way.",
  "str_quest_chat_21401014": "\"Delivering PlayerName's pink tiered skirt!\"\n\"Pink tiered skirt on the way!\"",
  "str_quest_chat_21401015": "Has the dress arrived in my room?",
  "str_quest_chat_21401016": "Yes, of course. You'll see it once you get back.",
  "str_quest_chat_21401017": "Ahem... Th-thank you....",
  "str_quest_chat_21401018": "It will be part of my collection, and stay in my room forever.",
  "str_quest_chat_21402001": "Stranger! What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_21402002": "I'm checking the ledger.",
  "str_quest_chat_21402003": "Wow! Taking on the responsibility of verifying all Colossus expenses, you're indeed very capable!",
  "str_quest_chat_21402004": "I... I've been putting it off for a very long time.",
  "str_quest_chat_21402005": "I'm daydreaming.",
  "str_quest_chat_21402006": "Eh? I thought I was the only one who does that.",
  "str_quest_chat_21402007": "You're always being so carefree and happy, I sometimes envy you, Lola.",
  "str_quest_chat_21402008": "Oh... A lot of people say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_21402009": "Is being happy wrong somehow?",
  "str_quest_chat_21402010": "Eh? Where does that idea come from?",
  "str_quest_chat_21402011": "People envy you because we can never have your simplicity, we always have troubles to worry about.",
  "str_quest_chat_21402012": "But if you have troubles, you can always find a way to resolve them. Isn't that enough?",
  "str_quest_chat_21402013": "After all, being happy is the most important thing when living!",
  "str_quest_chat_21402014": "Yes! Lola, you're absolutely right!",
  "str_quest_chat_21402015": "For example, my worry today is being bored. So all I think about is to have some fun!",
  "str_quest_chat_21402016": "Hmmm... Having fun...",
  "str_quest_chat_21402017": "Well, why don't I make clothes for the Fireflies?",
  "str_quest_chat_21402018": "I'd like to dress them up in blue bunny style outfits!",
  "str_quest_chat_21402019": "No, that's not the answer!",
  "str_quest_chat_21402020": "You are bringing me even more trouble by doing that!",
  "str_quest_chat_21451001": "Mm... morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_21451002": "Morning, Lola.",
  "str_quest_chat_21451003": "You... woke up already?",
  "str_quest_chat_21451004": "Yes! I still have lots of work to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_21451005": "Okay, Stranger... I'm gonna continue sleeping...",
  "str_quest_chat_21451006": "Good luck... with works...",
  "str_quest_chat_21451007": "You're here to show off, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_21452001": "Today, Lola was woken up by the birdies!",
  "str_quest_chat_21452002": "Today must be a beautiful and lucky day! Morning, Stranger!",
  "str_quest_chat_21452003": "Morning. You seem to be in a good mood, Lola.",
  "str_quest_chat_21452004": "Of course, and I'm here to share this happiness with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21452005": "I hope you have a beautiful day too!",
  "str_quest_chat_21452006": "That's a sweet wish, thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21453001": "Good morning, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_21453002": "Morning, Lola.",
  "str_quest_chat_21453003": "You seem to be in a great mood.",
  "str_quest_chat_21453004": "Of course! The queen just gave me a new jar of honey a few days ago!",
  "str_quest_chat_21453005": "Honey crystals, wonder food full of sweet love and the power of the snow!",
  "str_quest_chat_21453006": "That does sound unique.",
  "str_quest_chat_21453007": "Honey, honey... Cold and icy...",
  "str_quest_chat_21453008": "Hope you have a great day, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_21453009": "You too, Lola!",
  "str_quest_chat_21461001": "Oh, this is so good!",
  "str_quest_chat_21461002": "What are you eating? Let me guess... honey cake, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_21461003": "That's not it. I'm eating...",
  "str_quest_chat_21461004": "Spicy honey sandworm!",
  "str_quest_chat_21461005": "Is that... edible?",
  "str_quest_chat_21461006": "C'mon! As long as there's honey, anything's delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_21461007": "This sweetness... Ugh, suddenly my tooth is aching.",
  "str_quest_chat_21462001": "Stranger, what do you do when you're relaxing?",
  "str_quest_chat_21462002": "Sleep. Sleep brings happiness!",
  "str_quest_chat_21462003": "You said it!",
  "str_quest_chat_21462004": "What about eating? Does eating bring you happiness?",
  "str_quest_chat_21462005": "You should know... that everyone's cooking here is...",
  "str_quest_chat_21462006": "It's more or less...",
  "str_quest_chat_21462007": "Oh! I see where you're going with! You don't like their cooking!",
  "str_quest_chat_21462008": "Then do you want to try my food? I'm sure you'll like it!",
  "str_quest_chat_21462009": "Uh... But I've had my lunch today.",
  "str_quest_chat_21462010": "Next time, okay? I promise.",
  "str_quest_chat_21462011": "Hmph! You're just saying that to put me off!",
  "str_quest_chat_21463001": "Stranger, why do your Fireflies talk?",
  "str_quest_chat_21463002": "Why can the Colossus fly? Is Soroz a living being or a piece of tech?",
  "str_quest_chat_21463003": "What was your impression when you went to Northland for the first time? Do you think it's too cold there?",
  "str_quest_chat_21463004": "Stranger? Stranger? Why aren't you replying?",
  "str_quest_chat_21463005": "Strangeeeeeerrrr!",
  "str_quest_chat_21463006": "I'll answer you when I'm awake!!",
  "str_quest_chat_21463007": "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were sleeping!",
  "str_quest_chat_21463008": "Give me those answers when you wake up! I'm so confused!",
  "str_quest_chat_21463009": "Have a honey-sweet dream for your afternoon nap!",
  "str_quest_chat_21464001": "A splendid good afternoon, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_21464002": "Afternoon, Lola.",
  "str_quest_chat_21464003": "Hehe, Umbraton's fashion booklet is real pretty, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_21464004": "I was looking at it all morning today.",
  "str_quest_chat_21464005": "There were so many cute dresses that I wanted!",
  "str_quest_chat_21464006": "If I ever get the chance, I'll love to go see them with my own eyes!",
  "str_quest_chat_21464007": "Well, I'm sure you'll get that chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_21464008": "Hehehe, Umbraton, Umbraton, here I come!",
  "str_quest_chat_21481001": "Evening, Stranger! I left a gift at your door!",
  "str_quest_chat_21481002": "Tell me you didn't catch a hive of bees, or did you?",
  "str_quest_chat_21481003": "Or did you glue the door to my room with honey!?",
  "str_quest_chat_21481004": "Please, Lola, you would never do that, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_21481005": "Wh-what are you even thinking...",
  "str_quest_chat_21481006": "Huff... Sorry. I've been traumatized by all the things that these people did on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_21481007": "I placed a bouquet of roses at your door, nothing more!",
  "str_quest_chat_21481008": "I was just hoping you'll have a good sleep with it.",
  "str_quest_chat_21481009": "Ah! Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21481010": "Then have a good rest too, Lola. Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_21501001": "I have a question to ask you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21501002": "There's actually something that you don't know?",
  "str_quest_chat_21501003": "Because...",
  "str_quest_chat_21501004": "This problem is beyond my knowledge.",
  "str_quest_chat_21501005": "A problem that is beyond your knowledge... I'm all ears!",
  "str_quest_chat_21501006": "Please forgive my abruptness, I would like to ask...",
  "str_quest_chat_21501007": "Do you only have this one outfit?",
  "str_quest_chat_21501008": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_21501009": "But I wash it every day!",
  "str_quest_chat_21501010": "No...",
  "str_quest_chat_21501011": "It's just that my clothes all look the same.",
  "str_quest_chat_21501012": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_21501013": "Poor child...",
  "str_quest_chat_21501014": "I wouldn't say that, and it's nothing bad...",
  "str_quest_chat_21501015": "Actually, I would like to design a few outfits for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21501016": "After listening to your answer, I believe...",
  "str_quest_chat_21501017": "I know how the first outfit should be designed.",
  "str_quest_chat_21501018": "And... may I know what it is?",
  "str_quest_chat_21501019": "It should be a coat with rabbit ears.",
  "str_quest_chat_21501020": "I... appreciate your kindness!",
  "str_quest_chat_21541001": "Thank you for your kind invitation.",
  "str_quest_chat_21541002": "Oh, this Colossus really lives up to its name!",
  "str_quest_chat_21541003": "The white wings of the Colossus are shimmering under the sun...",
  "str_quest_chat_21541004": "It is breathtakingly magnificent.",
  "str_quest_chat_21541005": "May our interactions also be shining as your Colossus under the light.",
  "str_quest_chat_21541006": "Nourishing each other and leading the way for the young generation!",
  "str_quest_chat_21541007": "Wh-what a complex statement!",
  "str_quest_chat_21541008": "Hello, I, uh...",
  "str_quest_chat_21541009": "I'm the Navigator of this Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_21541010": "Oh, no. I don't know what else I should say...",
  "str_quest_chat_21541011": "Haha. You seem to be a person of few words, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_21541012": "What about...",
  "str_quest_chat_21541013": "I will let my rabbits teach you the arts of communication.",
  "str_quest_chat_21541014": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_21541015": "Hahaha. My apologies.",
  "str_quest_chat_21541016": "I sometimes make these jokes with people I know well. You make me feel familiar at first sight, I guess I just can't help myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_21541017": "So it was a joke...",
  "str_quest_chat_21541018": "I look forward to working with you from here on.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542001": "Hmm, how very strange.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542002": "Did something strange happen?",
  "str_quest_chat_21542003": "In your opinion, Navigator, when is the best period of life...",
  "str_quest_chat_21542004": "... To grow oneself to full bloom?",
  "str_quest_chat_21542005": "In one's child time?",
  "str_quest_chat_21542006": "When one is in total ignorance of the world...",
  "str_quest_chat_21542007": "Slowly grasps the various techniques of this world.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542008": "So that makes childhood the best time for growth, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_21542009": "In one's adult time?",
  "str_quest_chat_21542010": "A lot of things that one doesn't understand before...",
  "str_quest_chat_21542011": "Will only be understood once one enters adulthood.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542012": "This is the time when one's efforts are the most focused.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542013": "And the growth one experiences is also more substantial, I think.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542014": "It is good to hear from your opinions.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542015": "When I first laid my eyes on this world...",
  "str_quest_chat_21542016": "I desperately tried to absorb as much knowledge as I could to satisfy my curiosity.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542017": "But I found myself stuck in one spot later.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542018": "Yet today, I am surprised to see that...",
  "str_quest_chat_21542019": "I have experienced tremendous growth again.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542020": "Really? Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat_21542021": "So maybe there is no such thing as the best time.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542022": "One will eventually grow as long as they keep working hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542023": "The phase or time does not matter. I share my thoughts with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21542024": "Are you telling me I should work hard in a subtle way?",
  "str_quest_chat_21543001": "In your opinion, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_21543002": "What is the purpose of mastering Luminatics?",
  "str_quest_chat_21543003": "Is it for protection?",
  "str_quest_chat_21543004": "We are living in such a chaotic time.",
  "str_quest_chat_21543005": "Power gives us the ability to protect those closest to us.",
  "str_quest_chat_21543006": "And safeguard them from all harm.",
  "str_quest_chat_21543007": "Hahaha, looks like we share the same view.",
  "str_quest_chat_21543008": "Then do you have someone you want to protect?",
  "str_quest_chat_21543009": "I want to protect everyone who came to the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_21543010": "I have to say, your ambition is quite something.",
  "str_quest_chat_21543011": "What a pity... that you don't possess Luminatics.",
  "str_quest_chat_21543012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_21543013": "Please don't be frustrated. I believe that your friends on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_21543014": "Will all protect you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21543015": "And so am I.",
  "str_quest_chat_21551001": "What a beautiful morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_21551002": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_21551003": "Morning... You're awaked so early.",
  "str_quest_chat_21551004": "The first ray of sunlight today has shone on this vast land.",
  "str_quest_chat_21551005": "And I will not miss any chance to enjoy the sunshine.",
  "str_quest_chat_21551006": "Oh, I'm so touched...",
  "str_quest_chat_21551007": "Then get up already.",
  "str_quest_chat_21551008": "So...",
  "str_quest_chat_21551009": "You're another one of them to get me out of bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_21552001": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_21552002": "Hmmm... Not awake yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_21552003": "Ah, I'm back. Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_21552004": "Oh, looks like you're not asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_21552005": "I thought you'd be like those rabbits just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_21552006": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_21552007": "Only rabbits love to sleep in during the day and come out at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_21552008": "You must be mistaken something!",
  "str_quest_chat_21561001": "Are you feeling weary?",
  "str_quest_chat_21561002": "How do know that I'm sleepy right now...?",
  "str_quest_chat_21561003": "Aurorians are prone to sleepiness after lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_21561004": "And it looks like Caelestites are no exception either.",
  "str_quest_chat_21561005": "But... do you know where the best place to take a nap in?",
  "str_quest_chat_21561006": "Where is that?",
  "str_quest_chat_21561007": "A window seat in the library.",
  "str_quest_chat_21561008": "I'll just... take a nap in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_21562001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_21562002": "It was a great lunch today.",
  "str_quest_chat_21562003": "... It is rare that someone likes the food here!",
  "str_quest_chat_21562004": "The plants or animals must spend much effort to grow...",
  "str_quest_chat_21562005": "So, I feel that it is not right for me to belittle them.",
  "str_quest_chat_21562006": "Are you trying to protest to me...?",
  "str_quest_chat_21562007": "That the lunch taste awful?",
  "str_quest_chat_21562008": "The answer lies within your heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_21562009": "I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat_21581001": "*Sighs*",
  "str_quest_chat_21581002": "Why the sighing?",
  "str_quest_chat_21581003": "Did something depressing happen?",
  "str_quest_chat_21581004": "Oh, indeed. Such an unfortunate event.",
  "str_quest_chat_21581005": "It happens to me every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_21581006": "Yet, it still pains me every time it happens.",
  "str_quest_chat_21581007": "... What in the world happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_21581008": "Look, there is no trace of sunlight on the land anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_21581009": "So that's what it is...",
  "str_quest_chat_21582001": "Do you know, before one sleeps at night...",
  "str_quest_chat_21582002": "What is the one ritual that is necessary for people to engage in now?",
  "str_quest_chat_21582003": "I know!",
  "str_quest_chat_21582004": "This is easy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21582005": "The one ritual before sleep is... Saying goodnight!",
  "str_quest_chat_21582006": "I'm surprised you found it so easy.",
  "str_quest_chat_21582007": "I don't know...",
  "str_quest_chat_21582008": "I've never engaged in any ritual before sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_21582009": "Oh, don't you say \"goodnight\" to people before sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_21582010": "That actually counts as a ritual?",
  "str_quest_chat_21582011": "Now then. Goodnight, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_21582012": "Goodnight, Novio.",
  "str_quest_chat_21583001": "Now then, good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_21583002": "I truly envy you...",
  "str_quest_chat_21583003": "It feels like you're taking it easy every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_21583004": "You shouldn't have much trouble sleeping, I suppose...",
  "str_quest_chat_21583005": "Oh my, it looks like a particular Navigator is quite moody today.",
  "str_quest_chat_21583006": "So you even perceived that...",
  "str_quest_chat_21583007": "It's just that today has been exhausting. I would really use some relaxation.",
  "str_quest_chat_21583008": "Do you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_21583009": "Being relaxed is not dependent on what you do, but your mindset.",
  "str_quest_chat_21583010": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_21583011": "If you can't find peace within yourself...",
  "str_quest_chat_21583012": "Then, even if you rested for a whole day, you won't feel relaxed.",
  "str_quest_chat_21583013": "That does seem to make sense...",
  "str_quest_chat_21583014": "I'll try to adjust my mindset and get a good night's sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_21583015": "Novio, aren't you sleeping yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_21583016": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_21583017": "I do have trouble sleeping tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_21584001": "Do Caelestites dress up fireflies during festivals?",
  "str_quest_chat_21584002": "I don't think so...",
  "str_quest_chat_21584003": "How unfortunate for those adorable creatures.",
  "str_quest_chat_21584004": "Adorable creatures?",
  "str_quest_chat_21584005": "Looking at them flying around like that... I just can't help wanting to dress them up!",
  "str_quest_chat_21584006": "Like putting bunny ears on them and they will become flying bunnies...",
  "str_quest_chat_21584007": "But that's gonna burden the fireflies...",
  "str_quest_chat_21585001": "Good night, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_21585002": "It's so late now your body can't support your mind in a state of being awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_21585003": "So I thought you would be having sweet dreams right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_21585004": "Therefore, consider my evening greeting today as a blessing.",
  "str_quest_chat_21585005": "Hmm, I hope all your nights will be spent in peaceful slumber.",
  "str_quest_chat_21585006": "Night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641001": "You.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641002": "Are you talking to me, Fafnir?",
  "str_quest_chat_21641003": "I need a few things.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641004": "Okay. What are they?",
  "str_quest_chat_21641005": "First, games.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641006": "Got it. I'll let Vice know to send you all games on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641007": "Excellent.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641008": "Also, pen and paper.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641009": "I have to start on a new issue.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641010": "No problem, I'll get them ready for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641011": "Hmph.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641012": "That's it, so don't bother me.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641013": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_21641014": "Don't you want to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_21641015": "I do not need food to sustain my physical self.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641016": "Okay, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641017": "Wait.",
  "str_quest_chat_21641018": "Will you be serving sweet curry?",
  "str_quest_chat_21741001": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_21741002": "?",
  "str_quest_chat_21741003": "Hello, my name is Elma Joui.",
  "str_quest_chat_21741004": "It's not necessary to be so formal all the time, Elma!",
  "str_quest_chat_21741005": "No? Then I'll cut to the chase.",
  "str_quest_chat_21741006": "Pardon me, but I have a favor to ask of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_21741007": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_21741008": "I'm not sure if the concept of \"tabs\" exists in this world...",
  "str_quest_chat_21741009": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_21741010": "I, uh, haven't... eaten for days now...",
  "str_quest_chat_21741011": "And the lodging... Oh, it costs money everywhere! Money is the vilest human invention ever!",
  "str_quest_chat_21741012": "I get it. But it's all free if you move to the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_21741013": "Huh, free?",
  "str_quest_chat_21741014": "Like for rent, meals...",
  "str_quest_chat_21741015": "Yeah, totally free!",
  "str_quest_chat_21741016": "You're such a wonderful person! I'm indebted to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_21741017": "Not a problem!",
  "str_quest_chat_21741018": "But there's a small caveat.",
  "str_quest_chat_21741019": "It's okay, I'm fine with anything as long as I get food!",
  "str_quest_chat_21741020": "Meals are free, but don't overstuff yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_21841001": "Hello, can you receive this?",
  "str_quest_chat_21841002": "Yes, Lucoa.",
  "str_quest_chat_21841003": "It's quite fun communicating through this means.",
  "str_quest_chat_21841004": "Your world is a constant surprise to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_21841005": "Really? It's all normal to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_21841006": "The vehicle you ride in is called the Colossus, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_21841007": "Yeah, its name is Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_21841008": "It's enormous, yet exquisitely detailed, with an excellent overall design.",
  "str_quest_chat_21841009": "It would not be an exaggeration to call it a wonder.",
  "str_quest_chat_21841010": "You think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_21841011": "Soroz will be happy to hear that!",
  "str_quest_chat_21841012": "That goes for you too, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_21841013": "Me?",
  "str_quest_chat_21841014": "Yes, you're also a constant surprise to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_21841015": "So, let's all get along!",
  "str_quest_chat_21841016": "Yeah, let's!",
  "str_quest_chat_21941001": "Should I address you as Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_21941002": "Hi, Tohru!",
  "str_quest_chat_21941003": "Say, what's going on with your Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_21941004": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_21941005": "It's a mess, and not one professional maid in sight!",
  "str_quest_chat_21941006": "It's an epic fail!",
  "str_quest_chat_21941007": "Uh, well, everyone's so busy usually...",
  "str_quest_chat_21941008": "Then that's on you!",
  "str_quest_chat_21941009": "You should be the maid!",
  "str_quest_chat_21941010": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_21941011": "But, but... I've never...",
  "str_quest_chat_21941012": "Don't ever restrain yourself with those rules!",
  "str_quest_chat_21941013": "Come on...",
  "str_quest_chat_21941014": "Anyway, rest assured I will show you how...",
  "str_quest_chat_21941015": "Wait for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_21941016": "Hold on, I didn't even agree to it!",
  "str_quest_chat_21941017": "Hello?!",
  "str_quest_chat_22041001": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_22041002": "I'm Kanna Kobayashi.",
  "str_quest_chat_22041003": "Hi, Kanna!",
  "str_quest_chat_22041004": "You learned to use the terminal?",
  "str_quest_chat_22041005": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_22041006": "How are you doing on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_22041007": "There are a lot of things I have never seen before, very interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_22041008": "But...",
  "str_quest_chat_22041009": "Is there something wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_22041010": "Vice's cooking is bad.",
  "str_quest_chat_22041011": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_22041012": "But the bugs here are delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat_22041013": "I like.",
  "str_quest_chat_22041014": "You shouldn't eat them!",
  "str_quest_chat_22041015": "Can't believe you're forced to eat bugs...",
  "str_quest_chat_22041016": "I'm sorry about this...",
  "str_quest_chat_22041017": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_22041018": "How about I take you to eat something nice later when Vice is not around?",
  "str_quest_chat_22041019": "Nice food! I want to go!",
  "str_quest_chat_22041020": "It's a promise!",
  "str_quest_chat_22041021": "Yes, I promise.",
  "str_quest_chat_22101001": "Caelestite, do you have a lucky number?",
  "str_quest_chat_22101002": "A lucky number? What's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_22101003": "It's a number that makes you feel like everything is going your way when it appears around you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22101004": "Can numbers affect your mood?",
  "str_quest_chat_22101005": "Of course. For example, I saw three clouds outside my window when I woke up, so I'll be in a good mood all day long.",
  "str_quest_chat_22101006": "Isn't that all in your head?",
  "str_quest_chat_22101007": "No! Lucky numbers are real! I'm sure you have one, just that you don't know yet!",
  "str_quest_chat_22101008": "I... I guess I have one.",
  "str_quest_chat_22101009": "But it seems like your lucky number is 3...",
  "str_quest_chat_22101010": "Yes!",
  "str_quest_chat_22102001": "Caelestite, the plan you wrote a few days ago was kind of sloppy. Was that a draft?",
  "str_quest_chat_22102002": "Uh... Yes, it was a draft.",
  "str_quest_chat_22102003": "I see. Looking at the draft, I'm guessing that you haven't received much training in this area.",
  "str_quest_chat_22102004": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_22102005": "Writing embodies your thinking process... Scribbling things down here and there will only make you think less logically.",
  "str_quest_chat_22102006": "You need to develop a habit of thinking first before you start writing.",
  "str_quest_chat_22102007": "Indeed...",
  "str_quest_chat_22102008": "You should think carefully before you write.",
  "str_quest_chat_22102009": "I see, in that case, I will practice!",
  "str_quest_chat_22102010": "You can do it, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_22102011": "Show me what you're capable of. This is part of my studies...",
  "str_quest_chat_22103001": "Navigator, don't go to the Colossus for now.",
  "str_quest_chat_22103002": "Why? What's happened in the Colossus? Where are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_22103003": "I'm in the Lounge. Nothing important is happening. Just don't come over here!",
  "str_quest_chat_22103004": "What has happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_22103999": "Siobhan is in the Lounge. Go ask her what's wrong.",
  "str_quest_chat_22104001": "There's a message from Siobhan—",
  "str_quest_chat_22104002": "The concert selection stage has ended. Thank you very much for your participation.",
  "str_quest_chat_22104003": "You must be curious about the results, right, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_22104004": "Sorry to disappoint you, but I failed to pass the selection stage.",
  "str_quest_chat_22104005": "Just as I thought, my singing and dancing still need a lot of work.",
  "str_quest_chat_22104006": "But some people liked me in the auditions and asked me to be a model for them.",
  "str_quest_chat_22104007": "Unfortunately, I was busy with work, so I had to take a rain check.",
  "str_quest_chat_22104008": "Anyway, it was a great experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_22104009": "That settles it! When I return from my quest, we're going for a drink!",
  "str_quest_chat_22141001": "Caelestite! Can I call you that?",
  "str_quest_chat_22141002": "Oh... whatever you prefer.",
  "str_quest_chat_22141003": "You sound like a Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_22141004": "Er... How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_22141005": "I don't think anyone other than Caelestites breaks up their sentences like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_22141006": "Really? I see a lot of people speak like this.",
  "str_quest_chat_22141007": "I've never spent any time with other Caelestites, so I don't know how they speak...",
  "str_quest_chat_22141008": "I see! I finally got more information out of you!",
  "str_quest_chat_22141009": "M-more information out of me?",
  "str_quest_chat_22141010": "Yes! How else would I research Caelestites?",
  "str_quest_chat_22141011": "I mean, they are a race that can pilot something like the Colossus, the crystallization of ancient technology...",
  "str_quest_chat_22141012": "And there are so few of you... so I'll watch you closely.",
  "str_quest_chat_22141013": "... You won't do anything strange, will you?",
  "str_quest_chat_22141014": "You have nothing to worry about. I'm very disciplined.",
  "str_quest_chat_22141015": "Fine, I guess I can only believe you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22142001": "Have you heard any sounds in your room recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_22142002": "Sounds?",
  "str_quest_chat_22142003": "Like, any clicking sounds?",
  "str_quest_chat_22142004": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat_22142005": "Then I think your hearing isn't as sensitive as your psychic ability...",
  "str_quest_chat_22142006": "I need to note this down.",
  "str_quest_chat_22142007": "I guess so...",
  "str_quest_chat_22142008": "Ah, your hearing is as keen as I expected... You're a Caelestite indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_22142009": "What is that sound?",
  "str_quest_chat_22142010": "Don't worry, it's just my eight-legged apprentice. It's very cute.",
  "str_quest_chat_22142011": "Eight-legged... Don't tell me it's a spider or something...",
  "str_quest_chat_22142012": "Are you afraid? Are Caelestites afraid of spiders?",
  "str_quest_chat_22142013": "No, just keep them out of my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_22142014": "Relax, they are very obedient.",
  "str_quest_chat_22142015": "I also don't want them to harass the others...",
  "str_quest_chat_22143001": "Caelestite! I have made a new discovery!",
  "str_quest_chat_22143002": "What discovery?",
  "str_quest_chat_22143003": "You know how I always carry a clipboard with me, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_22143004": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_22143005": "I forgot...",
  "str_quest_chat_22143006": "I think it's made of a material similar to the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_22143007": "What does that mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_22143008": "It seems that even Caelestites don't know very much about the Colossi...",
  "str_quest_chat_22143009": "What's the relationship between this material and ancient technology?",
  "str_quest_chat_22143010": "I have a new topic to study. Can this material reveal the mystery of ancient technology?",
  "str_quest_chat_22143011": "Siobhan?",
  "str_quest_chat_22143012": "I'm off to research the material of the Colossus! Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_22143013": "Oh? I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_22151001": "Oh... Good morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_22151002": "Looks like you're out of energy. Did you stay up late?",
  "str_quest_chat_22151003": "Oh... Not really, I just don't want to get up from bed today.",
  "str_quest_chat_22151004": "That doesn't seem like you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22151005": "If I don't have any work to do... I guess I'm like this.",
  "str_quest_chat_22151006": "You should get some more rest then.",
  "str_quest_chat_22151007": "Oh? How considerate of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22151008": "Anyway, you need to have good work-life balance.",
  "str_quest_chat_22151009": "Mainly because I don't have any topic to research... Should I analyze the material of the Fireflies?",
  "str_quest_chat_22151010": "Go to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_22161001": "Can Fireflies spit webs?",
  "str_quest_chat_22161002": "Er... no.",
  "str_quest_chat_22161003": "Oh, what a pity.",
  "str_quest_chat_22161004": "When I was having lunch, I started wondering if the Fireflies could spit spiderwebs...",
  "str_quest_chat_22161005": "If I modify them like my eight-legged apprentice, don't you think that will improve their motility?",
  "str_quest_chat_22161006": "But there might be technical problems because Fireflies are products of ancient technology...",
  "str_quest_chat_22161007": "Well... You can keep thinking about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_22161008": "Just don't put your thoughts into practice.",
  "str_quest_chat_22162001": "Oh, it's noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_22162002": "Good afternoon, Siobhan.",
  "str_quest_chat_22162003": "Do you want to have a drink together?",
  "str_quest_chat_22162004": "But it's just after noon...",
  "str_quest_chat_22162005": "... I'm bored because there's nothing to research.",
  "str_quest_chat_22162006": "I still have work to do... Please, suits yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_22181001": "Caelestite, what do you do at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_22181002": "If I work until very late, I will just go directly to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_22181003": "I might read a book or zone out to let my brain rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_22181004": "That sounds so ordinary...",
  "str_quest_chat_22181005": "I thought you would have some sort of Caelestite activities.",
  "str_quest_chat_22181006": "Such as dancing while wearing strange masks...",
  "str_quest_chat_22181007": "There's no such things!",
  "str_quest_chat_22182001": "Are you off work yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_22182002": "Oh... I'm never off work.",
  "str_quest_chat_22182003": "Is it because you're always on the Colossus? Just like today?",
  "str_quest_chat_22182004": "Yes, if it's too late, I just sleep at the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_22182005": "I see... You can even research the Bridge while you're there.",
  "str_quest_chat_22182006": "No wonder you're so familiar with the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_22182007": "It's not like that!",
  "str_quest_chat_22183001": "You are still awake...",
  "str_quest_chat_22183002": "Ah, how did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_22183003": "I guessed. I'm stuck on something and need to talk to someone.",
  "str_quest_chat_22183004": "Stuck?",
  "str_quest_chat_22183005": "I was thinking about the materials and mechanics. First of all, there's a contradiction here...",
  "str_quest_chat_22183006": "Not much I can help you with...",
  "str_quest_chat_22184001": "Staying up late, Caelestite?",
  "str_quest_chat_22184002": "Oh, not really. I'm about to go to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_22184003": "It looks like Caelestites enjoy a healthy lifestyle.",
  "str_quest_chat_22184004": "Yes... I have some work to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_22184005": "What about you, Siobhan?",
  "str_quest_chat_22184006": "I'm thinking about something very important.",
  "str_quest_chat_22184007": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_22184008": "\"The correlation between the frequency of staying up late and the intensity of work in Caelestites\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_22184009": "Then I realized I could just ask you directly.",
  "str_quest_chat_22184010": "So, I sent you a message...",
  "str_quest_chat_22184011": "Exactly! I can continue studying now that I have the data!",
  "str_quest_chat_22184012": "Just go to bed. Stop thinking about this...",
  "str_quest_chat_22185001": "G-Good evening...",
  "str_quest_chat_22185002": "Good night?",
  "str_quest_chat_22185003": "My research... is finally over...",
  "str_quest_chat_22185004": "Uh, Siobhan?",
  "str_quest_chat_22185005": "Huh...? Yes, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_22185006": "I get it, you must've had too much to drink.",
  "str_quest_chat_22185007": "You should turn in early.",
  "str_quest_chat_22185008": "#@*%...%...",
  "str_quest_chat_22185009": "Wait, Officer Gronru is in my room...",
  "str_quest_chat_22185010": "Ah... W-What? Another game?",
  "str_quest_chat_22185011": "##%...",
  "str_quest_chat_22185012": "All right...",
  "str_quest_chat_22185013": "Guess I can worry about Siobhan being drunk later...",
  "str_quest_chat_22201001": "After careful consideration, I've decided to regard you as a fellow awakened.",
  "str_quest_chat_22201002": "Oh, really? Thank you...?",
  "str_quest_chat_22201003": "From now on, we're the only two people who know the truth about this world.",
  "str_quest_chat_22201004": "Let's shoulder the responsibility to prevent the invasion of unknown existence and protect the world!",
  "str_quest_chat_22201005": "Uh... Okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_22201006": "As your only awakened companion, I'll make sure I protect you, captain.",
  "str_quest_chat_22201007": "Please remember to not tell others the secret of the awakened.",
  "str_quest_chat_22201008": "This will be a promise between us, captain.",
  "str_quest_chat_22202001": "I've been hearing strange sounds on your Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_22202002": "It must be what I read in the book...",
  "str_quest_chat_22202003": "Uh... what's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_22202004": "It's too difficult to explain with written text. Come over and talk to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22202999": "You're here? Look at my eyes!!",
  "str_quest_chat_22241001": "I've become stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_22241002": "Keep up the momentum.",
  "str_quest_chat_22241003": "Until we become strong enough to fight the unknown existence.",
  "str_quest_chat_22241004": "How strong do we need to be?",
  "str_quest_chat_22241005": "That's a good question.",
  "str_quest_chat_22241006": "Considering that an unknown existence might have defenses stronger than we can imagine...",
  "str_quest_chat_22241007": "Let's assume we need to be strong enough to break through the Colossus in one strike.",
  "str_quest_chat_22241008": "That's impossible!",
  "str_quest_chat_22242001": "To keep becoming stronger is worth celebrating to an awakened one who has been fighting alone.",
  "str_quest_chat_22242002": "But as time passed, I could also feel the looming presence of unknown existence.",
  "str_quest_chat_22242003": "There's no time to waste. From now on, I need to...",
  "str_quest_chat_22242004": "Train?",
  "str_quest_chat_22242005": "Get some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_22242006": "Isn't that the same as wasting time?!",
  "str_quest_chat_22242007": "Caelestite with an ancient bloodline... You're too naive.",
  "str_quest_chat_22242008": "You must get enough rest to have the energy to train.",
  "str_quest_chat_22251001": "Good morning, captain.",
  "str_quest_chat_22251002": "Why are you up so early?!",
  "str_quest_chat_22251003": "I must always be prepared to protect you from the unknown.",
  "str_quest_chat_22251004": "I've been patrolling the Colossus since 2 o'clock in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_22251005": "That must be tough... But I don't think you need to do that...",
  "str_quest_chat_22251006": "With so many Aurorians on board, it's usually quite safe.",
  "str_quest_chat_22251007": "You have a good point. In that case... I'm off to bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_22251008": "I'm so sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_22252001": "Captain, I detected an object approaching your room at a speed of 3 feet per second.",
  "str_quest_chat_22252002": "What?! Is it an Eclipsite attack? Or something else...",
  "str_quest_chat_22252003": "The main components are water, plant fibers, and biological tissues that change their properties when heated.",
  "str_quest_chat_22252004": "Can you say something I understand?",
  "str_quest_chat_22252005": "There's an egg sandwich and some hot tea.",
  "str_quest_chat_22261001": "Captain, if President Florine asks about me, tell her I'm not here.",
  "str_quest_chat_22261002": "What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_22261003": "Don't you two get along with each other?",
  "str_quest_chat_22261004": "President Florine wants to have lunch with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22261005": "And she'll read out the legend of the God of Light in her prayer before she eats.",
  "str_quest_chat_22261006": "I won't be able to stop myself from falling asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_22261007": "You... Can't you try harder to stay awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_22261008": "The power of the unknown existence is beyond my resistance.",
  "str_quest_chat_22261009": "This must be a conspiracy of the God of Light.",
  "str_quest_chat_22261010": "So, please, captain.",
  "str_quest_chat_22262001": "Why must we eat lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_22262002": "Could this also be something designed by the unknown existence?",
  "str_quest_chat_22262003": "That might really be the case.",
  "str_quest_chat_22262004": "I mean, this is something unknown to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22262005": "Of course not!",
  "str_quest_chat_22262006": "We eat to obtain nutrients. It is necessary to grow taller!",
  "str_quest_chat_22262007": "Meals are very important.",
  "str_quest_chat_22262008": "Do you skip meals because of these thoughts?",
  "str_quest_chat_22262009": "No, I'll eat them.",
  "str_quest_chat_22262010": "Because I'll feel hungry if I don't, which will make me weak in battles. This could be a conspiracy of the unknown existence.",

  "str_quest_chat_22342009": "It has been my weapon of choice ever since.",
  "str_quest_chat_22342010": "Only until much later I was told it was actually a relic of explorer Jim.",
  "str_quest_chat_22342011": "Is this why you are determined to become an explorer?",

  "str_quest_chat_22342013": "My bond with the bat has become stronger.",

  "str_quest_chat_22343007": "You lost weight?",
  "str_quest_chat_22343008": "An extreme diet is not good for your health...",
  "str_quest_chat_22343009": "Hmm... For real?",
  "str_quest_chat_22343010": "I didn't realize this...",
  "str_quest_chat_22343011": "I was just guessing.",
  "str_quest_chat_22343012": "Fine. I shouldn't keep you guessing.",
  "str_quest_chat_22343013": "I feel I've grown stronger lately!",

  "str_quest_chat_22352002": "Hmm? Still in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_22352003": "Wake! Up!",

  "str_quest_chat_22353007": "Don't you always wear them on your head?",
  "str_quest_chat_22353008": "Oh, right! Hahahah....",
  "str_quest_chat_22353009": "Just checking if you were really awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_22353010": "I'm not really looking for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_22353011": "You almost got me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22354001": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_22354002": "Hey, I've been waiting and waiting to tell you this!",
  "str_quest_chat_22354003": "It's such a nice day today, perfect for playing baseball!",
  "str_quest_chat_22354004": "Do you want to...",
  "str_quest_chat_22354005": "Morning, Ruby. I just got up.",
  "str_quest_chat_22354006": "What do you want me to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_22354007": "Uh, well, I was going to ask you to play baseball with me, but now...",
  "str_quest_chat_22354008": "I see Rouge already left the room with the gear.",
  "str_quest_chat_22354009": "Hee... Got it.",
  "str_quest_chat_22354010": "You guys have fun!",
  "str_quest_chat_22354011": "Sure! See you!",
  "str_quest_chat_22361001": "Hey, you hungry?",

  "str_quest_chat_22361005": "My hunting trip today was very successful!",
  "str_quest_chat_22361006": "Come and help if you want some meat!",
  "str_quest_chat_22361007": "Sure! I'm on my way...",
  "str_quest_chat_22361008": "Wait a minute... We are not talking about worm meat again, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_22361009": "Is there any problem?",
  "str_quest_chat_22361010": "It just came to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_22361011": "I've already had lunch. I'm not hungry at all.",

  "str_quest_chat_22362003": "May I have a map of the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_22362004": "Map? You mean the floor plan of the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_22362005": "That's exactly what I mean!",
  "str_quest_chat_22362006": "But all Colossus drawings are classified...",
  "str_quest_chat_22362007": "I see... Never mind then!",
  "str_quest_chat_22362008": "I just wanted to explore the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_22362009": "It's actually more exciting without a map!",
  "str_quest_chat_22362010": "Explore the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_22362011": "Promise me you won't bomb the Colossus like all the others!",
  "str_quest_chat_22362012": "Ruby?",
  "str_quest_chat_22362013": "Already on your adventure?",
  "str_quest_chat_22381001": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_22381002": "Good evening, Ruby.",
  "str_quest_chat_22381003": "Today I heard...",
  "str_quest_chat_22381004": "You like to write down your adventures before bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_22381005": "Adventures? Hmm, you could say that...",
  "str_quest_chat_22381006": "Keeping a diary is a habit developed in my childhood.",
  "str_quest_chat_22381007": "So you've been doing this since an early age?",
  "str_quest_chat_22381008": "You must have written many words already!",
  "str_quest_chat_22381009": "Could one of the greatest explorers of our age...",
  "str_quest_chat_22381010": "Be PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_22381011": "Huh? I never thought about becoming an explorer.",
  "str_quest_chat_22382001": "Hi, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_22382002": "You are still up?",
  "str_quest_chat_22382003": "Yes... Just finishing up a few things.",
  "str_quest_chat_22382004": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_22382005": "You've spent the whole day in your room. Aren't you bored?",
  "str_quest_chat_22382006": "I wanted to check on you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22382007": "This is nothing for me. Don't you remember?",
  "str_quest_chat_22382008": "I spent 17 years under the ground.",
  "str_quest_chat_22382009": "Hahahahah. Almost forgot!",
  "str_quest_chat_22382010": "Don't stay up too late. Good night!",

  "str_quest_chat_22401002": "It usually won't get close to anyone but me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22401003": "Did you steal its heart with any strange food?",
  "str_quest_chat_22401004": "Not at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_22401005": "A quick denial, which makes you even more suspicious.",
  "str_quest_chat_22401006": "Take a guess?",
  "str_quest_chat_22401007": "But is there anything on Soroz it could feed on?",
  "str_quest_chat_22401008": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_22401009": "Nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_22401010": "I have changed my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_22401011": "It's particularly close to you probably just because you have spent quite some time together.",
  "str_quest_chat_22402001": "Caelestite, I need to see you in the cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_22402002": "Uhh? What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_22402003": "I don't have time to explain now.",
  "str_quest_chat_22402004": "But I promise I'll tell you after.",

  "str_quest_chat_22441008": "I'll study the situation and destroy it if necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat_22441009": "Err... I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_22441010": "For real.",
  "str_quest_chat_22441011": "Caelestite, don't neglect this matter.",
  "str_quest_chat_22441012": "Ancient technologies can be extremely dangerous.",
  "str_quest_chat_22442001": "Since I started assisting you in various missions, I have become stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_22442002": "Is this one of your powers?",
  "str_quest_chat_22442003": "I dare not take the credit.",
  "str_quest_chat_22442004": "You have worked hard for this yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_22442005": "Your great efforts are paying off.",
  "str_quest_chat_22442006": "And your potential has been stimulated.",
  "str_quest_chat_22442007": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_22442008": "Well, I appreciate your approval.",
  "str_quest_chat_22442009": "At the same time, I'd like to point out how marvelous a Navigator you are!",

  "str_quest_chat_22443004": "I wish we didn't have to fight so much...",
  "str_quest_chat_22443005": "Then you better get yourself stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_22443006": "That's the only way to protect what we truly care about.",
  "str_quest_chat_22443007": "Yes... I understand it all too well.",
  "str_quest_chat_22443008": "From now on...",
  "str_quest_chat_22443009": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_22443010": "Drink more hot water.",
  "str_quest_chat_22443011": "Okay... Uhh?",

  "str_quest_chat_22451006": "Since you are already up, put on some clothes and get to work.",

  "str_quest_chat_22461003": "That's no good. Come and eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_22461004": "Don't worry. I'm not hungry right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_22461005": "Without lunch, you won't be able to focus, and your efficiency will suffer the whole afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_22461006": "I can't let that happen.",

  "str_quest_chat_22561003": "I believe there is lunch for you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22561004": "A lunch without grilled meat is like a person without a soul.",
  "str_quest_chat_22561005": "Grilled meat... That's difficult.",
  "str_quest_chat_22561006": "If you don't have meat, I can hunt some for you.",

  "str_quest_chat_22561008": "My Blazing Epee can help you.",

  "str_quest_chat_22561011": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_22562001": "Hey. Are you sleeping your day away?",
  "str_quest_chat_22562002": "Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_22562003": "Good. Give me a list.",
  "str_quest_chat_22562004": "A list of what?",
  "str_quest_chat_22562005": "What have those people from Illumina fixed on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_22562006": "Make me a list of all the parts!",
  "str_quest_chat_22562007": "Err... You want to learn Illumina's technology?",
  "str_quest_chat_22562008": "What are you talking about? Is that how weak you think I am?",
  "str_quest_chat_22562009": "Ruby would misunderstand me if she saw this!",
  "str_quest_chat_22562010": "I just don't want those Illumina fellas to steal the entire show....",
  "str_quest_chat_22562011": "I decide to redo all the repair for you for free!",
  "str_quest_chat_22562012": "... I appreciate your help. I really do!",
  "str_quest_chat_22563001": "Hey, have you seen my...",
  "str_quest_chat_22563002": "Your what?",
  "str_quest_chat_22563003": "This is annoying, I've been looking for it the whole morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_22563004": "What did you lose? Slow down and tell me, I'll tell the Fireflies to keep an eye out.",
  "str_quest_chat_22563005": "It's the rubber band I use to tie my hair...",
  "str_quest_chat_22563006": "A loose strand of hair is distracting me from doing repairs!",
  "str_quest_chat_22563007": "Think carefully, where did you leave it?",
  "str_quest_chat_22563008": "At the cafe? The restaurant?",
  "str_quest_chat_22563009": "Maybe the lounge?",
  "str_quest_chat_22563010": "Rouge...?",
  "str_quest_chat_22563011": "Rouge!",
  "str_quest_chat_22563012": "Oh, sorry, I left for a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat_22563013": "I, uh, found it.",
  "str_quest_chat_22563014": "It's in Ruby's room.",
  "str_quest_chat_22563015": "It's alright now...",
  "str_quest_chat_22563016": "Go ahead and take your break! Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_22563017": "...Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_22564001": "It's time for lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_22564002": "It's not like I care or anything...",
  "str_quest_chat_22564003": "But since your Fireflies helped me find Ruby, I just thought I'll check in on you a little.",
  "str_quest_chat_22564004": "Haha, as expected, it's about Ruby again.",
  "str_quest_chat_22564005": "D-don't laugh!!",
  "str_quest_chat_22581001": "It's late.",
  "str_quest_chat_22581002": "Would you think about someone before bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_22581003": "You seem a bit different tonight...",
  "str_quest_chat_22581004": "You become sentimental all of a sudden...",
  "str_quest_chat_22581005": "I'm not! I just don't have much to talk with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22581006": "Ahhh. That's not exactly what I mean...",
  "str_quest_chat_22581007": "I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_22581008": "Hmm?",
  "str_quest_chat_22581009": "Many people have someone on their mind before bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_22581010": "If you think hard enough...",
  "str_quest_chat_22581011": "You might see the person in your dream.",
  "str_quest_chat_22581012": "I better sleep now. Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_22581013": "Night.",
  "str_quest_chat_22601001": "Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_22601002": "What do you know about priestesses?",

  "str_quest_chat_22601006": "Are all priestesses like you?",
  "str_quest_chat_22601007": "Different priestesses have different personalities.",
  "str_quest_chat_22601008": "But we all have one thing in common...",
  "str_quest_chat_22601009": "All priestesses are girls.",
  "str_quest_chat_22601010": "Aww, it's not for me then...",
  "str_quest_chat_22601011": "I just wanted to say...",
  "str_quest_chat_22601012": "I'll take care of all the spiritual matters on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_22601013": "Don't trouble anyone else with it. Would that be okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_22601014": "Sure... I'm counting on you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22601015": "Though I'm not sure what kind of spiritual matters you're referring to...?",

  "str_quest_chat_22602003": "Everything is fine. I just want to tell you that...",
  "str_quest_chat_22602004": "If you feel down and have no appetite...",
  "str_quest_chat_22602005": "Come to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22602006": "Huh? You know medical stuff as well?",
  "str_quest_chat_22602007": "I want to perform a healing dance for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22602008": "Or play a healing song.",
  "str_quest_chat_22602009": "You'll feel better after.",
  "str_quest_chat_22602010": "Sounds fun!",
  "str_quest_chat_22602011": "Can I watch you perform now?",
  "str_quest_chat_22602012": "I'm afraid not. The healing dance and song...",
  "str_quest_chat_22602013": "Can only be performed for people who are ill.",
  "str_quest_chat_22602014": "For the very first time, I'm looking forward to getting ill...",
  "str_quest_chat_22603001": "I'm sorry. I didn't receive your message earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_22603002": "Ah, no big deal.",
  "str_quest_chat_22603003": "Yao sent me some specialties of Cloud Island. We'd love to share them with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22603004": "That's very kind of you... But I'm busy praying.",
  "str_quest_chat_22603005": "I'll come as soon as I'm done here, is that okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_22603006": "Of course. We'll be at the Cafe.",

  "str_quest_chat_22641003": "I don't ask for a lot...",
  "str_quest_chat_22641004": "All I need is some food and water.",
  "str_quest_chat_22641005": "If you would allow me to practice dancing and playing my instruments as well...",
  "str_quest_chat_22641006": "That would be even better.",
  "str_quest_chat_22641007": "Hey, this is entirely my pleasure!",
  "str_quest_chat_22641008": "If I get to see you dance, then I'm the lucky one.",
  "str_quest_chat_22641009": "By the way, I've done some clerical work as well...",
  "str_quest_chat_22641010": "Hopefully I can give you a hand on this.",
  "str_quest_chat_22641011": "Thank you but...",
  "str_quest_chat_22641012": "Work on the Colossus can get a little messy. And you're busy with your practice.",

  "str_quest_chat_22642002": "I made an incredible discovery recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_22642003": "What was it?",
  "str_quest_chat_22642004": "I've gotten better at dancing and playing instruments!",
  "str_quest_chat_22642005": "I'm so happy for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_22642006": "You worked hard for this!",
  "str_quest_chat_22642007": "No, I only got better after I met you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22642008": "For a very long time, I thought...",
  "str_quest_chat_22642009": "My techniques were already perfect.",
  "str_quest_chat_22642010": "But since I started spending time with you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22642011": "I started to get better.",
  "str_quest_chat_22642012": "You really think there's a connection...?",
  "str_quest_chat_22642013": "Perhaps it's because you have a strong spiritual aura around you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22642014": "Anyway, thank you very much!",
  "str_quest_chat_22642015": "Please allow me to stay by your side.",
  "str_quest_chat_22642016": "It's a pleasure having you around.",

  "str_quest_chat_22643002": "Are you the god of the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_22643003": "Uhh? Me? I'm just an average Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_22643004": "So all Caelestites can control Colossi?",
  "str_quest_chat_22643005": "I heard Caelestites are gifted with special talents...",
  "str_quest_chat_22643006": "But not all of us can control Colossi.",
  "str_quest_chat_22643007": "But you can, can't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_22643008": "That's true...",
  "str_quest_chat_22643009": "No wonder I'm getting better just by being around you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22643010": "Sorry it took me so long to realize that you are the god of the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_22643011": "No, I'm not a...",
  "str_quest_chat_22643012": "You got me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22643013": "But please, don't tell anyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_22643014": "If you prefer to keep it a secret, I'll respect your decision.",
  "str_quest_chat_22643015": "After all, I'm a priestess, a servant of the gods.",

  "str_quest_chat_22651006": "Really.",
  "str_quest_chat_22651007": "You know... I could send fireflies to do this.",
  "str_quest_chat_22651008": "Cleaning is part of my meditation.",
  "str_quest_chat_22651009": "I really think you should try it one day.",
  "str_quest_chat_22651010": "Yeah, one day...",
  "str_quest_chat_22651011": "I don't think that'll be necessary...",
  "str_quest_chat_22652001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_22652002": "Emm... Are you still resting?",
  "str_quest_chat_22652003": "Mor... Morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_22652004": "Great! You're up already.",
  "str_quest_chat_22652005": "Did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_22652006": "If you lie in bed for too long, you'll become a ghost.",
  "str_quest_chat_22652007": "Because eventually...",
  "str_quest_chat_22652008": "The sheets will stick to your body, and you'll never be able to get them off!",
  "str_quest_chat_22652009": "So, how would the priestess deal with such an unfortunate soul?",
  "str_quest_chat_22652010": "Well, you could guess. Or...",
  "str_quest_chat_22652011": "I could show you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22653001": "Another peaceful morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_22653002": "What's the plan?",
  "str_quest_chat_22653003": "Hmm... What should I do?",
  "str_quest_chat_22653004": "Work, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_22653005": "Oh? Didn't know you were so diligent.",
  "str_quest_chat_22653006": "I just want to enjoy this beautiful morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_22653007": "Good idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_22653008": "In that case, I'll pray for the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_22653009": "I'll provide you with a safe and comfy environment.",
  "str_quest_chat_22653010": "Well, that's a bit dramatic...",
  "str_quest_chat_22654001": "Good morning, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_22654002": "Morning, Rinne.",
  "str_quest_chat_22654003": "Everything is colorful and radiant in the early morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_22654004": "The hues flash and fade, showing off different aspects of nature every second.",
  "str_quest_chat_22654005": "If you can, consider rising up early...",

  "str_quest_chat_22654007": "Okay, got it...",
  "str_quest_chat_22654008": "Have a nice day.",
  "str_quest_chat_22661001": "Good afternoon, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_22661002": "Good afternoon, Rinne.",
  "str_quest_chat_22661003": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_22661004": "Yeah. Why do you ask?",
  "str_quest_chat_22661005": "Did you notice today's lunch tasted better than usual?",
  "str_quest_chat_22661006": "... Why are you asking?",
  "str_quest_chat_22661007": "Not yet. Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_22661008": "I prayed to the god of food.",
  "str_quest_chat_22661009": "Hopefully the food on the Colossus will become better and better...",
  "str_quest_chat_22661010": "I only hope the god of food will forgive us.",
  "str_quest_chat_22661011": "We do some terrible things to the food here...",
  "str_quest_chat_22662001": "I heard you like to take a break at noon?",
  "str_quest_chat_22662002": "Yeap.",
  "str_quest_chat_22662003": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_22662004": "What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_22662005": "I myself don't have that habit.",
  "str_quest_chat_22662006": "But I do sit and meditate in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_22662007": "It's a great way to restore energy...",
  "str_quest_chat_22662008": "And it helps me sort through my thoughts.",
  "str_quest_chat_22662009": "What is that position you're sitting in?",
  "str_quest_chat_22662010": "Basically, I kneel on the floor and sit on my ankles.",
  "str_quest_chat_22662011": "You kneel on your ankles? Doesn't that hurt?",
  "str_quest_chat_22662012": "Or... Is this also part of your training?",
  "str_quest_chat_22662013": "That's one way of putting it. Phew.",
  "str_quest_chat_22681001": "Please excuse me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22681002": "It's late. What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_22681003": "I wanted to ask...",
  "str_quest_chat_22681004": "Did you take a shower?",
  "str_quest_chat_22681005": "Why do you want to know?",
  "str_quest_chat_22681006": "Of course I did.",
  "str_quest_chat_22681007": "Good. That's better.",
  "str_quest_chat_22681008": "Washing before bed is a good habit.",
  "str_quest_chat_22681009": "Good night then.",
  "str_quest_chat_22681010": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_22681011": "What? Are you going to sleep like this?",
  "str_quest_chat_22681012": "Is-Is there a problem?",
  "str_quest_chat_22681013": "Not washing is very disrespectful to the people around you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22681014": "I sleep alone anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_22681015": "You're hopeless.",
  "str_quest_chat_22681016": "Don't get upset. I'll take a shower right now. But hey...",
  "str_quest_chat_22681017": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_22682001": "Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_22682002": "You're still up?",
  "str_quest_chat_22682003": "Tonight feels very bleak for some reason.",
  "str_quest_chat_22682004": "Are you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22682005": "Thinking about the people you can't see again?",
  "str_quest_chat_22682006": "How did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_22682007": "Whenever I think about my people...",
  "str_quest_chat_22682008": "The night tends to feel very long and cold...",
  "str_quest_chat_22682009": "I hate to admit that we are the same.",
  "str_quest_chat_22682010": "I should go to bed. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_22682011": "*Sighs* Is it that bad to be the same as me?",
  "str_quest_chat_22701001": "Those things told me the Navigator is a good person.",
  "str_quest_chat_22701002": "Err... Thanks, I guess?",
  "str_quest_chat_22701003": "I should thank you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22701004": "I had no place to call my own on Cloud Island.",
  "str_quest_chat_22701005": "If I hadn't come here...",
  "str_quest_chat_22701006": "I don't know where I'd go.",
  "str_quest_chat_22701007": "Thank you for taking me in.",
  "str_quest_chat_22701008": "You don't even care if I can afford the rent here...",
  "str_quest_chat_22701009": "Nobody pays rent here anyway...",
  "str_quest_chat_22701010": "So don't worry about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_22702001": "I really enjoy life on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_22702002": "It's even better than on Cloud Island...",
  "str_quest_chat_22702003": "I'm so glad you're enjoying yourself here!",
  "str_quest_chat_22702004": "I'd like to repay your kindness somehow...",
  "str_quest_chat_22702005": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_22702006": "That really won't be necessary. I'm only doing what's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_22702007": "Please allow me to do something for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_22702008": "If you insist...",
  "str_quest_chat_22702009": "Really, it's okay. Just don't stalk me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22702010": "I'm not Rinne. And I don't plan to become like her...",
  "str_quest_chat_22702011": "As long as you don't send the ghosts my way.",
  "str_quest_chat_22702012": "I'm a little scared of them...",
  "str_quest_chat_22702013": "Anything else should be fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_22702014": "Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat_22702015": "I'll think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_22702016": "Just give me some time...",
  "str_quest_chat_22703001": "I... I have a favor to ask.",
  "str_quest_chat_22703002": "Go ahead. I'm all ears.",
  "str_quest_chat_22703003": "It's hard to say through the terminal...",
  "str_quest_chat_22703004": "Could you please come to the Cafe?",
  "str_quest_chat_22703999": "Kayano has a favor to ask and is waiting at the Cafe. Talk to her now.",
  "str_quest_chat_22741001": "Those things have become more obedient...",
  "str_quest_chat_22741002": "They used to be irascible and restless.",
  "str_quest_chat_22741003": "Whenever I got scared, they would attack everything nearby.",
  "str_quest_chat_22741004": "But that rarely happens now.",
  "str_quest_chat_22741005": "I can even ask them to protect everyone...",
  "str_quest_chat_22741006": "How did this happen?",
  "str_quest_chat_22741007": "It's because those things want to keep you safe.",
  "str_quest_chat_22741008": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_22741009": "They don't want you to be scared either.",
  "str_quest_chat_22741010": "So they work hard to help.",
  "str_quest_chat_22741011": "So that's how it is?",
  "str_quest_chat_22751001": "Good morning, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_22751002": "Hi... Morning, Kayano.",
  "str_quest_chat_22751003": "You look a bit down...",
  "str_quest_chat_22751004": "I had a bad dream last night.",
  "str_quest_chat_22751005": "In the dream, I was chased by Eclipsites all night...",
  "str_quest_chat_22751006": "When I woke up this morning, I was exhausted.",
  "str_quest_chat_22751007": "When you're having a nightmare, try to open your eyes...",
  "str_quest_chat_22751008": "That way you'll wake up right away.",
  "str_quest_chat_22751009": "Those things taught me that...",
  "str_quest_chat_22761001": "The midday sun is very hot.",
  "str_quest_chat_22761002": "Those things hate sunshine...",
  "str_quest_chat_22761003": "Would some sunscreen help?",
  "str_quest_chat_22761004": "It's not like I can put the sunscreen on them...",
  "str_quest_chat_22761005": "How about an umbrella?",
  "str_quest_chat_22761006": "I'm too tall. The umbrella always hits the ceiling...",
  "str_quest_chat_22761007": "What about the lounge?",
  "str_quest_chat_22761008": "The lounge never gets too hot, even at noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_22761009": "It's the perfect spot for an afternoon nap!",
  "str_quest_chat_22761010": "Perfect for a nap...",
  "str_quest_chat_22761011": "I'll check it out.",
  "str_quest_chat_22781001": "It's night already...",
  "str_quest_chat_22781002": "This is the best time to get things done.",
  "str_quest_chat_22781003": "You're not going to sleep, Kayano?",
  "str_quest_chat_22781004": "I slept during the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_22781005": "There are so many people on the Colossus during the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_22781006": "I'm a little scared to go out...",
  "str_quest_chat_22781007": "Don't worry about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_22781008": "Some of the people on the Colossus can be a little odd...",
  "str_quest_chat_22781009": "But they're not bad guys or anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_22781010": "If you decide to go out one day...",
  "str_quest_chat_22781011": "I'm sure everyone would love to meet you!",
  "str_quest_chat_22781012": "Hmm... Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22782001": "A lot of kids come to me to play hide-and-seek.",
  "str_quest_chat_22782002": "They want me to pretend to be a ghost...",
  "str_quest_chat_22782003": "That sounds like fun.",
  "str_quest_chat_22782004": "Congratulations on making new friends!",
  "str_quest_chat_22782005": "Thank you. I'm so happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_22782006": "But our game is often cut short...",
  "str_quest_chat_22782007": "When I find them, they...",
  "str_quest_chat_22782008": "They what?",
  "str_quest_chat_22782009": "They run away in tears.",
  "str_quest_chat_22782010": "Crying, \"Help! Ghost!\"",
  "str_quest_chat_22783001": "The white Colossus floats in the night sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_22783002": "Kayano?",
  "str_quest_chat_22783003": "Master of the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_22783004": "Kayano?!",
  "str_quest_chat_22783005": "How does it feel to look down upon all living creatures?",
  "str_quest_chat_22783006": "Hehe...",
  "str_quest_chat_22783007": "Are you okay!?",
  "str_quest_chat_22783008": "Heheheh...",
  "str_quest_chat_22783009": "Ah!",
  "str_quest_chat_22783010": "I'm sorry, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_22783011": "I lost control of those things earlier...",
  "str_quest_chat_22783012": "So ghosts can send messages nowadays...",
  "str_quest_chat_22783013": "They're really keeping up with the times...",
  "str_quest_chat_22784001": "Good evening, Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_22784002": "Evening, Kayano.",
  "str_quest_chat_22784003": "You're staying up?",
  "str_quest_chat_22784004": "Yes. I already got enough sleep during the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_22784005": "But don't worry...",
  "str_quest_chat_22784006": "I'll be vigilant and make sure those things don't disturb your sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_22784007": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_22784008": "It's okay, Kayano.",
  "str_quest_chat_22784009": "Those things don't bother me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22784010": "O-Okay!",
  "str_quest_chat_22784011": "Rest well, then, esteemed Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_22784012": "...Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_22784013": "Hmm. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_22785001": "Eve... Evening... PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_22785002": "There... There's something I've been meaning to tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22785003": "I-I'm the one who took the taiyaki from the fridge...",
  "str_quest_chat_22785004": "B-because, there were too many people in the kitchen in the daytime! I'm really, really sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat_22785005": "It's okay, Kayano.",
  "str_quest_chat_22785006": "Just let me know next time and I'll have the Fireflies send some up to your room.",
  "str_quest_chat_22785007": "... You, you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22785008": "As they say, you really are a good person.",
  "str_quest_chat_22785009": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22801001": "What kind of sounds do you like?",
  "str_quest_chat_22801002": "Sounds? Not music?",
  "str_quest_chat_22801003": "Sounds.",
  "str_quest_chat_22801004": "If I must say then... the sounds of nature?",
  "str_quest_chat_22801005": "Bird chirps and such.",
  "str_quest_chat_22801006": "Just like me. I also enjoy the sounds of nature very much.",
  "str_quest_chat_22801007": "Especially the rustle of winds rushing through fields of rice. How refreshing and pleasant.",
  "str_quest_chat_22801008": "It brings back memories from my childhood... a sound that used to accompany me to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_22801009": "Yes, sounds like that are soothing and comforting.",
  "str_quest_chat_22801010": "A pity that those days didn't last...",
  "str_quest_chat_22801011": "Luckily, I've discovered another way of falling asleep. Living here...",
  "str_quest_chat_22801012": "The beds here are so comfy...",
  "str_quest_chat_22802001": "Do you know much about ninjutsu?",
  "str_quest_chat_22802002": "A little.",
  "str_quest_chat_22802003": "If so, what do you think is the most important in ninjutsu?",
  "str_quest_chat_22802004": "The different ninjutsu encantations?",
  "str_quest_chat_22802005": "Hmm... Those are quite important, but that's the technical part.",
  "str_quest_chat_22802006": "Hard training and talent?",
  "str_quest_chat_22802007": "For sure, but those things are not unique to ninjutsu.",
  "str_quest_chat_22802008": "What do you think is the most important then, Amemori?",
  "str_quest_chat_22802009": "Patience, that is to say, the strength to endure.",
  "str_quest_chat_22802010": "You possess this type of strength.",
  "str_quest_chat_22802011": "Me?",
  "str_quest_chat_22802012": "Yes, you lived alone under the ground for 17 years. With such endurance...",
  "str_quest_chat_22802013": "I think you have great potential in ninjutsu!",
  "str_quest_chat_22802014": "Is this a compliment...?",
  "str_quest_chat_22803001": "Excuse me, may I borrow the Lounge?",
  "str_quest_chat_22803002": "I guess so. But what for?",
  "str_quest_chat_22803003": "It's open and spacious, perfect for my ninja training.",
  "str_quest_chat_22803004": "Please don't peep at me while I'm practicing.",
  "str_quest_chat_22803999": "Amemori is doing special ninja training in the Lounge. It's fine to take a peep, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_22841001": "Hello. I am Amemori.",
  "str_quest_chat_22841002": "My lord...?",
  "str_quest_chat_22841003": "As the ruler of this Colossus, you deserve to be addressed respectfully.",
  "str_quest_chat_22841004": "I'm just an ordinary Caelestite. That's not necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat_22841005": "Anyway... Welcome to the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_22841006": "You have been calling it a Colossus. So...",
  "str_quest_chat_22841007": "Is it a Behemoth or what others would call an aircraft?",
  "str_quest_chat_22841008": "Both.",
  "str_quest_chat_22841009": "Now I'm confused.",
  "str_quest_chat_22841010": "You can see it as an flying Behemoth.",
  "str_quest_chat_22841011": "Can it feel pain?",
  "str_quest_chat_22841012": "If my shuriken hits it by accident...",
  "str_quest_chat_22841013": "Would it hurt?",
  "str_quest_chat_22841014": "Yes, so please try not to hit him.",
  "str_quest_chat_22842001": "What do you think of me after all this time we've been acquainted?",
  "str_quest_chat_22842002": "You are someone of great endurance.",
  "str_quest_chat_22842003": "What about my personality?",
  "str_quest_chat_22842004": "Err... A little...",
  "str_quest_chat_22842005": "Cold...",
  "str_quest_chat_22842006": "You're very strong, but a bit...",
  "str_quest_chat_22842007": "Cold?",
  "str_quest_chat_22842008": "Yes, just a little...",
  "str_quest_chat_22842009": "I see. So that's how you see me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22842010": "Are you upset?",
  "str_quest_chat_22842011": "No, you are right about me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22842012": "Amemori, you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22842013": "But I don't mind it at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_22842014": "Maybe I just don't have any personality. That's why even when I'm smiling at people...",
  "str_quest_chat_22842015": "Have you not noticed?",
  "str_quest_chat_22842016": "N-No, I haven't.",
  "str_quest_chat_22843001": "I've finally figured out the truth behind the nine-word mantra of ninjutsu!",
  "str_quest_chat_22843002": "Nine-word mantra?",
  "str_quest_chat_22843003": "What? You haven't heard of it?",
  "str_quest_chat_22843004": "Err... I'm afraid not.",
  "str_quest_chat_22843005": "It sounds familiar but I can't recall.",
  "str_quest_chat_22843006": "Rin, Pyo, Toh, Sha, Kai, Jin, Retsu, Zai, Zen!",
  "str_quest_chat_22843007": "It sounds like some kind of chant or spell.",
  "str_quest_chat_22843008": "It's an encantation, a very powerful one.",
  "str_quest_chat_22843009": "Chant it in a special way with unique gestures.",
  "str_quest_chat_22843010": "And you can cast enough power to blow up this Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_22843011": "Please... Please don't do it here!",
  "str_quest_chat_22851001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_22851002": "Morning, Amemori. You're up early.",
  "str_quest_chat_22851003": "How rare to see you up this early. What are you up to?",
  "str_quest_chat_22851004": "Nothing much.",
  "str_quest_chat_22851005": "Hmmm... You seem pretty free.",
  "str_quest_chat_22851006": "I'm inspecting the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_22851007": "As expected, you're working hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_22851008": "Hold on!",
  "str_quest_chat_22851009": "Amemori, why are you suddenly interested in my morning activities?",
  "str_quest_chat_22851010": "Nothing... Don't worry about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_22852001": "Morning is a good time for practicing calligraphy.",
  "str_quest_chat_22852002": "Oh?",
  "str_quest_chat_22852003": "Because it's very peaceful and no one will disturb you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22852004": "Ah... I shall leave you to it. Please continue.",
  "str_quest_chat_22852005": "It's alright, I'm already finished.",
  "str_quest_chat_22852006": "I finished while you were all asleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_22852007": "Oh... That must've been before dawn...",
  "str_quest_chat_22861001": "Ah, it's already noon. Please tell Fireflies not to send me food today.",
  "str_quest_chat_22861002": "Okay. You're planning to take a nap?",
  "str_quest_chat_22861003": "No, I am going to train.",
  "str_quest_chat_22861004": "The timing and the state of my body are perfectly in sync right now for this ninjutsu training...",
  "str_quest_chat_22861005": "Please don't disturb me or I don't know what might happen.",
  "str_quest_chat_22861006": "Okay. I'll keep that in mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_22861007": "Make sure the Fireflies don't come here!",
  "str_quest_chat_22862001": "I heard you eat a lot at lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_22862002": "Not all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_22862003": "You need better self-control. Too big a lunch means a sleepy afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_22862004": "And you'll gain weight, which isn't good for hiding or prowling...",
  "str_quest_chat_22862005": "Amemori... your standards are too much for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22862006": "After all, I'm not a ninja...",
  "str_quest_chat_22863001": "The Colossus is busy this time of day.",
  "str_quest_chat_22863002": "Having lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_22863003": "I already finished.",
  "str_quest_chat_22863004": "Chilling on the bridge?",
  "str_quest_chat_22863005": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_22863006": "I'm currently observing your passengers from the window in silence.",
  "str_quest_chat_22863007": "It is bustling, Aurorians mingling freely with each other...",
  "str_quest_chat_22863008": "What a very pleasant afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_22863009": "So pleasant, someone is snoring in the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat_22863010": "Who is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_22863011": "I'm afraid you'll have to see for yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_22863012": "Good afternoon. Time for me to practice.",
  "str_quest_chat_22863013": "Good afternoon. Guess I got work to do, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_22863014": "I'll send the fireflies to check it out.",
  "str_quest_chat_22881001": "What does evening mean to you?",
  "str_quest_chat_22881002": "Why do you suddenly ask?",
  "str_quest_chat_22881003": "Hmm... Rest?",
  "str_quest_chat_22881004": "What about you, Amemori?",
  "str_quest_chat_22881005": "Evening means opportunity.",
  "str_quest_chat_22881006": "How so?",
  "str_quest_chat_22881007": "Breaking in, snooping, reconnaissance... I did these often at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_22881008": "I kind of miss the feeling of walking alone outside at night...",
  "str_quest_chat_22881009": "You don't need to do this on the Colossus. You should go rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_22882001": "I wonder, are dinners supposed to be rich and heavy?",
  "str_quest_chat_22882002": "That depends on individual preference.",
  "str_quest_chat_22882003": "I see many ordinary families get together at night...",
  "str_quest_chat_22882004": "Sitting around, sharing a big dinner merrily.",
  "str_quest_chat_22882005": "That's right. I heard that at those types of gatherings...",
  "str_quest_chat_22882006": "Even the most common dishes taste much more delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat_22882007": "Really? If I ever get the chance, I must experience it.",
  "str_quest_chat_22901001": "Ah! Such a great day!",
  "str_quest_chat_22901002": "Hmm? What happened today?",
  "str_quest_chat_22901003": "I had some really nice duck and crispy pastry today!",
  "str_quest_chat_22901004": "And my armguard, Warrior's Legacy, got updated with new silk!",
  "str_quest_chat_22901005": "So silky and smooth, it totally brings my training to a whole new level!",
  "str_quest_chat_22901006": "Yao's happiness is so simple...",
  "str_quest_chat_22901007": "Huh? This sounds...",
  "str_quest_chat_22901008": "So did you have a bad day? Or does happiness not come to you so easily?",

  "str_quest_chat_22901010": "Someone had a fight on the Colossus again!",
  "str_quest_chat_22901011": "I'm so mad about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_22901012": "Happiness is never simple",
  "str_quest_chat_22901013": "Too much work on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_22901014": "Deployment arranging, budget checking, resource examining...",
  "str_quest_chat_22901015": "To be happy, I need to get the work done first.",
  "str_quest_chat_22901016": "Hmm... In that case, let me share my happiness with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_22901017": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_22901018": "I'm super happy today because I made two perfect hair buns.",
  "str_quest_chat_22901019": "And I got to see you!",
  "str_quest_chat_22901020": "T-That's all?",
  "str_quest_chat_22901021": "Yes, it's very hard to get two hair buns symmetrical, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat_22902001": "Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_22902002": "Hmm? How come you seem kind of down?",
  "str_quest_chat_22902003": "I... Can I be straightfoward with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_22902004": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_22902005": "I heard someone speak badly about you outside today.",
  "str_quest_chat_22902006": "They were talking about how you're so famous even though you're so weak, and how your reputation isn't deserved.",
  "str_quest_chat_22902007": "They also questioned if you were actually a Caelestite...",
  "str_quest_chat_22902008": "I... I was so mad! I punched them in their faces right away!",
  "str_quest_chat_22902009": "Uhh... Thank you, Yao, for defending me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22902010": "But it's not really a big deal to me. Their words can't hurt me.",
  "str_quest_chat_22902011": "But it hurts me!",
  "str_quest_chat_22902012": "That's why I made them do squats while shouting a slogan.",
  "str_quest_chat_22902013": "... What slogan?",
  "str_quest_chat_22902014": "\"Caelestites are lovely! Caelestites are wonderful! Caelestites are the best!\"",
  "str_quest_chat_22902015": "O... Okay... Thank you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22902016": "Please just ignore them if this happens again.",
  "str_quest_chat_22903001": "Ahh...",
  "str_quest_chat_22903002": "I had a dream, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_22903003": "In my dream, you and I were traveling around together, upholding justice and helping those in need...",
  "str_quest_chat_22903004": "And we cooked for each other?",
  "str_quest_chat_22903005": "T-Then...",
  "str_quest_chat_22903006": "I'm kinda interested in knowing what happened next...",
  "str_quest_chat_22903007": "Eh... I can't bring myself to tell you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22903008": "I promise I won't laugh. And it'll be a secret between us!",
  "str_quest_chat_22903009": "Something unusual happened, didn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_22903010": "It was quite unusual...",
  "str_quest_chat_22903011": "What exactly happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_22903012": "I ate three lunchboxes filled to the brim...",
  "str_quest_chat_22903013": "But you only had three chicken legs.",
  "str_quest_chat_22903014": "Then I kicked you.",
  "str_quest_chat_22903015": "... It was a very gentle kick though, very very gentle!",
  "str_quest_chat_22903016": "... That's all?!",
  "str_quest_chat_22903017": "Uhh? You don't find it odd? I kicked you!",
  "str_quest_chat_22903018": "I thought there would be a talking rock or something...",
  "str_quest_chat_22903019": "Hmm... That does sound fascinating indeed!",
  "str_quest_chat_22903020": "I might dream about it tonight!",
  "str_quest_chat_22903021": "Can't wait to hear all about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_22904001": "Last time we ended with my acquisition of the Records on Customs.",
  "str_quest_chat_22904002": "It's a book about regional customs and foods.",
  "str_quest_chat_22904003": "According to the book...",
  "str_quest_chat_22904004": "You started a food tour.",
  "str_quest_chat_22904005": "Woah. You're pretty cultured!",
  "str_quest_chat_22904006": "... Is this a compliment?",
  "str_quest_chat_22904007": "Haha. Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_22904008": "Meet me in the Cafe, and we'll continue with the story.",
  "str_quest_chat_22904009": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_22904999": "Yao is waiting for you in the Cafe... What story will she tell you this time? Go meet her and find out.",
  "str_quest_chat_22941001": "Mmm... I'm hungry...",
  "str_quest_chat_22941002": "You came all the way to the Colossus without eating?",
  "str_quest_chat_22941003": "That's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_22941004": "So, what's good here?",
  "str_quest_chat_22941005": "Regular bento boxes aren't bad.",
  "str_quest_chat_22941006": "As for the other Aurorians' cooking...",
  "str_quest_chat_22941007": "I wouldn't recommend trying them.",
  "str_quest_chat_22941008": "Eh? You don't think they cook well?",
  "str_quest_chat_22941009": "What ingredients do we have here then? I'm a pretty decent cook.",
  "str_quest_chat_22941010": "... Oh, really?",
  "str_quest_chat_22941011": "You don't look convinced.",
  "str_quest_chat_22941012": "B-Because I've been told similar things before...",
  "str_quest_chat_22941013": "All our ingredients are in the Warehouse and kitchen. Help yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_22941014": "I'll take a look and have a tour of the Colossus while I'm at it!",
  "str_quest_chat_22941015": "Sure. Do you need some company?",
  "str_quest_chat_22941016": "That won't be necessary. It's more interesting to explore the place on my own!",
  "str_quest_chat_22942001": "This strength flowing through my body...",
  "str_quest_chat_22942002": "What's going on? Could it be that you're not a Navigator but a...",
  "str_quest_chat_22942003": "A Luminatics master?",
  "str_quest_chat_22942004": "Ahh! No wonder you keep pretending you don't know anything about Luminatics.",
  "str_quest_chat_22942005": "You... You're trying to lure more talents to your side to strengthen your school of Luminatics!",
  "str_quest_chat_22942006": "Oops... I didn't mean to blow your secret...",
  "str_quest_chat_22942007": "Ahem. Trust me. We martial artists are pretty good at keeping secrets.",
  "str_quest_chat_22942008": "I won't share this with anyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_22942009": "...?",
  "str_quest_chat_22942010": "What? It's only been a few minutes since I checked the terminal the last...",
  "str_quest_chat_22942011": "Hey! Yao! You got it all wrong!",
  "str_quest_chat_22951001": "Morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_22951002": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_22951003": "Hehe. Would you like to try some chili oil milk?",
  "str_quest_chat_22951004": "Did they modify the Colossus breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_22951005": "I think I'll pass. It sounds horrible.",
  "str_quest_chat_22951006": "Woah! Is this the fantastic Psychic Ability I keep hearing about?",
  "str_quest_chat_22951007": "It does taste very bad!",
  "str_quest_chat_22951008": "... Not surprised.",
  "str_quest_chat_22952001": "Time for some morning exercise!",
  "str_quest_chat_22952002": "I just heard something outside...",
  "str_quest_chat_22952003": "It came from rather far away, got closer, and then drew away again...",
  "str_quest_chat_22952004": "Were you practicing kicks while walking?!",
  "str_quest_chat_22952005": "Yes! I was!",
  "str_quest_chat_22952006": "It's hard to imagine that the human body is capable of such strange of movements...",
  "str_quest_chat_22952007": "What's hard to imagine is that some people are still in bed at this hour!",
  "str_quest_chat_22953001": "Woah! There's a new steamed bun diner in Koufu-jou!",
  "str_quest_chat_22953002": "Navigator, would you like to go with me some time?",
  "str_quest_chat_22953003": "I remember getting broth all over my face last time we had buns.",
  "str_quest_chat_22953004": "We're not getting the small buns with broth in them this time!",
  "str_quest_chat_22953005": "I lost the filling last time we had big ones.",
  "str_quest_chat_22953006": "... Err...",
  "str_quest_chat_22953007": "Maybe steamed buns and you aren't meant for each other. Hahah...",
  "str_quest_chat_22954001": "Morning, morning, morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_22954002": "Good morning, Yao.",
  "str_quest_chat_22954003": "I'm envious of how you always seem to have boundless energy.",
  "str_quest_chat_22954004": "Me? Boundless energy?",
  "str_quest_chat_22954005": "That's probably because I ate five big buns this morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_22954006": "Want some? They're delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_22954007": "Thanks, but I already had breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_22954008": "How about next time?",
  "str_quest_chat_22954009": "That works too! I just checked and there were none left, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_22954010": "So why did you offer?",
  "str_quest_chat_22954011": "Well, I forgot I only made five.",
  "str_quest_chat_22961001": "Mapo tofu with rice is so expensive in Astra...",
  "str_quest_chat_22961002": "How much did they charge you?",
  "str_quest_chat_22961003": "I gave them everything I had...",
  "str_quest_chat_22961004": "And I spent the whole morning washing dishes for them.",
  "str_quest_chat_22961005": "Poor you...",
  "str_quest_chat_22961006": "*Sob*",
  "str_quest_chat_22961007": "There, there. Maybe you could try to cook your own food?",
  "str_quest_chat_22961008": "... Woah! That's a really good idea!",
  "str_quest_chat_22962001": "%￥%%...&...",
  "str_quest_chat_22962002": "Yao? What are you trying to say?",
  "str_quest_chat_22962003": "￥%%#￥@#...",
  "str_quest_chat_22962004": "Yao? Are you alright? Do you need help?",
  "str_quest_chat_22962005": "Yao?!",
  "str_quest_chat_22962006": "Ah! I'm fine, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_22962007": "I had an accident during my exercise. Heheh.",
  "str_quest_chat_22962008": "... I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_22963001": "So hungry... Why am I so hungry all the time?",
  "str_quest_chat_22963002": "Maybe because you train a lot?",
  "str_quest_chat_22963003": "Hmm... Everyone else on the Colossus is so slim!",
  "str_quest_chat_22963004": "But I think I'm happier when I eat to my heart's content, haha.",
  "str_quest_chat_22963005": "Right! That's a good way of looking at it.",
  "str_quest_chat_22981001": "Hiya!",
  "str_quest_chat_22981002": "Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_22981003": "Good evening, Yao.",
  "str_quest_chat_22981004": "You look really happy today.",
  "str_quest_chat_22981005": "Yes! Because I sharpened my hairpin today.",
  "str_quest_chat_22981006": "It's much sharper now!",
  "str_quest_chat_22981007": "I'm one step closer to becoming a warrior who kills without leaving a trace. Heheh.",
  "str_quest_chat_22981008": "That sounds impressive!",
  "str_quest_chat_22981009": "Of course! Ahem... I shouldn't brag though.",
  "str_quest_chat_22981010": "Err... I think it's time for you to go to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_22981011": "Hmm. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_23001001": "Thank you so much for your help!",
  "str_quest_chat_23001002": "Hmm? What help?",
  "str_quest_chat_23001003": "Hmm? So great wits really do have short memories?",
  "str_quest_chat_23001004": "Could it be...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23001005": "Oh, you mean the flyer?",
  "str_quest_chat_23001006": "You asked me to help put up a flyer for Kaniya Ramen on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_23001007": "That was nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_23001008": "You mean that time we prepared ingredients together?",
  "str_quest_chat_23001009": "I only separated the meat from the veggies...",
  "str_quest_chat_23001010": "I really didn't help much.",
  "str_quest_chat_23001011": "Oh, it's not that.",
  "str_quest_chat_23001012": "We received some parts from the Fireflies this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_23001013": "After investigating them, we discovered...",
  "str_quest_chat_23001014": "They were replacements for the broken parts of our POS machine.",
  "str_quest_chat_23001015": "We only mentioned it in passing yesterday, but you actually remembered...",
  "str_quest_chat_23001016": "It's really no big deal.",
  "str_quest_chat_23001017": "We'll take care of your meals over the next few days for free!",
  "str_quest_chat_23001018": "Really?!",
  "str_quest_chat_23001019": "That's really kind of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23002001": "Our honored guest, are you free today?",
  "str_quest_chat_23002002": "Not really...",
  "str_quest_chat_23002003": "Ah! What a pity!",
  "str_quest_chat_23002004": "For now...",
  "str_quest_chat_23002005": "But that might change at any second.",
  "str_quest_chat_23002006": "Someone might start a fight or set fire to the Colossus again at any moment...",
  "str_quest_chat_23002007": "I'm always on standby to deal with problems!",
  "str_quest_chat_23002008": "We didn't know you were this busy!",
  "str_quest_chat_23002009": "... So, what did you have planned?",
  "str_quest_chat_23002010": "We wanted you to be manager for a day at our ramen cart!",
  "str_quest_chat_23002011": "But I can't really cook.",
  "str_quest_chat_23002012": "That's perfectly fine!",
  "str_quest_chat_23002013": "We heard the food on the Colossus is rather dreadful...",
  "str_quest_chat_23002014": "So we were planning to teach you to cook a few dishes.",
  "str_quest_chat_23002015": "That way you can prepare good meals for yourself!",
  "str_quest_chat_23002016": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_23002017": "Haha. Thank you for your consideration, but that won't be necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat_23002018": "The food on the Colossus is nothing like your cooking...",
  "str_quest_chat_23002019": "But it's good enough!",
  "str_quest_chat_23003001": "Has our honored guest eaten yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_23003002": "There's something we need to discuss with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_23003003": "Is it about food?",
  "str_quest_chat_23003004": "Yes! Please meet us in the Rec Room!",
  "str_quest_chat_23003999": "Momo and Anzu are waiting for me in the Rec Room. Better go see what's up.",
  "str_quest_chat_23041001": "Did you hear that sound?",
  "str_quest_chat_23041002": "Huh? What sound?",
  "str_quest_chat_23041003": "We'll mimic it for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23041004": "Swish, swish...",
  "str_quest_chat_23041005": "... What kind of sound is that? The wind?",
  "str_quest_chat_23041006": "Huh? You still don't get it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23041007": "It's the sound of a knife being sharpened!",
  "str_quest_chat_23041008": "We noticed that our combat power has increased of late.",
  "str_quest_chat_23041009": "So we figured we'd need to sharpen our tools as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_23041010": "That sounds a little frightening...",
  "str_quest_chat_23041011": "Don't worry. This is for the kitchen only.",
  "str_quest_chat_23041012": "Hmm... Let's try it out.",
  "str_quest_chat_23041013": "High-spirited!",
  "str_quest_chat_23051001": "Morning! We made spicy meat buns today!",
  "str_quest_chat_23051002": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_23051003": "Spicy meat filling... That sounds delicious!",
  "str_quest_chat_23051004": "Sorry, they're already sold out!",
  "str_quest_chat_23051005": "Business is good, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_23051006": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_23051007": "We know what you're thinking. We'll save one for you next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_23051008": "Heheh. Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_23052001": "Our new menu is out today!",
  "str_quest_chat_23052002": "Morning. So you've got some new ideas?",
  "str_quest_chat_23052003": "You could say that!",
  "str_quest_chat_23052004": "In order to run a successful business, you need to offer new products every now and then.",
  "str_quest_chat_23052005": "Such as our limited-edition double-bun combo!",
  "str_quest_chat_23052006": "It's a set menu that includes crab roe buns and creamy custard buns...",
  "str_quest_chat_23052007": "Get your sweet tooth and savory craving taken care of at once!",
  "str_quest_chat_23052008": "That does sound pretty good.",
  "str_quest_chat_23053001": "We're open for business!",
  "str_quest_chat_23053002": "Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_23053003": "Don't tell me you're still in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_23053004": "We're already back from catching crabs!",
  "str_quest_chat_23053005": "C-Catching crabs?!",
  "str_quest_chat_23053006": "We gather our own ingredients!",
  "str_quest_chat_23053007": "Becoming a master chef is much harder than you think it is!",
  "str_quest_chat_23053008": "If you have to get up this early to become one...",
  "str_quest_chat_23053009": "Then I think I'll pass.",
  "str_quest_chat_23054001": "The saying was right!",
  "str_quest_chat_23054002": "If you want to be healthy!",
  "str_quest_chat_23054003": "Start with a healthy breakfast!",
  "str_quest_chat_23054004": "So what's the next line...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23054005": "Nothing comes to mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_23054006": "Err...",
  "str_quest_chat_23054007": "Grow tall and strong?",
  "str_quest_chat_23054008": "Hey, that's good!",
  "str_quest_chat_23054009": "We think you got a knack for poetry!",
  "str_quest_chat_23054010": "... Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23055001": "Ramen?",
  "str_quest_chat_23055002": "Ramen!",
  "str_quest_chat_23055003": "What's for breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_23055004": "Ramen, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_23055005": "What do you think of our new marketing slogan, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_23055006": "Excellent!",
  "str_quest_chat_23055007": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_23055008": "It's pretty catchy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23055009": "Great, we're good to go then!",
  "str_quest_chat_23055010": "Bye then!",
  "str_quest_chat_23061001": "Has our honored guest had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_23061002": "I did. Why do you ask?",
  "str_quest_chat_23061003": "We're doing a survey!",
  "str_quest_chat_23061004": "To find out when and how everyone eats on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_23061005": "We've worked hard on it!",
  "str_quest_chat_23061006": "No wonder your business is doing so well.",
  "str_quest_chat_23061007": "Psh. It's an essential step towards becoming master chefs.",
  "str_quest_chat_23081001": "I bet you have no idea what we are doing!",
  "str_quest_chat_23081002": "Oh no! You've triggered my inner competitiveness!",
  "str_quest_chat_23081003": "You must be preparing ingredients!",
  "str_quest_chat_23081004": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat_23081005": "You're making late night snacks!",
  "str_quest_chat_23081006": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat_23081007": "You're... Fine, I give up.",
  "str_quest_chat_23081008": "Hahaha! We're making a lantern!",
  "str_quest_chat_23081009": "Some fool knocked out the lantern from our ramen cart today.",
  "str_quest_chat_23081010": "Now we have to make one to replace it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23081011": "... What kind of guessing game was that supposed to be?!",
  "str_quest_chat_23081012": "Come on! We were just a little bored.",
  "str_quest_chat_23081013": "Done! Time for bed! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_23081014": "...Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_23101001": "I heard there were amazing artists on this big flying ship.",
  "str_quest_chat_23101002": "Since you're a Caelestite, you must have a flair for art too.",
  "str_quest_chat_23101003": "I was hoping to discuss the creation of \"Al***my St**s\" with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23101004": "If you're interested, I'll be at the cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_23101999": "A Mysterious Creature says that it wants to discuss something with me and is waiting at the cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_23201001": "How rare to see you anywhere away from the bridge!",
  "str_quest_chat_23201002": "What's the matter? I'll be there shortly.",
  "str_quest_chat_23201003": "You better hurry.",
  "str_quest_chat_23201004": "Don't keep me waiting.",
  "str_quest_chat_23201999": "I don't know what exactly Azure wants but I better go to the bridge to find out.",
  "str_quest_chat_23202001": "Wanna know a mini game I've been enjoying lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_23202002": "A racing game?",
  "str_quest_chat_23202003": "A shooting game?",
  "str_quest_chat_23202004": "Incorrect.",
  "str_quest_chat_23202005": "I can imagine the silly, dazed look on your face from just your voice...",
  "str_quest_chat_23202006": "I'll just tell you the answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_23202007": "The game I've been enjoying lately is people watching in the Colossus cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_23202008": "People watching?",
  "str_quest_chat_23202009": "There are just so many cute-looking folks around, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat_23202010": "Err...",
  "str_quest_chat_23202011": "Are you trying to pick up one of my friends?",
  "str_quest_chat_23202012": "Oh? Jealous, are we?",
  "str_quest_chat_23202013": "Definitely not!",
  "str_quest_chat_23202014": "Well if you want, I can direct all my attention towards you instead.",
  "str_quest_chat_23202015": "I-I already said I don't—",
  "str_quest_chat_23202016": "I'm hanging up!",
  "str_quest_chat_23202017": "Heh... The upset Caelestite is pretty cute.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203001": "Hey, good-looking!",
  "str_quest_chat_23203002": "... Hello, Azure.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203003": "Hmm... That doesn't sound like a \"good to see you\" hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203004": "How would you like to be addressed, kiddo?",
  "str_quest_chat_23203005": "I... Argh!",
  "str_quest_chat_23203006": "If I say something like, \"I'm not a kid\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_23203007": "Or \"I'm grown up\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_23203008": "I would sound stupidly childish!",
  "str_quest_chat_23203009": "It's also quite childish to speak your mind out loud.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203010": "Urgh...",
  "str_quest_chat_23203011": "My, my... Let me think.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203012": "What foolish things did those kids in the past do to prove to me that they'd grown up?",
  "str_quest_chat_23203013": "Hmm... There were too many to remember, but one of them left an impression on me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203014": "To prove that he was no longer a child, no longer afraid of pain...",
  "str_quest_chat_23203015": "He got a tattoo around his eye just like mine.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203016": "Ouch... That sounds super painful...",
  "str_quest_chat_23203017": "Scared? Heh... Still a kid indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203018": "There's no need to rush to grow up. Isn't it nice to be young?",
  "str_quest_chat_23203019": "It's not about growing up...",
  "str_quest_chat_23203020": "I... I want to become stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203021": "Strong enough to protect the things that are important to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203022": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_23203023": "I'm familiar with that sort of feeling.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203024": "Well, I'm very experienced when it comes to honing skills.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203025": "Want me to give you some guidance?",
  "str_quest_chat_23203026": "It you don't mind!",
  "str_quest_chat_23203027": "Hmm... Private lessons with just the two of us. Sounds lovely.",
  "str_quest_chat_23203028": "Something doesn't sound right...",
  "str_quest_chat_23241001": "Aww... Is this where the Caelestite lives?",
  "str_quest_chat_23241002": "And these flying little guys are Fireflies?",
  "str_quest_chat_23241003": "They're so small and adorable, just like you!",
  "str_quest_chat_23241004": "Adorable...",
  "str_quest_chat_23241005": "*Cough* Welcome to Soroz, Azure.",
  "str_quest_chat_23241006": "Hmm... The floor here feels different than on Lepidoz...",
  "str_quest_chat_23241007": "Er... I don't think there's anything special about it...",
  "str_quest_chat_23241008": "Solid and strong but very light. Perhaps that's because it was meant to fly.",
  "str_quest_chat_23241009": "You should know your ride inside and out, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_23241010": "I wonder how the floor would fare if you shot at it or drove a car across it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23241011": "I'd prefer it if you didn't do that...",
  "str_quest_chat_23242001": "My rifle has been serviced better than ever.",
  "str_quest_chat_23242002": "It has a very charming scent now...",
  "str_quest_chat_23242003": "Really? What kind of scent is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23242004": "A bold, rusty note with traces of cold gunpowder, followed by...",
  "str_quest_chat_23242005": "Followed by your unique body odor.",
  "str_quest_chat_23242006": "My... My body odor?",
  "str_quest_chat_23242007": "I never even touched your gun...",
  "str_quest_chat_23242008": "We've spent so much time with you, it has started to smell like you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23242009": "It's not a bad thing, not at all. Actually, it's helping it aim better than ever.",
  "str_quest_chat_23242010": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_23242011": "So, my... body odor, it's not too bad, is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23242012": "Heheh... I love it!",
  "str_quest_chat_23242013": "That's good to hear...",
  "str_quest_chat_23243001": "Phew...",
  "str_quest_chat_23243002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_23243003": "Are you alright? What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_23243004": "I just went for a ride.",
  "str_quest_chat_23243005": "I barely hit the brakes at all going downhill...",
  "str_quest_chat_23243006": "That sounds very dangerous!",
  "str_quest_chat_23243007": "Are you worried about me?",
  "str_quest_chat_23243008": "It's a common technique in the Rediesel Wrench.",
  "str_quest_chat_23243009": "I know you're very good at this...",
  "str_quest_chat_23243010": "Yes, I'm very worried!",
  "str_quest_chat_23243011": "Life isn't always about looking good and feeling awesome!",
  "str_quest_chat_23243012": "Mmm... What should I do then?",
  "str_quest_chat_23243013": "I'm so touched to hear that you care about me. I suppose I'll listen to you this once.",
  "str_quest_chat_23243014": "Just once?",
  "str_quest_chat_23243015": "Yes, don't get greedy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23243016": "I might change my mind any second. How about we tie you to the passenger seat and enjoy the fast changing scenery together?",
  "str_quest_chat_23243017": "Please don't...",
  "str_quest_chat_23251001": "Morning, babe.",
  "str_quest_chat_23251002": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_23251003": "Hm, you don't seem to mind me calling you sweetheart.",
  "str_quest_chat_23251004": "I... I...",
  "str_quest_chat_23251005": "I don't really know how to respond.",
  "str_quest_chat_23251006": "Do you need a lessons on that as well? Well, it's kind of fun to train you to my liking...",
  "str_quest_chat_23251007": "You could say...",
  "str_quest_chat_23251008": "\"Morning to you too, sweetheart.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_23251009": "... Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_23251010": "Cough... I uh, I have to go now!",
  "str_quest_chat_23251011": "Oh my, is that all you can handle?",
  "str_quest_chat_23252001": "The Colossus is flying at a perfect speed.",
  "str_quest_chat_23252002": "Stand on the bridge and feel the wind with your body...",
  "str_quest_chat_23252003": "If you close your eyes, you'll feel something like happiness.",
  "str_quest_chat_23252004": "I imagine you're still asleep, so I'm leaving you this message.",
  "str_quest_chat_23252005": "This way, you'll be able to enjoy this wonderful feeling when you wake up.",
  "str_quest_chat_23252006": "Morning. Have a lovely day.",
  "str_quest_chat_23261001": "Fancy a drink with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_23261002": "Sorry, not now...",
  "str_quest_chat_23261003": "I have some matters to deal with.",
  "str_quest_chat_23261004": "Drink... Drink what?",
  "str_quest_chat_23261005": "What would you like me to give you to drink, Caelestite?",
  "str_quest_chat_23261006": "I... I don't know...",
  "str_quest_chat_23261007": "Heheh. Just kidding.",
  "str_quest_chat_23261008": "It got you excited for a second, right? Alas, you're still too young for adult beverages.",
  "str_quest_chat_23262001": "It's so hot today!",
  "str_quest_chat_23262002": "Good afternoon, Azure.",
  "str_quest_chat_23262003": "It's not that bad on the Colossus. Where are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_23262004": "In my car.",
  "str_quest_chat_23262005": "Are you inviting me to your Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_23262006": "Mmm... Then it'd get pretty heated on the Colossus, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_23262007": "I... I just thought it'd be more comfortable on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_23262008": "Heh... So it is an invitation...",
  "str_quest_chat_23262009": "Thank you. That's very sweet of you but I'd rather be by myself right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_23262010": "I might take you up on your offer next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_23263001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23263002": "Ah. The lunch here isn't bad.",
  "str_quest_chat_23263003": "You had lunch on the Colossus today?",
  "str_quest_chat_23263004": "That's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_23263005": "I've been to many places for work and tried all kinds of food. It's not so easy to impress me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23263006": "I'm glad you liked it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23263007": "I didn't cook it but I'm just glad.",
  "str_quest_chat_23263008": "So when will I have the honor to try PlayerName's cooking?",
  "str_quest_chat_23263009": "I... I'll do my best!",
  "str_quest_chat_23263010": "Heheh. Do your best to win over my stomach? You'll definitely make someone lucky one day.",
  "str_quest_chat_23263011": "A-A... Wait, as in marriage?!",
  "str_quest_chat_23264001": "Little Caelestite!",
  "str_quest_chat_23264002": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_23264003": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_23264004": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_23264005": "Oh? You didn't stammer this time!",
  "str_quest_chat_23264006": "That's a little frustrating, actually...",
  "str_quest_chat_23264007": "How about this?",
  "str_quest_chat_23264008": "Why don't I feed you some more of your drink? Intimately.",
  "str_quest_chat_23264009": "N... no, no... t-that won't be necessary!",
  "str_quest_chat_23264010": "See? That's more like it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23281001": "Hah! Good evening!",
  "str_quest_chat_23281002": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_23281003": "That was cold.",
  "str_quest_chat_23281004": "Someone doesn't want to talk. Is there someone special waiting for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_23281005": "I... I thought you were going to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_23281006": "Haha. I only use good night as a polite greeting.",
  "str_quest_chat_23281007": "You're also a night owl?",
  "str_quest_chat_23281008": "Hmm... That depends.",
  "str_quest_chat_23281009": "Though I would really love to just say yes so we could talk all night...",
  "str_quest_chat_23281010": "You're still a growing Caelestite who needs to get plenty of sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_23281011": "So today, let us bid each other a real good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_23281012": "Night, Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_23281013": "Night...",
  "str_quest_chat_23282001": "It's already so late...",
  "str_quest_chat_23282002": "Yeah... Ah...",
  "str_quest_chat_23282003": "It's Azure! Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_23282004": "Someone sounds sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23282005": "I'm okay... What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_23282006": "Nothing much.",
  "str_quest_chat_23282007": "Just had a great day hunting is all, it was wonderful.",
  "str_quest_chat_23282008": "I wanted to tell you about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23282009": "That sounds wonderful!",
  "str_quest_chat_23282010": "Miss Azure, this time... *Snore*",
  "str_quest_chat_23282011": "Ahh... I'm so sorry, I promise I'm listening!",
  "str_quest_chat_23282012": "Heh, never mind. I suddenly realize...",
  "str_quest_chat_23282013": "The sight of you nodding off in front of me is much more amusing than any prey running for life.",
  "str_quest_chat_23282014": "W-What...",
  "str_quest_chat_23282015": "Nothing. Good night. Sleep tight, kiddo.",
  "str_quest_chat_23301001": "Do you have a moment, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_23301002": "Interested in helping me test my new invention?",
  "str_quest_chat_23301003": "It's a very well-paid job. All you need to do is to record some data during my testing.",
  "str_quest_chat_23301004": "Find me in the Lounge if you're interested.",
  "str_quest_chat_23301999": "Roy's looking for an assistant for his experiment. It's a well paid position, let's go check it out.",
  "str_quest_chat_23302001": "By the way, what do you think about joining the Blazing Rally?",
  "str_quest_chat_23302002": "The Blazing Rally? What's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_23302003": "Those little brats in the Rediesel Wrench hang out with you so much but never invited you to the rally?",
  "str_quest_chat_23302004": "To put it simply, it's a race where there are no rules other than to complete it alive.",
  "str_quest_chat_23302005": "I don't know much about car racing...",
  "str_quest_chat_23302006": "But a race without rules doesn't sound very safe...",
  "str_quest_chat_23302007": "Driving and trying to sabotage each other at the same time is part of the fun.",
  "str_quest_chat_23302008": "You really attack each other?!",
  "str_quest_chat_23302009": "I have to say, I'm not really surprised. It's the Rediesel Wrench, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_23302010": "It sounds dangerous but somewhat tempting...",
  "str_quest_chat_23302011": "How does one join the race?",
  "str_quest_chat_23302012": "It's an annual event. This year's race is already finished.",
  "str_quest_chat_23302013": "If you really want to take a joy ride with us...",
  "str_quest_chat_23302014": "A lot of things happened. I don't even know where to begin...",
  "str_quest_chat_23302015": "But as a whole... It was an unforgettable experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_23302016": "The doll I won still sits proudly on my bookshelf.",
  "str_quest_chat_23302017": "This is your handiwork, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23302018": "How...",
  "str_quest_chat_23302019": "How come even you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_23302020": "The Rediesel Wrench is one thing, they're all family, but you... What was even the point of remaining anonymous?",
  "str_quest_chat_23302021": "Why do you want to keep it a secret?",
  "str_quest_chat_23302022": "Err... Emm... You see...",
  "str_quest_chat_23302023": "These dolls are very popular among collectors.",
  "str_quest_chat_23302024": "It's not about popularity...",
  "str_quest_chat_23302025": "... Well... Since you already know...",
  "str_quest_chat_23302026": "You'll just have to join the Rediesel Wrench.",
  "str_quest_chat_23302027": "Why is that?!",
  "str_quest_chat_23341001": "PlayerName, I have something to discuss with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23341002": "What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_23341003": "You've been taking good care of me. I'm very grateful.",
  "str_quest_chat_23341004": "However, if we think about resource efficiency...",
  "str_quest_chat_23341005": "Opportunities are better given to those younger ones with great potential, as opposed to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23341006": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_23341007": "Of course, I don't mean I'm just going to sit around doing nothing. I'll still help out whenever I can.",
  "str_quest_chat_23341008": "But I'm not getting any younger. I can't keep up anymore...",
  "str_quest_chat_23341009": "You're a really capable fighter though.",
  "str_quest_chat_23341010": "I used to be, but that's all in the past.",
  "str_quest_chat_23341011": "Don't worry about it. I got this!",
  "str_quest_chat_23341012": "I'll improve my leadership skills...",
  "str_quest_chat_23341013": "So we can finish our battles before your stamina runs out.",
  "str_quest_chat_23341014": "You... Gosh. You'll be a force to be reckoned with one day.",
  "str_quest_chat_23341015": "Now I have no choice but to give my best...",
  "str_quest_chat_23342001": "I've been thinking, and I really want to thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342002": "For what?",
  "str_quest_chat_23342003": "I've been feeling young and spry in battle lately, like I've returned to my younger self.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342004": "I owe this to your leadership and patience.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342005": "Your younger self...",
  "str_quest_chat_23342006": "Hahah! Hard to imagine?",
  "str_quest_chat_23342007": "It used to be a piece of cake to handle an enemy camp all by myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342008": "You handled an enemy camp all alone?",
  "str_quest_chat_23342009": "Right! Zeta brought this up before.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342010": "The protagonist of this story... who was it again...",
  "str_quest_chat_23342011": "A one-eyed, crippled lone wolf?",
  "str_quest_chat_23342012": "Was... Was that it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23342013": "Those little ones needed a bedtime story every single night, but there aren't enough books in the world to accomodate them. So I ended up adapting some real life events into fairytales.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342014": "Ah, but don't misunderstand, both of my eyes are perfectly fine. This is just an old habit.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342015": "It helps me quickly adapt to changes in light in dark environments and gain the upper hand in battle.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342016": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_23342017": "I've learned a lot from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342018": "... I miss these kind of conversations.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342019": "You... Sound just like him.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342020": "Who?",
  "str_quest_chat_23342021": "... Nothing. Forget about it. It's a bad habit of mine.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342022": "PlayerName is PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23342023": "I look forward to receiving your guidance from now on.",
  "str_quest_chat_23351001": "Morning, youngster!",
  "str_quest_chat_23351002": "Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_23351003": "You sound listless...",
  "str_quest_chat_23351004": "I know staying up late isn't good for my health.",
  "str_quest_chat_23351005": "But there are so many things to do... *Yawn*",
  "str_quest_chat_23351006": "I heard those who are not satisfied with their day tend to stay up late...",
  "str_quest_chat_23351007": "Can you help me?",
  "str_quest_chat_23351008": "Let me think. Staying up late is indeed bad for the health...",
  "str_quest_chat_23351009": "Why not just pull an all-nighter then?",
  "str_quest_chat_23351010": "That's a really weird suggestion!",
  "str_quest_chat_23361001": "Don't forget lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_23361002": "Ah! Almost forgot.",
  "str_quest_chat_23361003": "... Oh no.",
  "str_quest_chat_23361004": "Vice said she was gonna test out a new recipe today...",
  "str_quest_chat_23361005": "Speaking of, I find the ingredients at Rediesel Wrench very strange...",
  "str_quest_chat_23361006": "But you always manage to make decent food.",
  "str_quest_chat_23361007": "Aww... You really think so? That makes me happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23361008": "I can't really taste anything other than sweetness...",
  "str_quest_chat_23361009": "But as long as you follow a recipe, you'll get a decent result.",
  "str_quest_chat_23361010": "Why doesn't this seem to apply to Vice?",
  "str_quest_chat_23362001": "I got something for you. Your Fireflies will bring it to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23362002": "I received it already. It was efreshing vanilla tea, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23362003": "Yes. Also, I helped fix a few Fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat_23362004": "Thank you so much... Um, I'm a little curious about something.",
  "str_quest_chat_23362005": "Is there anything you're not good at?",
  "str_quest_chat_23362006": "Hmm... Dancing, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat_23362007": "One time someone came up with this awful idea...",
  "str_quest_chat_23362008": "We were to dress up as dancing girls to sneak into a bandit den for a surprise attack.",
  "str_quest_chat_23362009": "I drew the lucky number and had to spend all night learning a dance routine, but I was still a burden for the troupe in the end...",
  "str_quest_chat_23362010": "A troupe of dancing girls...",
  "str_quest_chat_23362011": "Desert Flower. Have you heard the name? They're quite famous in our region.",
  "str_quest_chat_23362012": "An old man like you managed to blend in?",
  "str_quest_chat_23362013": "Come on! I was once a handsome young fellow.",
  "str_quest_chat_23362014": "Those idiots were too drunk to tell the difference anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_23362015": "It was so hard to kick someone in high heels. I don't know how Azure can do it so easily...",
  "str_quest_chat_23362016": "Ah sorry, someone's looking for me. I'll have to cut our chat short.",
  "str_quest_chat_23362017": "I'm kinda curious what happened after...",
  "str_quest_chat_23363001": "Good day, young one.",
  "str_quest_chat_23363002": "Good afternoon, Roy!",
  "str_quest_chat_23363003": "You...",
  "str_quest_chat_23363004": "Haven't been forced to be a princess today, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_23363005": "Geez, you sure have a good memory when it comes to things like this.",
  "str_quest_chat_23363006": "Those brats will be the death of me!",
  "str_quest_chat_23363007": "I'm surprised you have time to chat.",
  "str_quest_chat_23363008": "Well, just finished dealing with the mess that gang of brats made...",
  "str_quest_chat_23363009": "So I thought I'd pop by and see how you were doing.",
  "str_quest_chat_23363010": "... I'm not a brat!",
  "str_quest_chat_23363011": "If you say so, haha.",
  "str_quest_chat_23364001": "Afternoon there, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_23364002": "Afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_23364003": "This old man is going to go get a little shut-eye.",
  "str_quest_chat_23364004": "You kids should pay more attention to your health.",
  "str_quest_chat_23364005": "I was just about to rest for awhile, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_23364006": "It's a good practice. Keep at it!",
  "str_quest_chat_23364007": "Haha, I'll do my best.",
  "str_quest_chat_23364008": "Right, see you then.",
  "str_quest_chat_23364009": "Yup, rest well.",
  "str_quest_chat_23381001": "One must rest well at night to grow tall and strong.",
  "str_quest_chat_23381002": "Why are you saying that out of nowhere?",
  "str_quest_chat_23381003": "I saw light in your room just now as I passed by. Still up?",
  "str_quest_chat_23381004": "The Snowland Ballad is so good... I didn't realize it was already this late...",
  "str_quest_chat_23381005": "Wait! What I meant to ask was...",
  "str_quest_chat_23381006": "You think I can still grow taller?",
  "str_quest_chat_23381007": "Aren't you only 17? Don't give up on yourself too early.",
  "str_quest_chat_23381008": "Can I grow as tall as you?",
  "str_quest_chat_23381009": "Well... It's not always good to be so tall.",
  "str_quest_chat_23381010": "When you're legs are too long, you can never stretch them out in cramped spaces. Plus you hit your head all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_23381011": "On the bright side, you're easily spotted in a large crowd.",
  "str_quest_chat_23381012": "All of this sounds like bragging to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_23381013": "Well, the secret to growing tall is the same as that to defeating a powerful enemy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23381014": "Sleep well. Eat well. And exercise well!",
  "str_quest_chat_23381015": "Hmm... That sounds really simple...",
  "str_quest_chat_23381016": "But I shouldn't aim too high... I'll focus on the first two first.",
  "str_quest_chat_23381017": "Good night, Roy. Thanks for the tips.",
  "str_quest_chat_23381018": "Night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23382001": "Are you there, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_23382002": "Yes?",
  "str_quest_chat_23382003": "Listen. I don't mean to be a busybody...",
  "str_quest_chat_23382004": "Is there something you want to tell me?",
  "str_quest_chat_23382005": "It's nothing major...",
  "str_quest_chat_23382006": "I just want to remind you to wash your face with hot water before shaving.",
  "str_quest_chat_23382007": "And it's better to shave in one direction evenly.",
  "str_quest_chat_23382008": "Don't rush it. Patience is the key here.",
  "str_quest_chat_23382009": "This way your chin won't ever suffer again.",
  "str_quest_chat_23382010": "You... saw everything?",
  "str_quest_chat_23382011": "Err... I saw you earlier on the bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_23382012": "I shouldn't have said anything...",
  "str_quest_chat_23382013": "It's fine!",
  "str_quest_chat_23382014": "Actually... Thank you...",
  "str_quest_chat_23382015": "Ahahah... That's a relief. You're welcome.",
  "str_quest_chat_23401001": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_23401002": "Lenore saw a curious stuffed toy in the warehouse today.",
  "str_quest_chat_23401003": "How? What kind of stuffed toy?",
  "str_quest_chat_23401004": "Lenore thought it was a frog at first, then a bat... but it also looked like a spider.",
  "str_quest_chat_23401005": "Oh, it must be the Windelion Doll I made the last time...",
  "str_quest_chat_23401006": "I'm sorry. That was a failed attempt.",
  "str_quest_chat_23401007": "Failed attempt? But Lenore finds it nice.",
  "str_quest_chat_23401008": "Lenore couldn't come up with a shape that makes no sense like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_23401009": "Lenore really admires how creative PlayerName is.",
  "str_quest_chat_23401010": "Can Lenore make a few Windelion Dolls like that and try to sell them?",
  "str_quest_chat_23401011": "Ugh... Sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_23401012": "But I don't think people would buy them at all...",
  "str_quest_chat_23401013": "Every doll has an owner that adores it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23401014": "Don't worry, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23401015": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_23401016": "Lenore also found PlayerName, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23401017": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_23402001": "PlayerName, Lenore needs some fabric and thread.",
  "str_quest_chat_23402002": "Oh, I have some leftovers from the last Windelion. I hope it's enough.",
  "str_quest_chat_23402003": "Where are you? I'll deliver them to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23402004": "Lenore is waiting at the lounge. Thank you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23402999": "Lenore wants some fabric and thread. Take them to her in the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441001": "Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441002": "Thank you, PlayerName, for letting Lenore stay on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441003": "No problem. You can treat it as your own home.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441004": "Home...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23441005": "The Colossus is PlayerName's home.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441006": "Lenore's home is where May and mother go back to.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441007": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_23441008": "You can come to the Colossus at any time.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441009": "But I feel...",
  "str_quest_chat_23441010": "There are a lot of like-minded friends on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441011": "Over time, maybe these friends will become like family to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_23441012": "So this is what's going on.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441013": "Home is a wondrous place.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441014": "Lenore looks forward to being a family with PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23441015": "Me too... But that sounds a bit weird when said out loud, somehow...",
  "str_quest_chat_23442001": "PlayerName, Lenore feels strange.",
  "str_quest_chat_23442002": "Strange? How?",
  "str_quest_chat_23442003": "There's a feeling Lenore cannot describe inside.",
  "str_quest_chat_23442004": "Are you feeling uncomfortable?",
  "str_quest_chat_23442005": "Nothing's broken inside.",
  "str_quest_chat_23442006": "And it's not the feeling that Lenore cannot move.",
  "str_quest_chat_23442007": "Oh, Lenore remembers! It's the feeling of tightly winded tension springs!",
  "str_quest_chat_23442008": "Everything in the brain is moving, driving the whole body...",
  "str_quest_chat_23442009": "It feels lighter.",
  "str_quest_chat_23442010": "Lenore has not felt like this for a long time.",
  "str_quest_chat_23442011": "Haha! That sounds great.",
  "str_quest_chat_23442012": "Maybe it's because you have better control over your body. It's a good thing!",
  "str_quest_chat_23442013": "Yes... It feels great.",
  "str_quest_chat_23442014": "I'm happy for you, Lenore.",
  "str_quest_chat_23442015": "Thanks, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23443001": "Many changes have happened to Lenore since meeting you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23443002": "I hope I had a positive influence on you",
  "str_quest_chat_23443003": "Don't worry about it. I'm sure it's a good thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_23443004": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_23443005": "Lenore never knew what sleeping felt like.",
  "str_quest_chat_23443006": "Now, Lenore can sleep a whole day.",
  "str_quest_chat_23443007": "Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_23443008": "Lenore never knew what food tasted like.",
  "str_quest_chat_23443009": "Now, Lenore can eat multiple servings.",
  "str_quest_chat_23443010": "Lenore... Are you growing?",
  "str_quest_chat_23443011": "Growing?",
  "str_quest_chat_23443012": "Tell me how did you do it!",
  "str_quest_chat_23443013": "Now that you said it, Lenore seems to be gaining weight.",
  "str_quest_chat_23443014": "Oh... I thought you were getting taller...",
  "str_quest_chat_23443015": "Never mind then.",
  "str_quest_chat_23443016": "Lenore is confused. Gaining weight is not growing...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23444001": "Lenore feels really strong and powerful now.",
  "str_quest_chat_23444002": "Hey, I never knew you were so confident!",
  "str_quest_chat_23444003": "Is confidence... bad?",
  "str_quest_chat_23444004": "No, no! It's great to be confident. It's just that I thought you were more of a humble person.",
  "str_quest_chat_23444005": "That sounds like being humble is better.",
  "str_quest_chat_23444006": "Do you know how to be humble?",
  "str_quest_chat_23444007": "Well... Probably...",
  "str_quest_chat_23444008": "Being able to accept your own mistakes and take in other people's opinions.",
  "str_quest_chat_23444009": "Lenore can't understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_23444010": "From experience... Saying you did a bad job intentionally on something well done...",
  "str_quest_chat_23444011": "Creates the image of being humble...",
  "str_quest_chat_23444012": "Say bad things about good things.",
  "str_quest_chat_23444013": "Lenore understood.",
  "str_quest_chat_23444014": "Do you really...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23444015": "Lenore does not feel strong and powerful.",
  "str_quest_chat_23444016": "Does that sound humble?",
  "str_quest_chat_23444017": "Yes! You got it!",
  "str_quest_chat_23444018": "PlayerName is such a bad person.",
  "str_quest_chat_23444019": "Huh? What did I do?",
  "str_quest_chat_23444020": "Isn't that being humble?",
  "str_quest_chat_23444021": "Lenore... Just be confident.",
  "str_quest_chat_23451001": "Lenore wishes PlayerName a good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_23451002": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_23451003": "Lenore, you don't have to be so formal every time.",
  "str_quest_chat_23451004": "Lenore feels sorry for being too formal.",
  "str_quest_chat_23451005": "How should Lenore do it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23451006": "In the morning, simply \"Morning\" will do.",
  "str_quest_chat_23451007": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_23451008": "Yes! That's it!",
  "str_quest_chat_23451009": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_23451010": "Yeah!",
  "str_quest_chat_23451011": "Morning.",

  "str_quest_chat_23451013": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_23451014": "T-That's not what I meant...",
  "str_quest_chat_23461001": "Are you hungry, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_23461002": "Oh, thanks for reminding me it's already noon!",
  "str_quest_chat_23461003": "Now I'm hungry.",
  "str_quest_chat_23461004": "Does PlayerName's stomach talk too?",
  "str_quest_chat_23461005": "Talk?",
  "str_quest_chat_23461006": "I don't think so...",
  "str_quest_chat_23461007": "So only Lenore's stomach talks?",
  "str_quest_chat_23461008": "Wait. I see what's happening.",
  "str_quest_chat_23461009": "Lenore, you mean your stomach growls?",
  "str_quest_chat_23461010": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_23461011": "Growl. Yes. It growls every time when Lenore is hungry.",
  "str_quest_chat_23461012": "Hahaha! That's not your stomach talking!",
  "str_quest_chat_23461013": "Wait... Don't tell me you've been trying to talk to your stomach so you haven't eaten?",
  "str_quest_chat_23461014": "If Lenore eats, the stomach no longer talks.",
  "str_quest_chat_23461015": "You better get something to eat first...",
  "str_quest_chat_23462001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23462002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_23462003": "Are you busy, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_23462004": "Is there anything Lenore can do to help?",
  "str_quest_chat_23462005": "Well... I'm working.",
  "str_quest_chat_23462006": "But I don't need Lenore's help at the moment.",
  "str_quest_chat_23462007": "Why does everyone has things they need to do...",
  "str_quest_chat_23462008": "You don't have anything you need to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_23462009": "Lenore has already finished cleaning work for the malfunctioning fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat_23462010": "Lenore has double-checked the recent bills for Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_23462011": "And also prayed to Truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_23462012": "What should Lenore do next?",
  "str_quest_chat_23462013": "You've done so many things already?",
  "str_quest_chat_23462014": "I think I need to be more efficient...",
  "str_quest_chat_23481001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_23481002": "Good evening, Lenore.",
  "str_quest_chat_23481003": "Why aren't PlayerName sleeping yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_23481004": "Are you here to get me to sleep, Lenore?",
  "str_quest_chat_23481005": "Yes. A good kid should sleep at this hour.",

  "str_quest_chat_23481011": "So go to sleep, Lenore.",
  "str_quest_chat_23481012": "Hmm. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_23481013": "I can't believe that actually... worked!",
  "str_quest_chat_23481014": "Now I can stay up late!",
  "str_quest_chat_23481015": "You go to sleep too, PlayerName. Good night.",

  "str_quest_chat_23482008": "Huh? I didn't. Who told you that?",
  "str_quest_chat_23482009": "Wait... I did shed a few tears last night...",
  "str_quest_chat_23482010": "But it was because my eyes were uncomfortable.",
  "str_quest_chat_23482011": "Perhaps.",
  "str_quest_chat_23482012": "Tears come out sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat_23482013": "The snotty kids in Umbraton had the nerve to ask me how I usually bathe!",
  "str_quest_chat_23482014": "Next time, please tell Lenore when you cry, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23482015": "Lenore... I really appreciate that.",
  "str_quest_chat_23482016": "Water coming out of the eyes is such a curious thing. Lenore likes it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23482017": "Is that the reason!?",
  "str_quest_chat_23483001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_23483002": "G-Good evening...? What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_23483003": "The night is so special.",

  "str_quest_chat_23483009": "Lenore, we have to treat our body well!",
  "str_quest_chat_23483010": "Try taking a deep breath.",
  "str_quest_chat_23483011": "A deep breath?",
  "str_quest_chat_23483012": "Yeah. Slowly inhale, and then slowly exhale.",
  "str_quest_chat_23483013": "Let all the troubles out with your breath!",
  "str_quest_chat_23483014": "Lenore will try.",
  "str_quest_chat_23483015": "Thank you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23484001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_23484002": "Lenore heard people talking about PlayerName today.",
  "str_quest_chat_23484003": "People talking about me? I hope it's nothing but good things...",
  "str_quest_chat_23484004": "They were laughing, so must be good things.",
  "str_quest_chat_23484005": "Sounds suspicious...",
  "str_quest_chat_23484006": "But there's something Lenore doesn't understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_23484007": "Is PlayerName's face sweet?",
  "str_quest_chat_23484008": "Sweet? Why do you think that?",
  "str_quest_chat_23484009": "They said, PlayerName's face turns to a red apple when shy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23484010": "That's only a metaphor. Don't take it literally.",
  "str_quest_chat_23484011": "So a metaphor is a lie?",
  "str_quest_chat_23484012": "Not a lie... It's a kind of description, saying two things are similar to each other.",
  "str_quest_chat_23484013": "PlayerName is sweet like a red apple.",
  "str_quest_chat_23484014": "Yeah, that's it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23484015": "But wait... Who's saying that!?",
  "str_quest_chat_23485001": "So this is how it feels to have a late-night snack.",
  "str_quest_chat_23485002": "Oh, are you having a late-night snack, Lenore?",
  "str_quest_chat_23485003": "Someone told Lenore to try and eat at this time of day.",
  "str_quest_chat_23485004": "How do you feel?",
  "str_quest_chat_23485005": "F-full.",
  "str_quest_chat_23485006": "Well, indulging in the occasional late night snack is okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_23485007": "Don't do it often, though. That's unhealthy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23485008": "Keep that in mind, Lenore.",
  "str_quest_chat_23501001": "Help me, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_23501002": "Giles? What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_23501003": "They're fighting and arguing in my head!",
  "str_quest_chat_23501004": "They can't fight it out, so they're eating away my sanity...",
  "str_quest_chat_23501005": "Help me, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_23501006": "Ugh... I'll take you to a doctor!",
  "str_quest_chat_23501007": "No doctor can help me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23501008": "Someone's waving at me from within the mist.",
  "str_quest_chat_23501009": "That someone is none other than you, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_23501010": "Only you can save me!",
  "str_quest_chat_23501011": "I don't get what you mean, Giles... What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_23501012": "I've hit the greatest bottleneck in my career!",
  "str_quest_chat_23501013": "I wish to write a nursery rhyme for you, but I can't bring myself to do it!",
  "str_quest_chat_23501014": "What about... just don't write it for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23501015": "I appreciate what you're trying to do for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23501016": "Is that so? Is that so? Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_23501017": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_23501018": "I'll go sleep now then.",
  "str_quest_chat_23501019": "That's it!?",
  "str_quest_chat_23541001": "You sure got a nice place here, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23541002": "Thanks! It sure is.",
  "str_quest_chat_23541003": "The bed is a bit hard, but not to the point of being uncomfortable.",
  "str_quest_chat_23541004": "Oh, and the chairs on the aisles are good for resting.",
  "str_quest_chat_23541005": "By the way, I heard there's a stage somewhere on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_23541006": "Maybe I can sing my rhymes there.",
  "str_quest_chat_23541007": "That stage sure is popular...",
  "str_quest_chat_23541008": "Looks like we have a lot of good singers here.",
  "str_quest_chat_23541009": "If you count yelling and shouting \"singing\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_23541010": "It's fine!",
  "str_quest_chat_23541011": "There are a few with nice voices.",
  "str_quest_chat_23541012": "Interesting. However...",
  "str_quest_chat_23541013": "As long as the meaning of the rhyme is expressed, issues with the tune itself can be overlooked.",
  "str_quest_chat_23541014": "Hahahaha! That's great!",
  "str_quest_chat_23541015": "I'm going to sing my rhymes there every day!",
  "str_quest_chat_23541016": "No. I'm gonna go do it now!",
  "str_quest_chat_23541017": "Later, my lovely PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23542001": "PlayerName, let me ask you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23542002": "As my loyal fan, how much do you enjoy my rhymes?",
  "str_quest_chat_23542003": "Ugh... Am I supposed to do some boot-licking?",
  "str_quest_chat_23542004": "Hurry up! What's your answer?",
  "str_quest_chat_23542005": "If I could, I would've given it an 11 out of 10!",
  "str_quest_chat_23542006": "And listen to it for millennia!",
  "str_quest_chat_23542007": "Oh? Hahahahaha!",
  "str_quest_chat_23542008": "If you enjoy them that much, then you better pay attention!",
  "str_quest_chat_23542009": "I find I have had endless inspirations lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_23542010": "Soon, I'll be able to show you even more great rhymes!",
  "str_quest_chat_23542011": "Sounds... like a good thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_23542012": "Of course! And I promise...",
  "str_quest_chat_23542013": "You'll be immersed in the world of rhymes! Like forever!",
  "str_quest_chat_23542014": "Forever... is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23543001": "PlayerName, do you know how long have I been sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_23543002": "Why are you asking me...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23543003": "Because I believe you would know.",
  "str_quest_chat_23543004": "Ugh... Can you stop saying things that would give people the wrong idea about us?",
  "str_quest_chat_23543005": "So how long have I been sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_23543006": "Well, I saw you going back to your room...",
  "str_quest_chat_23543007": "That was about an hour ago. So, if you've been sleeping for all that time, it'd be an hour.",
  "str_quest_chat_23543008": "Hm. Interesting. So it was shorter than my usual nap.",
  "str_quest_chat_23543009": "But why do I get the feeling that...",
  "str_quest_chat_23543010": "I've been sleeping for a long time...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23543011": "I have tens of thousands of years of energy building up inside me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23543012": "Wh... Why, why, why?",
  "str_quest_chat_23543013": "Well, it seems like you're quite well-rested despite the short sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_23543014": "And you're refreshed. That's a good thing, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23543015": "I know! PlayerName, you must've done something to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23543016": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_23543017": "You must be the reason for my sudden increase in power!",
  "str_quest_chat_23543018": "I see! I see now.",
  "str_quest_chat_23543019": "That's the answer. This is great!",
  "str_quest_chat_23543020": "I can finally go and have a good sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_23543021": "Going back to sleep... again?",
  "str_quest_chat_23544001": "Something wondrous has happened.",
  "str_quest_chat_23544002": "Something both surprising and nostalgic.",
  "str_quest_chat_23544003": "Surprising?",
  "str_quest_chat_23544004": "Yes, surprising, like a newborn crying at the brave new world it was born into...",
  "str_quest_chat_23544005": "Nostalgic?",
  "str_quest_chat_23544006": "Yes, nostalgic, like the past that is done and gone.",
  "str_quest_chat_23544007": "Back then...",
  "str_quest_chat_23544008": "When Isaac poured the boiling blood into my throat...",
  "str_quest_chat_23544009": "I was just as surprised as I am now.",
  "str_quest_chat_23544010": "The scorching sweet liquid made me tremble. And then... and then!",
  "str_quest_chat_23544011": "The rhyme of Truth that laid dormant inside of me... was awakened!",
  "str_quest_chat_23544012": "The horns burst out of the skull...",
  "str_quest_chat_23544013": "At that moment, I understood everything, yet had forgotten everything...",
  "str_quest_chat_23544014": "That fantastical?",
  "str_quest_chat_23544015": "Fantastical... fantastical? It is indeed, I tell you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23544016": "And now, I'm having that experience all over again!",
  "str_quest_chat_23544017": "You are the medium!",
  "str_quest_chat_23544018": "W-What are you going to do to me? You're not gonna drink my...",
  "str_quest_chat_23544019": "I want to...",
  "str_quest_chat_23544020": "I really want to thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_23544021": "Oh... No problem.",
  "str_quest_chat_23561001": "Tasty food is ready!",
  "str_quest_chat_23561002": "Giles, you look energetic today.",
  "str_quest_chat_23561003": "Of course. It's time to eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_23561004": "So what's for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_23561005": "Roasted chicken, roasted goose, or steak?",
  "str_quest_chat_23561006": "I'm afraid you'll be disappointed...",
  "str_quest_chat_23561007": "Sandworm meat, you say?",
  "str_quest_chat_23561008": "It's okay. I don't mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_23561009": "It's vegan salad.",
  "str_quest_chat_23561010": "Oh. I better get back to bed, then. Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_23581001": "I can finally get some sleep...",
  "str_quest_chat_23581002": "Looks like you've been busy today, Giles.",
  "str_quest_chat_23581003": "Fine, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_23581004": "I rested a bit after breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_23581005": "I rested a bit after lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_23581006": "And it's this hour already after I finished dinner.",
  "str_quest_chat_23581007": "A day is so short!",
  "str_quest_chat_23581008": "Don't you get a headache from sleeping for so long?",
  "str_quest_chat_23582001": "*Yawn*",
  "str_quest_chat_23582002": "Still busy?",
  "str_quest_chat_23582003": "Ugh, yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat_23582004": "You need to rest, my lovely PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23582005": "I'm ready to take a break.",
  "str_quest_chat_23582006": "Good, my lovely PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23582007": "What's more important than singing rhymes?",
  "str_quest_chat_23582008": "Many things are.",
  "str_quest_chat_23582009": "Such as maintaining the Colossus, procuring supplies...",
  "str_quest_chat_23582010": "And funds management!",
  "str_quest_chat_23582011": "Boring... boring... BORING! That's no life!",
  "str_quest_chat_23582012": "There might be some truth to that...",
  "str_quest_chat_23582013": "All you need is to listen to my rhymes more often.",
  "str_quest_chat_23582014": "Really...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23583001": "It's getting dark. This color reminds me of...",
  "str_quest_chat_23583002": "Isaac.",
  "str_quest_chat_23583003": "I didn't think you'd still remember my lamb.",
  "str_quest_chat_23583004": "But it actually reminds me of... the raven.",
  "str_quest_chat_23583005": "The raven.",
  "str_quest_chat_23583006": "The raven is black.",
  "str_quest_chat_23583007": "The raven...",
  "str_quest_chat_23583008": "Why is a raven like a writing desk?",
  "str_quest_chat_23583009": "A raven is like a writing desk... Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_23583010": "Looks like even PlayerName doesn't know the answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_23583011": "The answer has long eluded me...",
  "str_quest_chat_23583012": "I wanted to forget about it, but the night just had to remind me of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23583013": "I won't be getting any sleep tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_23583014": "Could it be that there is no answer to it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23583015": "Well, you've given me something new to think about.",
  "str_quest_chat_23584001": "*Yawn*",
  "str_quest_chat_23584002": "Don't tell me you're still busy doing weird things.",
  "str_quest_chat_23584003": "I've already gotten ready for bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_23584004": "Ohhhhh? That doesn't sound like you at all, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_23584005": "Could it be that since you lost to me in terms of height...",
  "str_quest_chat_23584006": "You care far more about getting adequate rest now?",
  "str_quest_chat_23584007": "I didn't lose to you. You cheated with the horns.",
  "str_quest_chat_23584008": "Unfortunate for you, the horns are a part of me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23584009": "I'm going to turn in early. That's how I'm gonna get taller.",
  "str_quest_chat_23584010": "Let me tell you something...",
  "str_quest_chat_23584011": "My horns will keep on growing!",
  "str_quest_chat_23584012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_23585001": "I'm not a freak!",
  "str_quest_chat_23585002": "Giles? Are you alright?",
  "str_quest_chat_23585003": "Don't call me a freak again!",
  "str_quest_chat_23585004": "I've never called you a freak...",
  "str_quest_chat_23585005": "But just now, before those people from Lumopolis...",
  "str_quest_chat_23585006": "You pointed at me and called me a freak!",
  "str_quest_chat_23585007": "Giles... Were you dreaming?",
  "str_quest_chat_23585008": "Take a look around. We're not in Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_23585009": "It's not... Lumopolis...",
  "str_quest_chat_23585010": "Oh, it's that same nightmare again.",
  "str_quest_chat_23585011": "It's okay. Dreams are the opposite of reality.",
  "str_quest_chat_23585012": "If you think in opposite... The truth is...",
  "str_quest_chat_23585013": "I praised you... for great rhymes!",
  "str_quest_chat_23585014": "Hahah! Of course my rhymes are great. You've got good taste!",
  "str_quest_chat_23585015": "Unlike those from Lumopolis...",
  "str_quest_chat_23585016": "Never mind that. I'm gonna sleep. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_23585017": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_23586001": "Are you about to go to bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_23586002": "Are you off to bed, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_23586003": "Wait, don't answer yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_23586004": "If your answer is \"I'm off to bed,\" that'll impact Giles' answer, won't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23586005": "Ah... So Giles' decision relies on your response, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_23586006": "In that case, he should answer first.",
  "str_quest_chat_23586007": "I'm off to bed, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_23586008": "Good night, sleep tight.",
  "str_quest_chat_23586009": "... Good night, Giles.",
  "str_quest_chat_23601001": "PlayerName, I've got something to tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23601002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23601003": "You've seen Mr. Beau before, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23601004": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_23601005": "It's that big fluffy white cat by your side, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23601006": "Your precious?",
  "str_quest_chat_23601007": "White kitty, my little precious Beau!",
  "str_quest_chat_23601008": "What happened to your precious?",
  "str_quest_chat_23601009": "My Beau really likes PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23601010": "I'm such an attractive being for animals...",
  "str_quest_chat_23601011": "Anyway, thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_23601012": "Mr. Beau wants to see you everyday.",
  "str_quest_chat_23601013": "Sure, any time!",
  "str_quest_chat_23601014": "So... in order to fulfill his wish...",
  "str_quest_chat_23601015": "I suppose I must bring him to come to see you every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_23601016": "You're coming to see me too?",
  "str_quest_chat_23601017": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_23602001": "PlayerName, are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_23602002": "I have a question for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23602003": "Go ahead.",
  "str_quest_chat_23602004": "It's better to ask you face to face. Come to the cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_23602999": "May is waiting at the cafe to ask you a question. Do kids have troubles of their own, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_23641001": "Ah-ha-ha.",
  "str_quest_chat_23641002": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_23641003": "May, anything good?",
  "str_quest_chat_23641004": "I'm getting better and better at sewing things.",
  "str_quest_chat_23641005": "That's good, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23641006": "Good to hear that!",
  "str_quest_chat_23641007": "Do you really mean that, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_23641008": "Of course. As your friend, I'm happy for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23641009": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_23641010": "Is there anything I can sew for you, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_23641011": "Hmmm.... I can't think of anything right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_23641012": "Like tattered clothes or bed sheets?",
  "str_quest_chat_23641013": "Well... None of my clothing needs to be patched up lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_23641014": "How about a new backpack or cushion?",
  "str_quest_chat_23641015": "Well... I have lots of those already.",
  "str_quest_chat_23641016": "A wound... or someone's mouth?",
  "str_quest_chat_23641017": "This is getting frightening and dangerous!",
  "str_quest_chat_23642001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_23642002": "Have you noticed any changes in me lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_23642003": "Come to think of it... I think you've grown much lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_23642004": "... Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_23642005": "I mean it!",
  "str_quest_chat_23642006": "Do you think people from the True Order would notice that too?",
  "str_quest_chat_23642007": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_23642008": "Would people on the Colossus notice that?",
  "str_quest_chat_23642009": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_23642010": "Would... Lenore notice that?",
  "str_quest_chat_23642011": "I think Lenore would be the first one to notice.",
  "str_quest_chat_23642012": "I... I don't need her attention.",
  "str_quest_chat_23642013": "So why do you want her to notice your changes?",
  "str_quest_chat_23642014": "I want to put her in her place and stay out of my way.",
  "str_quest_chat_23642015": "Understood. I'll give her the message in full.",
  "str_quest_chat_23642016": "Ugh... Please don't!",
  "str_quest_chat_23661001": "Half of a day is a half day.",
  "str_quest_chat_23661002": "Good afternoon, May.",
  "str_quest_chat_23661003": "There's nothing good about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23661004": "Why? What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_23661005": "If I don't talk to you, would you ignore me too?",
  "str_quest_chat_23661006": "Please don't misunderstand...",
  "str_quest_chat_23661007": "I just don't want to disturb you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23661008": "I...",
  "str_quest_chat_23661009": "I'm just afraid that you're busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23661010": "So... It's not that you don't like me?",
  "str_quest_chat_23661011": "Of course not, May!",
  "str_quest_chat_23661012": "I believe you... for now. I'm gonna get back to my things now.",
  "str_quest_chat_23661013": "Walked away just like that...",
  "str_quest_chat_23662001": "Still asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_23662002": "How did you know I was having a lunch break?",
  "str_quest_chat_23662003": "Because I sneaked into your room just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_23662004": "What? What did you do to me?",
  "str_quest_chat_23662005": "Your hair was a mess, and it annoyed me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23662006": "So I combed your hair when you were sleeping. No need to thank me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23662007": "But my hair... Why is it all sticky and stuff?",
  "str_quest_chat_23662008": "I saw hair gel in your room, so I used it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23662009": "That's honey I went to great lengths to get from Northland!",
  "str_quest_chat_23663001": "It's already noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_23663002": "I really envy Mr. Beau. He's sleeping again.",
  "str_quest_chat_23663003": "Why don't you take a break too, May?",
  "str_quest_chat_23663004": "Is it alright... to take a break?",
  "str_quest_chat_23663005": "Of course. You can do whatever you want on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_23663006": "Err... Except fight.",
  "str_quest_chat_23663007": "A break... Hmm.",
  "str_quest_chat_23663008": "Alright, good day to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23663009": "Good day to you too, May.",
  "str_quest_chat_23681001": "Oh, it's getting dark.",
  "str_quest_chat_23681002": "Do you know why it gets dark?",
  "str_quest_chat_23681003": "It's complicated.",
  "str_quest_chat_23681004": "Let me think about how to explain.",
  "str_quest_chat_23681005": "How is it complicated? Let me tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23681006": "It's because the Truth thinks we need to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_23681007": "So it covers the sky up with a huge piece of black cloth.",
  "str_quest_chat_23681008": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_23681009": "Didn't know that, did you? It's a top-secret.",
  "str_quest_chat_23681010": "I didn't see that coming... at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682002": "G-Good evening...? What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_23682003": "Am I only allowed to talk to you if I need something, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_23682004": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682005": "Well, my job keeps me busy most of the time...",
  "str_quest_chat_23682006": "All the grown-ups use the same excuse.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682007": "May is busy too. Ahaha.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682008": "What are you busy doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_23682009": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682010": "Feel free to talk when you want to, really.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682011": "It's just that I may get back to you a bit later, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682012": "Grown-ups all seem to be always busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682013": "I need to keep myself busy too.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682014": "What are you going to get busy with?",
  "str_quest_chat_23682015": "... No reply?",
  "str_quest_chat_23682016": "I'm busy. Leave a message.",
  "str_quest_chat_23682017": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_23683001": "Ah-ha-ha.",
  "str_quest_chat_23683002": "It's late. What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_23683003": "What do you think you're doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_23683004": "I'm getting ready to sleep. What?",
  "str_quest_chat_23683005": "How about I tell you a bedtime story...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23683006": "A long time ago, there was this person who lived inside the belly of a big bird.",
  "str_quest_chat_23683007": "Oh? So it's me and the Soroz. What happens next?",
  "str_quest_chat_23683008": "What happens next...? I don't know.",
  "str_quest_chat_23683009": "May, tell me the truth. You want to hear bedtime stories, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_23683010": "I didn't say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_23683011": "Alright. I'll send fireflies that can tell bedtime stories to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23683012": "Really? How soon can they get here?",
  "str_quest_chat_23683013": "Oh, uh, nothing. You should go to bed. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_23683014": "What a dishonest kid...",
  "str_quest_chat_23701001": "I used to think delivering speeches was stupid.",
  "str_quest_chat_23701002": "But your speech was so motivating...",
  "str_quest_chat_23701003": "Haha, those are things I'm only capable of saying now.",
  "str_quest_chat_23701004": "What's different between then and now?",
  "str_quest_chat_23701005": "I've learned to respect the emotions of others and take advantage of them.",
  "str_quest_chat_23701006": "I used to think speeches were so unnecesssarily riotous.",
  "str_quest_chat_23701007": "Later on, however, I realized that they also give people hope.",
  "str_quest_chat_23701008": "It isn't helpful to scorn the way superiors manage things.",
  "str_quest_chat_23701009": "Perhaps true growth occurs when people try to understand how the people they don't like think.",
  "str_quest_chat_23701010": "Hmm... when you put it like that...",
  "str_quest_chat_23701011": "I don't mean to give you a lecture. I'm only telling you this because...",
  "str_quest_chat_23701012": "Probably because you always give me the impression of being a \"friendly secretary.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_23701013": "... Somehow, I feel like that's not a compliment.",
  "str_quest_chat_23702001": "Do you ever feel stiff in your cheeks?",
  "str_quest_chat_23702002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_23702003": "Whenever I sleep only on one side, I wake up feeling like that in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_23702004": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_23702005": "I'm not too sure what that would feel like...",
  "str_quest_chat_23702006": "After I came back from seeing the new recruits today, I found that my face was stiff was smiling so much.",
  "str_quest_chat_23702007": "I guess... that's also a form of responsibility, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23702008": "Of course, and the most immaterial one at that.",
  "str_quest_chat_23702009": "But I don't feel relieved at the sight of their unbounded confidence.",
  "str_quest_chat_23702010": "Hmm... I get what you mean.",
  "str_quest_chat_23702011": "It's not hard to ignite one's confidence, but what's difficult is sustaining it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23702012": "Let's hope we can ensure all those who trust us retain this sort of attitude, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23703001": "You were asking Vivian about me and Wrath today, weren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_23703002": "I-I...",
  "str_quest_chat_23703003": "Relax. Countless people in Illumina share the same curiosity as you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23703004": "I-I'll just get straight to the point then!",
  "str_quest_chat_23703005": "Yes, I'm very curious indeed!",
  "str_quest_chat_23703006": "We're both classmates and great friends; not only do we have a superior-subordinate relationship, but we're also rivals.",
  "str_quest_chat_23703007": "That's why, she's very important to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23703008": "I knew it!",
  "str_quest_chat_23703009": "She's as important to me as everyone else in Illumina.",
  "str_quest_chat_23703010": "... That reads like a public relations statement.",
  "str_quest_chat_23703011": "Have I let you down or something?",
  "str_quest_chat_23703012": "Ahem, no, not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_23704001": "As I recall, you're very good at taking notes, right PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_23704002": "I wouldn't say I'm amazing, but I do keep track of what I see and hear during my journey.",
  "str_quest_chat_23704003": "Is that so? Excellent.",
  "str_quest_chat_23704004": "Vivian took a leave of absence, so I need someone to take her place and take notes for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23704005": "Are you interested?",
  "str_quest_chat_23704006": "Does this mean... I get to see the Grand Marshal of the Illumina Federation at work in person?",
  "str_quest_chat_23704007": "Hahaha, that's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_23704008": "Of course I'm interested!",
  "str_quest_chat_23704009": "But am I really going to be able to shoulder such hefty responsibility?",
  "str_quest_chat_23704010": "I asked you, which means I have faith in you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23704011": "Do you doubt my judgement?",
  "str_quest_chat_23704012": "... No!",
  "str_quest_chat_23704013": "Good.",
  "str_quest_chat_23704014": "I'm on the bridge right now, come and join me when you're ready.",
  "str_quest_chat_23704015": "... Now?",
  "str_quest_chat_23704016": "It's okay, if you don't have the time, I'll find someone else.",
  "str_quest_chat_23704017": "I do, I do! I'll head over right away!",
  "str_quest_chat_23704999": "The Grand Marshal has personally asked for your help! We can't afford to be sloppy. Go to the Bridge now and meet her there!",
  "str_quest_chat_23741001": "I finally get to meet you here.",
  "str_quest_chat_23741002": "Greetings, Grand Marshal...",
  "str_quest_chat_23741003": "So serious? I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_23741004": "Hello, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23741005": "I'm Reinhardt. I'm glad to meet you once again on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_23741006": "I mean, we don't have to be that formal...",
  "str_quest_chat_23741007": "I just thought that as a junior, I should speak to you more formally.",
  "str_quest_chat_23741008": "I'm very down-to-earth.",
  "str_quest_chat_23741009": "Not according to Vice...",
  "str_quest_chat_23741010": "Really? What did she tell you?",
  "str_quest_chat_23741011": "She said you always look so majestic and competent!",
  "str_quest_chat_23741012": "Well, these comments don't imply that I'm not approachable.",
  "str_quest_chat_23741013": "You'll see. We have all the time in the world.",
  "str_quest_chat_23741014": "... Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742001": "I see you're full of energy now.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742002": "Life on the Colossus is very comfortable, a kind of simple joy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742003": "But one shouldn't become complacent.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742004": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_23742005": "I mean, it's not always so quiet on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_23742006": "We do have a lot to worry about everyday.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742007": "Oh, I'm just talking about myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742008": "I didn't mean to enforce the same idea on anyone else.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742009": "Ah, apologies.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742010": "You are very empathetic, which is a good thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742011": "Well... because we all have our own troubles.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742012": "So I hope when we're on the Colossus, everyone can strive to be happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742013": "Yes, and that's great.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742014": "Happiness is an emotion that propels us forward.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742015": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_23742016": "Perhaps the stamina that times of leisure give us is a good thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_23742017": "That's what I'll tell myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_23743001": "I made a big decision today.",
  "str_quest_chat_23743002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23743003": "I pardoned a group of spies.",
  "str_quest_chat_23743004": "... Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_23743005": "Would you like to know the reason?",
  "str_quest_chat_23743006": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_23743007": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_23743008": "No...",
  "str_quest_chat_23743009": "Sometimes ignorance is bliss...",
  "str_quest_chat_23743010": "The reason was simple—there was no classified information involved.",
  "str_quest_chat_23743011": "It's just because I feel like I've become stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_23743012": "The Illumina Federation and I are both improving.",
  "str_quest_chat_23743013": "In that case, it no longer makes sense to keep enemy spies locked up for so long.",
  "str_quest_chat_23743014": "As long as people trust and love Illumina, we have no fear of these spies.",
  "str_quest_chat_23743015": "Yes... That makes perfect sense.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744001": "Are there rats here?",
  "str_quest_chat_23744002": "I don't think so?! Don't freak me out...",
  "str_quest_chat_23744003": "The Colossus is very sanitary!",
  "str_quest_chat_23744004": "Your tone suggests you must hate rodents as much as the majority of people.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744005": "Hamsters... are pretty cute.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744006": "But mice... well...",
  "str_quest_chat_23744007": "I actually think mice are admirable creatures.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744008": "They're filthy, but amazing.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744009": "Mice have an unparalleled desire to survive and a strong ability to adapt.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744010": "They can survive almost anywhere.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744011": "Well... That's true, but also very unhygienic, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23744012": "Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744013": "Although unhygienic, they survive, and live quite robustly.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744014": "You know what? People always want to climb higher and farther up the ladder.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744015": "Little do they know that sometimes the only task society gives them is to survive.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744016": "Do you mean that... many Aurorians are like mice, struggling to survive?",
  "str_quest_chat_23744017": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744018": "Therefore, it is kind of arrogant for us to accuse the struggling mice of being unhygienic.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744019": "Hmm... If you put it that way, you're right...",
  "str_quest_chat_23744020": "What made you suddenly start thinking this way?",
  "str_quest_chat_23744021": "Maybe because I'm improving.",
  "str_quest_chat_23744022": "It's not just an improvement of combat skills or general abilities, but of mindset.",
  "str_quest_chat_23751001": "I slept well last night and woke up feeling full of energy today.",
  "str_quest_chat_23751002": "*Yawn* Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_23751003": "You had a bad night.",
  "str_quest_chat_23751004": "Guilty as charged.",
  "str_quest_chat_23751005": "It's still early. I suggest you lay back down and get some more sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_23751006": "Trust me, it's a lot better than just bracing yourself and going straight to work.",
  "str_quest_chat_23751007": "Good point.",
  "str_quest_chat_23751008": "Off you go then.",
  "str_quest_chat_23751009": "I wish you a brand new start to the day in a little while.",
  "str_quest_chat_23751010": "Same to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23752001": "Good morning, I would like to deal with the following matters today.",
  "str_quest_chat_23752002": "The first is the airflow problem in the Undercity, which can cause small explosions if not handled properly.",
  "str_quest_chat_23752003": "Next is planning out the design for latest Undercities.",
  "str_quest_chat_23752004": "Wrath and the others are always arguing about that.",
  "str_quest_chat_23752005": "Finally, I've got to listen to Vivian's report.",
  "str_quest_chat_23752006": "She came up with a new plan to reform travel and management practices.",
  "str_quest_chat_23752007": "Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_23752008": "They all sound complicated...",
  "str_quest_chat_23752009": "If you have time, you can think about them and see if you can come up with any solutions.",
  "str_quest_chat_23752010": "Is this... some sort of training method of yours?",
  "str_quest_chat_23752011": "Interpret it any way you want.",
  "str_quest_chat_23752012": "I've got to get going. See ya.",
  "str_quest_chat_23752013": "See you!",
  "str_quest_chat_23753001": "I'm so sleepy!",
  "str_quest_chat_23753002": "You get sleepy too?!",
  "str_quest_chat_23753003": "Ahem, sorry, I shouldn't have lost my composure.",
  "str_quest_chat_23753004": "Of course, it's not like I'm built any differently from the rest of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23753005": "I was up all night yesterday checking the income status of a random sample of officers.",
  "str_quest_chat_23753006": "It didn't look good, and I had to deal with them last minute.",
  "str_quest_chat_23753007": "Income... status?",
  "str_quest_chat_23753008": "There was some major corruption going on.",
  "str_quest_chat_23753009": "S-Should you be telling me this?",
  "str_quest_chat_23753010": "Why not? There's no need to cover up things like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_23761001": "Good afternoon, taking a break?",
  "str_quest_chat_23761002": "Just about to.",
  "str_quest_chat_23761003": "That was my original plan too.",
  "str_quest_chat_23761004": "... \"Original plan\"? What about now?",
  "str_quest_chat_23761005": "I'm in the barracks. The Illuminan solders are resting too.",
  "str_quest_chat_23761006": "... It's like being in the middle of a storm with all this snoring!",
  "str_quest_chat_23761007": "But it comforts me to know that they're getting a good rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_23761008": "Take a break, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23761009": "Good afternoon, Grand Marshal.",
  "str_quest_chat_23762001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23762002": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_23762003": "What do you normally have for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_23762004": "A simple lunch box...",
  "str_quest_chat_23762005": "Whatever that's available.",
  "str_quest_chat_23762006": "It depends on what Vice prepared...",
  "str_quest_chat_23762007": "Her cooking has gotten better lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_23762008": "And I'm not picky anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_23762009": "Hmm, that's good.",
  "str_quest_chat_23762010": "Why did you ask?",
  "str_quest_chat_23762011": "No reason, really. I just saw the food served on the Colossus and decided to compare it with Illumina's rationed lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_23762012": "Any differences?",
  "str_quest_chat_23762013": "You have more choices here, but Illumina's meal rations are more nutritionally balanced.",
  "str_quest_chat_23762014": "As for the taste, our food may not be as personalized.",
  "str_quest_chat_23762015": "But the soldiers will grow strong!",
  "str_quest_chat_23762016": "I believe I had it once...",
  "str_quest_chat_23762017": "Really? What'd you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_23762018": "The portions are huge... but it's not bad.",
  "str_quest_chat_23762019": "Well, that's good to know.",
  "str_quest_chat_23763001": "Nothing beats the post-battle risotto!",
  "str_quest_chat_23763002": "I have to say, you have unique taste.",
  "str_quest_chat_23763003": "Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_23763004": "But how many soldiers can cook as well as Gram?",
  "str_quest_chat_23763005": "So, though some delicious food might be simple to prepare, they're not always available.",
  "str_quest_chat_23763006": "On the other hand, risotto is great! It's easy and convenient to make, cost-efficient, and no one can possibly fail to make it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23763007": "Ah, that's true.",
  "str_quest_chat_23763008": "I've already had thirty barrels sent to you. They should be at your door soon.",
  "str_quest_chat_23763009": "Th-Thirty barrels?",
  "str_quest_chat_23763010": "There are so many people on the Colossus. Take your time. You'll finish it sooner or later.",
  "str_quest_chat_23763011": "T-Thanks...",
  "str_quest_chat_23781001": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_23781002": "Good night, Reinhardt.",
  "str_quest_chat_23781003": "Yes, I'm going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_23781004": "So early?",
  "str_quest_chat_23781005": "Of course, no decision should be put off, whether it's rest or work.",
  "str_quest_chat_23781006": "Especially when you have a lot on your mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_23781007": "What are you stressing over?",
  "str_quest_chat_23781008": "I have a lot to keep in balance, so that's all the more reason for me to rest early.",
  "str_quest_chat_23781009": "Because I don't like making big decisions right before bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_23781010": "Hmm... It feels like someone else has told me that before...",
  "str_quest_chat_23781011": "Really? Looks like great minds think alike.",
  "str_quest_chat_23781012": "Anyway, don't stay up too late. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782001": "It's best to ponder fragmented plans at night in bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782002": "Fragmented plans?",
  "str_quest_chat_23782003": "Incomplete, scattered plans.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782004": "Things like what to eat tomorrow, what kind of coffee to drink, which weapon to use, what training to do, and so on.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782005": "This way, you can execute those decisions as soon as you wake up. No extra time needs to be wasted thinking about them.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782006": "Hmm... That makes sense.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782007": "Where are you going to sleep tonight?",
  "str_quest_chat_23782008": "That's one of my fragmented plans.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782009": "What to eat tomorrow, what kind of coffee to drink, which weapon to use, what training to do...",
  "str_quest_chat_23782010": "And where to sleep tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782011": "To sleep on the training grounds, or go back to my office?",
  "str_quest_chat_23782012": "Sleeping on the Colossus is a good idea too.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782013": "Th-They all sound fine...",
  "str_quest_chat_23782014": "You can try thinking like this too.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782015": "It's just a suggestion, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_23782016": "Got it!",
  "str_quest_chat_23782017": "Go on and get some rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_23783001": "Good evening.",

  "str_quest_chat_23783008": "I always feel that staying up late drains my energy...",
  "str_quest_chat_23783009": "Although everyone knows that staying up late is bad for their health, being able to stay up late is a kind of privilege.",
  "str_quest_chat_23783010": "... Privilege?",
  "str_quest_chat_23783011": "To bear the consequences of staying up late, you either have to rely on a young body or strong willpower.",
  "str_quest_chat_23783012": "Compared to willpower, youth is obviously more valuable.",
  "str_quest_chat_23783013": "Hmm... that makes sense.",

  "str_quest_chat_23801002": "That's a difficult question to answer...",
  "str_quest_chat_23801003": "Ah, I didn't mean to put you in a difficult position!",
  "str_quest_chat_23801004": "It's just that when I look in the mirror every now and then, I feel a little surprised...",
  "str_quest_chat_23801005": "Sometimes I notice my hair has become a bit lighter, or my body has grown stronger, and so on.",
  "str_quest_chat_23801006": "So I just wanted to ask if you find it strange to see me like this?",
  "str_quest_chat_23801007": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_23801008": "A little bit, but I think you're still the same person.",
  "str_quest_chat_23801009": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_23801010": "You give off the same vibe as before!",
  "str_quest_chat_23801011": "Ah... That's good.",
  "str_quest_chat_23801012": "As long as you don't think I'm different, it's all good!",
  "str_quest_chat_23801013": "Well... I'll try to get used to this body too.",
  "str_quest_chat_23802001": "An interesting thing happened yesterday, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_23802002": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_23802003": "My hair used to be very unruly, so I always pinned it down with two hairpins.",
  "str_quest_chat_23802004": "Now... well, now, only one side is unruly while the other has become silky smooth.",
  "str_quest_chat_23802005": "Oh... So now you only wear a hairpin on one side!",
  "str_quest_chat_23802006": "Exactly!",
  "str_quest_chat_23802007": "But... This is the interesting thing I wanted to tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23802008": "Even now, every time I go to bed, I still try to find two hairpins on my head.",
  "str_quest_chat_23802009": "Pfft... You must be too used to taking off two hairpins every time before going to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_23802010": "Yes. But habits are really quite interesting, you see!",
  "str_quest_chat_23802011": "It's like Chandra sometimes pushes on the bridge of her nose even she's not wearing glasses.",
  "str_quest_chat_23802012": "Hmm... that's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_23802013": "Maybe we just have to get used to change, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_23802014": "I feel like you've matured, Vice...",
  "str_quest_chat_23803001": "I have something I must share with you, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_23803002": "Hmm? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23803003": "Today I saw a cute black-and-white kitten!",
  "str_quest_chat_23803004": "Cats are really cute, and there are a lot of people on the Colossus who like cats...",
  "str_quest_chat_23803005": "Plus, it was covered in patches, but had a snowy white tail!",
  "str_quest_chat_23803006": "It enjoyed our petting, especially when we gently patted its buttocks...",
  "str_quest_chat_23803007": "Even Commander Hiiro smiled.",
  "str_quest_chat_23803008": "It is rare to see these kinds of patterns and colors on a cat.",
  "str_quest_chat_23803009": "Was it a mixed breed?",
  "str_quest_chat_23803010": "A mixed-breed kitten...",
  "str_quest_chat_23803011": "I bet so. Like me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23803012": "Very unique.",
  "str_quest_chat_23803013": "Unique...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23803014": "Yeah, from your description, it sounds like a cute kitten.",
  "str_quest_chat_23803015": "... Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_23803016": "Haha! I'm going to go visit it again tomorrow, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_23803017": "I'll keep you posted, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_23803018": "I'm looking forward to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804001": "Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_23804002": "There's something that has been worrying me...",
  "str_quest_chat_23804003": "Do you... have a minute?",
  "str_quest_chat_23804004": "Yes, I'm listening.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804005": "I'll be with you no matter what happens.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804006": "Don't be afraid.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804007": "We'll face it together, no matter what.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804008": "If I'm not mistaken...",
  "str_quest_chat_23804009": "You're still worried about the changes in your body, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_23804010": "Yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat_23804011": "Do you still remember?",
  "str_quest_chat_23804012": "What I told you before about the experimentation that happened in Illumina when I was a child...",
  "str_quest_chat_23804013": "I remember.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804014": "Compared with that experience...",
  "str_quest_chat_23804015": "Maybe this time, the changes in my body were just an accident.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804016": "But I lost some of my memories after that experiment...",
  "str_quest_chat_23804017": "I couldn't remember what had happened or who I had met at that time.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804018": "So I'm worried, if the same thing happens this time, what should I do?",
  "str_quest_chat_23804019": "Are you afraid... that you'll forget things this time too?",
  "str_quest_chat_23804020": "Yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_23804021": "I'm terrified that I might forget everything we've been through together.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804022": "Don't be afraid.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804023": "Even if you do forget, the memories are still with me. I'll tell you everything in detail.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804024": "... Haha, thank you, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_23804025": "But I've found a solution already.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804026": "I'm taking my diary more seriously now!",
  "str_quest_chat_23804027": "In fact, I'll go write down this conversation immediately.",
  "str_quest_chat_23804028": "Okay, I'll take note of it too.",
  "str_quest_chat_23805001": "Got a minute, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_23805002": "I would like you to confirm something with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_23805003": "I'll be waiting for you at the lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat_23805999": "Vice seems to be in some kind of trouble. Go find her in the lounge!",
  "str_quest_chat_23841001": "PlayerName...!",
  "str_quest_chat_23841002": "I've been thinking a lot about my opening line!",
  "str_quest_chat_23841003": "But why?",
  "str_quest_chat_23841004": "Because I can't figure out what to use.",
  "str_quest_chat_23841005": "Should I say \"It's good to see you!\" or \"Hello again!\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_23841006": "They both sound too formal.",
  "str_quest_chat_23841007": "But to maintain a certain degree of politeness, I think I should say...",
  "str_quest_chat_23841008": "I'm glad to see you, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_23841009": "It goes both ways.",
  "str_quest_chat_23841010": "We're finally back on the Colossus. I really missed the smell here.",
  "str_quest_chat_23841011": "This place has a special smell?",
  "str_quest_chat_23841012": "Uh... Maybe it's the smell of \"home\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_23841013": "... \"Home\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_23841014": "You're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_23841015": "A familiar and reassuring place is a home, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_23841016": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_23841017": "Regardless... Welcome back, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_23842001": "We're much more in sync now, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_23842002": "I feel more energized, and my aim has improved...",
  "str_quest_chat_23842003": "I can't take credit for that, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_23842004": "You're very talented on your own.",
  "str_quest_chat_23842005": "No, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_23842006": "As I see it, my own talents don't matter that much...",
  "str_quest_chat_23842007": "Especially when I'm fighting by your side!",
  "str_quest_chat_23842008": "To me, the fact that we're fighting side by side is more important than the idea of me fighting with my own talents.",
  "str_quest_chat_23842009": "... I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_23842010": "Anyway... Please fight by my side more often in the future, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_23843001": "Hey, Navigator, Commander Hiiro praised me!",
  "str_quest_chat_23843002": "Good for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_23843003": "You've really become a lot stronger lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_23843004": "But don't wag your tail.",
  "str_quest_chat_23843005": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_23843006": "How'd you know I was wagging my tail?",
  "str_quest_chat_23843007": "Teehee, I'm happy anyway!",
  "str_quest_chat_23843008": "After all, Commander Hiiro rarely praises anyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_23843009": "What did she say?",
  "str_quest_chat_23843010": "Commander Hiiro said that I'm now able to notice potential threats.",
  "str_quest_chat_23843011": "And that I no longer only focus on attacking enemies before my eyes, but also keep an eye out for those hiding in the dark...",
  "str_quest_chat_23843012": "Hmm... Chief Vivian called it \"risk judgement\" ability, I think.",
  "str_quest_chat_23843013": "Haha, I'm happy for you, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_23843014": "It must be because I've spent most of my time on the Colossus recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_23843015": "So I've been in a good mood. That must've helped make things easier in battles, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23843016": "I never thought the Colossus had such an impact.",
  "str_quest_chat_23843017": "Why of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_23844001": "Navigator, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_23844002": "Coming.",
  "str_quest_chat_23844003": "I learned another new move!",
  "str_quest_chat_23844004": "Ahem, I may be a little too excited.",
  "str_quest_chat_23844005": "They all say I seem to have become calmer, but when I talk to you, it always brings out my true colors.",
  "str_quest_chat_23844006": "What new move could make you so excited?",
  "str_quest_chat_23844007": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_23844008": "Oops, I suddenly don't feel like sharing now.",
  "str_quest_chat_23844009": "It's better for you to see it in person in battle!",
  "str_quest_chat_23844010": "...?",
  "str_quest_chat_23844011": "You're just gonna leave me hanging?",
  "str_quest_chat_23844012": "Haha, if you say so...",
  "str_quest_chat_23844013": "But I got my motivation from you!",
  "str_quest_chat_23844014": "... What motivation?",
  "str_quest_chat_23844015": "Well... in the beginning, it was because I wanted to protect you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23844016": "But now I just want to be a better teammate for you and try to avoid accidents...",
  "str_quest_chat_23844017": "So we can go to more places together, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23844018": "... Well, you're right, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_23844019": "So yeah, Navigator... I'll keep up the hard work!",
  "str_quest_chat_23901001": "Boy, I can lend you my double-edged sword.",
  "str_quest_chat_23901002": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_23901003": "I've been curious about it for a long time!",
  "str_quest_chat_23901004": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_23901005": "But why are you suddenly...",
  "str_quest_chat_23901006": "It's so sudden.",
  "str_quest_chat_23901007": "Why are you suddenly offering?",
  "str_quest_chat_23901008": "Hmph, because you stare at my weapon every day!",
  "str_quest_chat_23901009": "You people always seem so curious about my new buddy!",
  "str_quest_chat_23901010": "In that case, well, thank you very much, Barton!",
  "str_quest_chat_23901011": "To be honest, I've been wanting to play with it for a long time!",
  "str_quest_chat_23901012": "I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23901013": "Oh, by the way, don't let the others know.",
  "str_quest_chat_23901014": "It'll be a hassle if everyone in the army all wants to get their hands on it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23901015": "Understood... I'll keep it a secret!",
  "str_quest_chat_23902001": "The weather in that place was really cold a few days ago.",
  "str_quest_chat_23902002": "A few days ago?",
  "str_quest_chat_23902003": "Oh, I was on a quest.",
  "str_quest_chat_23902004": "Sorry, I can't tell you the exact location, it's confidential.",
  "str_quest_chat_23902005": "It's okay. I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_23902006": "Oh right, I wanted to tell you something.",
  "str_quest_chat_23902007": "Hmm, what?",
  "str_quest_chat_23902008": "Do you remember my coats? Especially the ones with fur collars?",
  "str_quest_chat_23902009": "Of course, I remember them very well.",
  "str_quest_chat_23902010": "Although I usually feel that those frilly things are troublesome in battle since they prick my face...",
  "str_quest_chat_23902011": "But in a place that was so cold, they proved to have excellent windproof capabilities and offered great warmth.",
  "str_quest_chat_23902012": "You should get some for yourself from Umbraton when you're free, 'cause you never know!",
  "str_quest_chat_23902013": "Oh... I see. Thank you for your concern, Barton.",
  "str_quest_chat_23902014": "I didn't know you had such a meticulous side!",
  "str_quest_chat_23902015": "Hmph, when I saw those recruits shivering like newly hatched chicks, I thought of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23902016": "They looked like such pitiful weaklings, I just gave them my coats.",
  "str_quest_chat_23902017": "... A chick? Pitiful weakling? Me?",
  "str_quest_chat_23902018": "... Okay, anyway... Thank you for the suggestion, Barton.",
  "str_quest_chat_23903001": "It suddenly occurred to me today that you don't have it easy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23903002": "Why would you say that all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_23903003": "The notion just popped in my head out of nowhere.",
  "str_quest_chat_23903004": "You only realized that today?!",
  "str_quest_chat_23903005": "At least I did!",
  "str_quest_chat_23903006": "All right...",
  "str_quest_chat_23903007": "What made you think it all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_23903008": "We lost several brothers on our last mission...",
  "str_quest_chat_23903009": "But missions don't listen to my excuses, I still have to work hard to complete my tasks.",
  "str_quest_chat_23903010": "In order to get us some more manpower, I had to bring in some local mercenaries.",
  "str_quest_chat_23903011": "How should I say this... They're very strong in battle, but managing them is really a pain...",
  "str_quest_chat_23903012": "Some of them even like chanting poetry! I really can't stand that!",
  "str_quest_chat_23903013": "Uh... but what does this have to do with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_23903014": "It's the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_23903015": "There are so many messy... I mean, people from different places on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_23903016": "We're all on good terms with you, and you've made this place very cozy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23903017": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_23903018": "Yes... as expected of someone I set my sights upon!",
  "str_quest_chat_23903019": "The door to the 2nd Legion is always open to you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_23903020": "... Is that what this is all about?!",
  "str_quest_chat_23904001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_23904002": "Hey, Barton.",
  "str_quest_chat_23904003": "Listen... Yesterday, I went to a place you probably haven't been to before, and I loved it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23904004": "Being used to the regularity of Illumina, the scenery in that place is particularly eye-opening!",
  "str_quest_chat_23904005": "Really? What is this place?",
  "str_quest_chat_23904006": "It's a barren desert, where the new recruits of Illumina used to carry out their quests.",
  "str_quest_chat_23904007": "It sounds a bit familiar...",
  "str_quest_chat_23904008": "Familiar? Maybe someone's told you about it before!",
  "str_quest_chat_23904009": "I've never heard of it...",
  "str_quest_chat_23904010": "That's normal. The information isn't public, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_23904011": "Hmm... So did anything happen there?",
  "str_quest_chat_23904012": "No, nothing happened.",
  "str_quest_chat_23904013": "I just thought if you went there, you'd love it too!",
  "str_quest_chat_23904014": "It has a different vibe from Eraveil, or any place you've been to before.",
  "str_quest_chat_23904015": "It's very silent, wide, and harsh...",
  "str_quest_chat_23904016": "A place for real men!",
  "str_quest_chat_23904017": "Now that you've put it that way, I really want to go.",
  "str_quest_chat_23904018": "Well, in that case, I'll keep you posted.",
  "str_quest_chat_23904019": "I can take you there! Remember to make time for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23904020": "Sure. Thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_23904021": "No problem.",
  "str_quest_chat_23905001": "Hey, you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_23905002": "Hello, weakling!",
  "str_quest_chat_23905003": "Ah, I'm here! What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_23905004": "Answer quickly if you can hear me!",
  "str_quest_chat_23905005": "Thank you for your help last time in Eraveil.",
  "str_quest_chat_23905006": "(Commander Barton is actually thanking me...)",
  "str_quest_chat_23905007": "Tsk, quit babbling! Come to the bar, I have something to tell you in person!",
  "str_quest_chat_23905999": "Barton seems to be waiting for you in the bar, better hurry.",
  "str_quest_chat_23941001": "We meet again, lad.",
  "str_quest_chat_23941002": "You're not going to react the same way as the others, are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_23941003": "Uh, welcome, Barton...",
  "str_quest_chat_23941004": "But I don't get it. What reaction are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat_23941005": "It's those Illumina people!",
  "str_quest_chat_23941006": "Once they get to know me a little, they come up to greet me, check out my new equipment, and are wowed by it.",
  "str_quest_chat_23941007": "Hmph, as for the unacquainted... they just stay far away and whisper.",
  "str_quest_chat_23941008": "Seriously, I'm tired of dealing with these people's reactions. Don't make me look special!",
  "str_quest_chat_23941009": "Hmm... But honestly, I don't think you look any different...",
  "str_quest_chat_23941010": "You're still Barton, aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_23941011": "No matter what clothes you put on or weapons you wield, you're still you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23941012": "Exactly! That's what I expected, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_23941013": "Uh, thanks, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_23941014": "Have you actually experienced some changes?",
  "str_quest_chat_23941015": "I mean, you didn't come right up and ask me to join your legion like usual...",
  "str_quest_chat_23941016": "Oh, I forgot about that.",
  "str_quest_chat_23941017": "Speaking of which! You've thought about it for long enough, haven't you? I've already updated my equipment once!",
  "str_quest_chat_23941018": "PlayerName, ready to join the 2nd Legion?",
  "str_quest_chat_23941019": "... Sure enough, no matter how you look, you're still the same Barton.",
  "str_quest_chat_23941020": "I told you so!",
  "str_quest_chat_23941021": "Ahem, but regarding the legion, I'll need more time.",
  "str_quest_chat_23941022": "That's lame, boy.",
  "str_quest_chat_23942001": "Blade strike!",
  "str_quest_chat_23942002": "Huh? Are you chanting slogans?",
  "str_quest_chat_23942003": "It's the slogan I shout during training.",
  "str_quest_chat_23942004": "It's mainly used to motivate myself and get me pumped up.",
  "str_quest_chat_23942005": "But recently I feel like I'm making progress again, and I'm wondering if a different slogan would be better.",
  "str_quest_chat_23942006": "What does it matter? As long as it's motivating, it'll do, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23942007": "Well, you're right, the slogan itself doesn't really matter that much.",
  "str_quest_chat_23942008": "It's decided, I'm changing it to \"Recruit the Caelestite!\"",
  "str_quest_chat_23942009": "... Well, now I'm starting to think that the content of the slogan is important too.",
  "str_quest_chat_23943001": "It feels good! Amazing!",
  "str_quest_chat_23943002": "Come again?",
  "str_quest_chat_23943003": "The feeling of increased strength, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_23943004": "For me, the most enjoyable thing is to be able to control power with ease.",
  "str_quest_chat_23943005": "Especially my own power! The boost I get after those hard workouts!",
  "str_quest_chat_23943006": "But of course, I couldn't have done it without your help.",
  "str_quest_chat_23943007": "I'm afraid I can't offer much help when it comes to \"power\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_23943008": "Don't underestimate yourself!",
  "str_quest_chat_23943009": "Your physical training performance is very poor...",
  "str_quest_chat_23943010": "But your accomplishments in military strategy are remarkable!",
  "str_quest_chat_23943011": "... Should I take that as a compliment?",
  "str_quest_chat_23943012": "Of course I'm complimenting you, kid!",
  "str_quest_chat_23943013": "And of course, it's not just a compliment. I'm also saying thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_23943014": "... Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944001": "I've learned something new from battles lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944002": "As expected of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944003": "What I learned may surprise you, Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944004": "Now I'm even more curious!",
  "str_quest_chat_23944005": "What I've learned is to keep calm.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944006": "Who are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_23944007": "Are you really Barton?",
  "str_quest_chat_23944008": "Where did this come from?",
  "str_quest_chat_23944009": "It's hard to imagine you would learn something like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944010": "Man, shouldn't you update the impression of me you have in your head by now?",
  "str_quest_chat_23944011": "All right, all right, I'm listening!",
  "str_quest_chat_23944012": "Generally speaking, well...",
  "str_quest_chat_23944013": "You know how adrenaline spikes when people are fighting, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_23944014": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944015": "Well, that overwhelming, blood-curdling feeling...",
  "str_quest_chat_23944016": "It can be hard to recover from even after the battle is over.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944017": "I feel that I've improved my strength recently, so I've gained a deeper understanding of battles and post-battle reactions.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944018": "Constantly shuffling between the highs of boiling passion and lows of cooling down is very precarious.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944019": "That's very profound...",
  "str_quest_chat_23944020": "So, in order not to let your emotions constantly shift between these two extremes, you should stay calm.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944021": "You're absolutely right.",
  "str_quest_chat_23944022": "The perception of power... really is never ending!",
  "str_quest_chat_24001001": "PlayerName, don't hesitate to ask if you need any help with developing Cloud Gardens.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001002": "Do you still want to turn it into a commercial district?",
  "str_quest_chat_24001003": "I've been working on my world domination plan!",
  "str_quest_chat_24001004": "Thank you for all the hard work.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001005": "What advice do you have this time?",
  "str_quest_chat_24001006": "Nothing has changed much lately here in Cloud Gardens.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001007": "The Unique Trees are really flourishing under the Chubbs' care. It's such a pleasure to enjoy the cool under their shade.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001008": "Sounds like the perfect place for a tea party.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001009": "How lovely it would be to have some refined black tea and refreshments under those colorful Unique Trees!",
  "str_quest_chat_24001010": "We can get Chubbs to play music nearby. I'm sure a good number of noble ladies would attend.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001011": "Chubbs can't play music!",
  "str_quest_chat_24001012": "PlayerName, do you enjoy a tea party?",
  "str_quest_chat_24001013": "Can't tell you. I've never been to one.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001014": "But you seem to like it a lot.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001015": "Of course! A tea party is a perfect occasion to relax your body and mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001016": "I guess those Chubbs could use a tea party.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001017": "It would be a reward for their hard work at Cloud Gardens.",
  "str_quest_chat_24001018": "What!?",
  "str_quest_chat_24001019": "I'll be there at Chubbs' tea party!",
  "str_quest_chat_24002001": "Ah! I hate this!",
  "str_quest_chat_24002002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_24002003": "I hate all the dinner parties Father orders me to attend!",
  "str_quest_chat_24002004": "I hate speaking to those hypocritical ladies.",
  "str_quest_chat_24002005": "I hate it even more when Sanae is bossed around by others...",
  "str_quest_chat_24002006": "I wish you could be there!",
  "str_quest_chat_24002007": "I bet they would be all over you!",
  "str_quest_chat_24002008": "I imagine you are not a fan of such occasions either...",
  "str_quest_chat_24002009": "So you can pretend you suddenly feel dizzy...",
  "str_quest_chat_24002010": "And I'll take you to get some fresh air!",
  "str_quest_chat_24002011": "A perfect plan, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24002012": "A party in Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat_24002013": "Interested?",
  "str_quest_chat_24002014": "Not really. I just...",
  "str_quest_chat_24002015": "Got it. I'll give it some serious thought!",
  "str_quest_chat_24003001": "PlayerName, you better come to see me now.",
  "str_quest_chat_24003002": "What's the matter, Nina?",
  "str_quest_chat_24003003": "Do as I said!",
  "str_quest_chat_24003004": "I'll be at the Cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_24003999": "I don't know what exactly Nina wants, but I better meet her at the Cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_24041001": "Is this the Colossus? Something new for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_24041002": "Well, this room is bigger than I expected.",
  "str_quest_chat_24041003": "The furniture and decor are rather basic. I'd say any utility room in the Andersen mansion is better.",
  "str_quest_chat_24041004": "It can't be that bad...",
  "str_quest_chat_24041005": "You're welcome to decorate your room however you like.",
  "str_quest_chat_24041006": "This room is too small. Better remove this wall to connect two rooms into one.",
  "str_quest_chat_24041007": "That can't happen!",
  "str_quest_chat_24041008": "I guess I'll have to put up with this.",
  "str_quest_chat_24041009": "PlayerName, where's your room?",
  "str_quest_chat_24041010": "What... What do you want?",
  "str_quest_chat_24041011": "Planning a sneak attack at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_24041012": "Dummy! What's wrong with your head?",
  "str_quest_chat_24041013": "I just got here, you will be the person I turn to for all my needs, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_24041014": "I-I'm sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat_24041015": "Are there lights on the Colossus at night?",
  "str_quest_chat_24041016": "Ahem! I don't want to trip and hurt myself in the dark.",
  "str_quest_chat_24041017": "This is definitely part of the Colossus' safety check assessment! I'm no longer afraid of the dark!",
  "str_quest_chat_24041018": "Fireflies are our light sources on the Colossus at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_24041019": "All our corridors are clear of sundries. Don't worry about getting tripped.",
  "str_quest_chat_24041020": "Fireflies? You mean these flying little guys?",
  "str_quest_chat_24041021": "Can they talk?",
  "str_quest_chat_24041022": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_24041023": "What a pity!",
  "str_quest_chat_24042001": "I'm upset now...",
  "str_quest_chat_24042002": "I've never seen Nina troubled before.",
  "str_quest_chat_24042003": "Hey! What are you talking about? Of course I get troubled by things!",
  "str_quest_chat_24042004": "Sorry. I'm just surprised...",
  "str_quest_chat_24042005": "Did you have another fight with your father?",
  "str_quest_chat_24042006": "No. It's something else...",
  "str_quest_chat_24042007": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_24042008": "Costumes I designed on the Colossus were sold out...",
  "str_quest_chat_24042009": "Isn't that a good thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_24042010": "Most of the buyers are members of the Rediesel Wrench!",
  "str_quest_chat_24042011": "Now I'm no longer sure about my taste!",
  "str_quest_chat_24042012": "Who were your original target customers?",
  "str_quest_chat_24042013": "Well, if you must know...",
  "str_quest_chat_24042014": "I wasn't picky...",
  "str_quest_chat_24042015": "Ahem... I mean, I expected some interest from Umbraton!",
  "str_quest_chat_24042016": "Don't you think people in Umbraton have a better sense of fashion?",
  "str_quest_chat_24042017": "You're right, but if Rediesel Wrench members like your design...",
  "str_quest_chat_24042018": "It must be fairly practical.",
  "str_quest_chat_24042019": "Practical?",
  "str_quest_chat_24042020": "Did I spend too much time on the Colossus recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_24042021": "That my own design has been influenced by all the different styles I saw...",
  "str_quest_chat_24042022": "So I achieved unconscious progress?",
  "str_quest_chat_24042023": "I guess so...",
  "str_quest_chat_24042024": "It's hard to believe!",
  "str_quest_chat_24043001": "Heheh! I've got so many ideas lately!",
  "str_quest_chat_24043002": "About fashion design?",
  "str_quest_chat_24043003": "About combat!",
  "str_quest_chat_24043004": "Just the thought of my well-designed weapons defeating those nasty ones...",
  "str_quest_chat_24043005": "It thrills me!",
  "str_quest_chat_24043006": "You have improved, Nina!",
  "str_quest_chat_24043007": "Huh! Of course...",
  "str_quest_chat_24043008": "Hold on! Did you just praise me?",
  "str_quest_chat_24043009": "Keep your compliment to yourself!",
  "str_quest_chat_24043010": "I was simply stating a fact.",
  "str_quest_chat_24043011": "I was simply telling the truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_24043012": "Ahem! In that case...",
  "str_quest_chat_24043013": "I must work on some novel weapons!",
  "str_quest_chat_24043014": "No time to waste. See you around!",
  "str_quest_chat_24043015": "Haha... Bye, Nina.",
  "str_quest_chat_24051001": "Ah! It's morning tea break again!",
  "str_quest_chat_24051002": "I'm getting addicted to scented tea...",
  "str_quest_chat_24051003": "Hey, are you up?",
  "str_quest_chat_24051004": "Orchid black tea or tuberose green tea, which one should I pick?",
  "str_quest_chat_24051005": "Morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_24051006": "Both sound good. Try something new?",
  "str_quest_chat_24051007": "But I've got 36 different kinds of scented tea here to try!",
  "str_quest_chat_24051008": "Err... Black tea then.",
  "str_quest_chat_24051009": "Black tea is quite popular here.",
  "str_quest_chat_24051010": "Hmm... It doesn't hurt to heed your advice!",
  "str_quest_chat_24052001": "Good day.",
  "str_quest_chat_24052002": "I suggest that you fire Soroz's interior designer.",
  "str_quest_chat_24052003": "What's the matter? So early in the morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_24052004": "Why are all the mirrors here neither rectangular nor circular?",
  "str_quest_chat_24052005": "Why can't there be a single symmetrical square mirror?",
  "str_quest_chat_24052006": "It just took me a really, really long time...",
  "str_quest_chat_24052007": "To make sure my bonnet looks perfect like always!",
  "str_quest_chat_24052008": "Err... I've never received such a complaint before...",
  "str_quest_chat_24061001": "Take a guess! What did I have for lunch today?",
  "str_quest_chat_24061002": "A fabulous meal carefully prepared by Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_24061003": "Wrong! I tried some Rediesel BBQ!",
  "str_quest_chat_24061004": "Hmm... Surprise!",
  "str_quest_chat_24061005": "It looked horrible, but the taste was actually quite nice...",
  "str_quest_chat_24061006": "Hmm? I thought that was a Rediesel Wrench specialty. You can get it in Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat_24061007": "Father's caravan passed through the Rediesel Desert on the way back and brought some.",
  "str_quest_chat_24061008": "Hmm... Now I wish I could have some. I miss that special taste.",
  "str_quest_chat_24061009": "I've got a few left. Wanna try?",
  "str_quest_chat_24061010": "I'd hate to throw them away! That's all!",
  "str_quest_chat_24061011": "Are you sure? Anyway, I'd love to have some!",
  "str_quest_chat_24062001": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_24062002": "Just asking. I don't really care. Don't overthink!",
  "str_quest_chat_24062003": "That sounds like care to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_24062004": "I've eaten already. How about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_24062005": "Me too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24062006": "Minos makes sure I consume a proper amount of food on time every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_24062007": "Not like you, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_24062008": "Too obsessed with the restoration of buildings to eat, you passed out on the grass and were carried back by Chubbs that time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24062009": "Please don't bring up that embarrassing accident!",
  "str_quest_chat_24063001": "Phew... So very hot at noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_24063002": "Your skirt has so many layers. It makes perfect sense that you feel hot in it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24063003": "Why not wear something light and airy?",
  "str_quest_chat_24063004": "This afternoon tea party requires formal clothes.",
  "str_quest_chat_24063005": "But you just reminded me.",
  "str_quest_chat_24063006": "My boutique needs to stock some summer dresses.",
  "str_quest_chat_24063007": "I'll do a Caelestite line this summer!",
  "str_quest_chat_24063008": "It will be a hit in Umbraton!",
  "str_quest_chat_24063009": "I've gathered many unique blueprints and patterns from Cloud Gardens.",
  "str_quest_chat_24063010": "I'm more than happy to share with you under one condition...",
  "str_quest_chat_24063011": "I'll take a cut.",
  "str_quest_chat_24063012": "PlayerName, you've got some business sense.",
  "str_quest_chat_24063013": "Sure. We have a deal.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081001": "I've been having trouble sleeping lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081002": "Is there something troubling you during the day?",
  "str_quest_chat_24081003": "During the day?",
  "str_quest_chat_24081004": "I go to the Dawn Academy as usual and inspect my stores.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081005": "That sounds busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081006": "I review my lessons at night and keep books.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081007": "That's very impressive, Nina. I would have fallen asleep on the textbooks if I were you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081008": "How is it possible? The textbooks are giving me a headache.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081009": "Hey, I might be able to help you fall asleep quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081010": "Continue.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081011": "You can count Chubbs. Lying in your bed, silently you count, \"One Chubb, two Chubbs...\"",
  "str_quest_chat_24081012": "I can rarely make it to 100.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081013": "For real? I'll give it a try.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081014": "One Chubb, two Chubbs, three Chubbs, four Chubbs...",
  "str_quest_chat_24081015": "Is it working?",
  "str_quest_chat_24081016": "Nina?",
  "str_quest_chat_24081017": "Nina?",
  "str_quest_chat_24081018": "Already asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_24081019": "Night, Nina.",
  "str_quest_chat_24082001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_24082002": "You're still up?",
  "str_quest_chat_24082003": "I'm already in bed. And my doggy is right by my pillow.",
  "str_quest_chat_24082004": "Well... That sounds lovely.",
  "str_quest_chat_24082005": "I was brushing my doggy, and its tangled hair reminded me of yours!",
  "str_quest_chat_24082006": "You didn't compare me to a dog, did you?",
  "str_quest_chat_24082007": "Obviously I was... Never mind!",
  "str_quest_chat_24082008": "You weren't thinking about combing my hair, were you?",
  "str_quest_chat_24082009": "You... What are you talking about?",
  "str_quest_chat_24082010": "I just wanted to say goodnight!",
  "str_quest_chat_24101001": "Mr. Navigator... Are you busy?",
  "str_quest_chat_24101002": "Is there anything I can help you with?",
  "str_quest_chat_24101003": "Not at the moment.",
  "str_quest_chat_24101004": "How were you on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_24101005": "I'm very happy here!",
  "str_quest_chat_24101006": "Food is tasty. It's super safe everywhere...",
  "str_quest_chat_24101007": "When no one is around, I'd sneak out to play some games.",
  "str_quest_chat_24101008": "You don't like the people on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_24101009": "I never said that! I... I'm not used to such a social setting...",
  "str_quest_chat_24101010": "Besides... I feel guilty for having all this fun without doing any work.",
  "str_quest_chat_24101011": "This is new to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_24101012": "I bet bosses in Umbraton love staff like you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24101013": "Huh? R-Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_24101014": "But I could never keep a job for long...",
  "str_quest_chat_24101015": "What jobs have you tried?",
  "str_quest_chat_24101016": "I helped my family farm and transport grains when I was little.",
  "str_quest_chat_24101017": "Then I did all kinds of odd tasks in an izakaya.",
  "str_quest_chat_24101018": "After coming to Umbraton, I worked as a porter, a mail person, a kitchen helper, and a bookkeeper...",
  "str_quest_chat_24101019": "I was once a fighter and an investigator too...",
  "str_quest_chat_24101020": "Your choices of jobs are getting wild...",
  "str_quest_chat_24101021": "That's a very rich life if you ask me...",
  "str_quest_chat_24101022": "However, I was a maid for the longest.",
  "str_quest_chat_24101023": "Anyway... there is something I want to say, Mr. Navigator.",

  "str_quest_chat_24102001": "Ahhhhhhhhhhh!",
  "str_quest_chat_24102002": "Uhh? Sanae, are you okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_24102003": "Ah... Thank you for your concern, Mr. Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_24102004": "I think I just had a bad dream...",
  "str_quest_chat_24102005": "My parents left me with Uncle Hansuke...",
  "str_quest_chat_24102006": "Ah! Why am I telling you this?",
  "str_quest_chat_24102007": "It's okay. I'm more than happy to hear if you want to share, Sanae!",
  "str_quest_chat_24102008": "Mr. Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_24102009": "I knew it was a wise move to come to Astra...",
  "str_quest_chat_24102010": "On Cloud Island, only Manae had time for my stories.",
  "str_quest_chat_24102011": "Then I met Lady Bethel and Miss Nina in Umbraton...",
  "str_quest_chat_24102012": "And you! You've been taking such good care of me...",
  "str_quest_chat_24102013": "Please. I didn't do anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_24102014": "You are my friend. Taking care of a friend is nothing worth mentioning.",
  "str_quest_chat_24102015": "Friend...",
  "str_quest_chat_24102016": "Ah! Do you have laundry to do? Is there any particular dish you are craving?",
  "str_quest_chat_24102017": "Or is there anything you need to move? I'm very strong!",
  "str_quest_chat_24102018": "But why?",
  "str_quest_chat_24102019": "Because you are my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_24102020": "I want to take care of you, Mr. Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_24102021": "Thank you, Sanae. I'll definitely come to you when I need help.",
  "str_quest_chat_24102022": "I am awaiting your orders!",
  "str_quest_chat_24142001": "... Mr. Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142002": "What shall I do? I feel Manae doesn't want to talk to me recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142003": "Manae doesn't talk to you?",
  "str_quest_chat_24142004": "It never happened before...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142005": "When mom left Manae with me, I thought she was a puppet.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142006": "I still think so...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142007": "Manae is not a puppet... She's not!",
  "str_quest_chat_24142008": "I don't.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142009": "A doll certainly can't talk that much...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142010": "Right. Manae is so much better than me.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142011": "At first, mom didn't teach me witchcraft...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142012": "Witchcraft?",
  "str_quest_chat_24142013": "Actually I don't quite understand myself. It's probably similar to your Luminatics.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142014": "Mom was not a priestess, but she used to perform religious rites in the village.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142015": "I began hearing Manae's voice after I learned some witchcraft from mom.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142016": "I see... But why is she in a puppet body?",
  "str_quest_chat_24142017": "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142018": "It's fine, Mr. Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142019": "I overheard mom talking. Manae and I were twins.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142020": "But only I survived...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142021": "I guess mom kept Manae's soul inside this puppet using her witchcraft.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142022": "You guess...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142023": "Whenever I'm in danger or bullied by someone, Manae will show up.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142024": "She will scold those bad guys harshly...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142025": "Manae is one hundred times braver than me. Sometimes I can't help thinking how much better it would be if she were the one who survived.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142026": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142027": "Did I do something wrong that upset Manae recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_24142028": "I don't think so.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142029": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_24142030": "Quite the opposite, you're safe and happy here, nothing for Manae to worry about.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142031": "So she doesn't appear as often.",
  "str_quest_chat_24142032": "But... For so many years, she was all I had... Boo-hoo...",
  "str_quest_chat_24142033": "Ah... Are you crying?",
  "str_quest_chat_24142034": "What happened? Why did you make Sanae cry?",
  "str_quest_chat_24142035": "Manae?",
  "str_quest_chat_24142036": "Ahhhh! Manae is back! Thank you for getting her back to me, Mr. Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_24142037": "Err... Don't worry about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24151001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_24151002": "Mr. Navigator... I'm sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat_24151003": "Sanae? What's the matter so early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_24151004": "Ahhh... You're awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_24151005": "Of course. I finished breakfast already.",
  "str_quest_chat_24151006": "Ah... you have finished...",
  "str_quest_chat_24151007": "What kind of question is that?",
  "str_quest_chat_24151008": "I... I was just about to bring breakfast to your room.",
  "str_quest_chat_24151009": "But I fell again after a few steps.",
  "str_quest_chat_24151010": "I apologize... I'm really sorry!",
  "str_quest_chat_24151011": "Thank goodness the plate is alright. But the food doesn't look good anymore...",
  "str_quest_chat_24151012": "Thank you, Sanae. The most important thing is you're alright!",
  "str_quest_chat_24151013": "I'll get Fireflies to clean it up.",
  "str_quest_chat_24151014": "Oh... It was all because of me. I can fix this!",
  "str_quest_chat_24151015": "Please... Please don't send me away.",
  "str_quest_chat_24151016": "Never!",
  "str_quest_chat_24151017": "Sanae? Are you still there?",
  "str_quest_chat_24151018": "Yes, sir! Don't worry. Everything is clean now!",
  "str_quest_chat_24151019": "I'm working hard...",
  "str_quest_chat_24151020": "You have my word. I'll never ask you to leave. Alright?",
  "str_quest_chat_24151021": "Thank you, Mr. Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_24152001": "Hey! Wake up!",
  "str_quest_chat_24152002": "You lazy cat! Even ants are busy moving already. How much longer do you plan to stay in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_24152003": "Err... Sanae?",
  "str_quest_chat_24152004": "Wait. You must be Manae. But can Manae send messages?",
  "str_quest_chat_24152005": "Heh. At least you know I'm Manae! I guess you are sober now.",
  "str_quest_chat_24152006": "Yeah, I just woke up.",
  "str_quest_chat_24152007": "Morning. Please give Sanae my best regards.",
  "str_quest_chat_24152008": "Can't help you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24152009": "I've been awake for quite a while already.",
  "str_quest_chat_24152010": "Liars must swallow one thousand needles!",
  "str_quest_chat_24152011": "Sanae lost her voice trying to wake you up earlier, but you slept like a dead man.",
  "str_quest_chat_24152012": "Really? I can't recall anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_24152013": "That's enough!",
  "str_quest_chat_24152014": "Don't make it Sanae's responsibility to get you up in the morning ever again. You heard me?",
  "str_quest_chat_24152015": "If this happens again, I'll snatch the quilt off you and tickle you until you cry!",
  "str_quest_chat_24152016": "No! I swear...",
  "str_quest_chat_24161001": "Oh... Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_24161002": "Good afternoon. Is everything okay, Sanae?",
  "str_quest_chat_24161003": "Mr. Navigator... Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_24161004": "May I take the leftover ingredients from lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_24161005": "Do you want to help with food waste?",
  "str_quest_chat_24161006": "Fireflies can handle this.",
  "str_quest_chat_24161007": "Hmm... Not like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_24161008": "After cutting off the yellow pieces, these leftover leaves are more than enough for a new dish...",
  "str_quest_chat_24161009": "And those fruit pits. They could be a tasty snack if I open them up and dry them under the sun...",
  "str_quest_chat_24161010": "Are you still hungry? I can get Fireflies to bring you some fresh ingredients!",
  "str_quest_chat_24161011": "Thank you for your generosity, sir!",
  "str_quest_chat_24161012": "I... I'm used to being thrifty. I don't like to waste food.",
  "str_quest_chat_24161013": "Ahh... I don't mean to blame you... It's just...",
  "str_quest_chat_24161014": "Can't imagine how much you've been through before we met...",
  "str_quest_chat_24161015": "Fine... Please be very careful. I don't want you to get food poison!",
  "str_quest_chat_24161016": "And that black dish... I don't think anyone is eating it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24161017": "Hmm? Did someone get creative in the kitchen again?",
  "str_quest_chat_24161018": "Please don't touch that...",
  "str_quest_chat_24162001": "Mr. Navigator... It's already noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_24162002": "When are we setting out?",
  "str_quest_chat_24162003": "Hmm? Where are we going?",
  "str_quest_chat_24162004": "Oops... Did I remember it wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_24162005": "You said you wanted to try the new buffet restaurant in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_24162006": "And then watch a hot show in some opera house in Lumopolis...",
  "str_quest_chat_24162007": "After, you wanted to see the legendary aurora in Northland.",
  "str_quest_chat_24162008": "That sounds like a date...",
  "str_quest_chat_24162009": "Ahh... Please don't take me wrong. I'm going with you as your maid...",
  "str_quest_chat_24162010": "But it doesn't sound like a plan I would make.",
  "str_quest_chat_24162011": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_24162012": "Ah... I must be daydreaming again...",
  "str_quest_chat_24162013": "Is that so? An afternoon dream can be very confusing.",
  "str_quest_chat_24162014": "Ahh... Err... Woooaaahhh...",
  "str_quest_chat_24162015": "How can I face you ever again...",
  "str_quest_chat_24163001": "Good morning, Mr. Navigator...",
  "str_quest_chat_24163002": "Good morning? Did you just wake up?",
  "str_quest_chat_24163003": "Ahhhh! I mean, good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_24163004": "I... I've been awake for a long time. I don't know why I said that...",
  "str_quest_chat_24163005": "It's alright. After all, it's not that long since I woke up, so good morning's perfectly fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_24163006": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_24163007": "Mr. Navigator, aren't you kind of... lazy?",
  "str_quest_chat_24181001": "Good night...",
  "str_quest_chat_24181002": "Haha. Sanae! Already in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_24181003": "Hmm... Yes!",
  "str_quest_chat_24181004": "I got nothing else to do, so...",
  "str_quest_chat_24181005": "Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. Navigator? I'll get to it right away!",
  "str_quest_chat_24181006": "Nothing. Sanae, have you made any friends on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_24181007": "Err... Not really...",
  "str_quest_chat_24181008": "I believe the bar is quite busy at this hour.",
  "str_quest_chat_24181009": "Check it out if you want to meet others.",
  "str_quest_chat_24181010": "... An izakaya?",
  "str_quest_chat_24181011": "Yeah, it's similar to the izakaya on Cloud Island.",
  "str_quest_chat_24181012": "Hey! Watch your tongue!",
  "str_quest_chat_24181013": "Don't you know Sanae was locked up in an izakaya where she had little to eat but a lot of work to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_24181014": "I wasn't aware of this...",
  "str_quest_chat_24181015": "Now you know.",
  "str_quest_chat_24181016": "I heard a little about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24181017": "How could you make such an awful suggestion then?",
  "str_quest_chat_24181018": "I, I...",
  "str_quest_chat_24181019": "Ahh... That was Manae earlier.",
  "str_quest_chat_24181020": "She wanted to protect me... Please don't feel offended!",
  "str_quest_chat_24181021": "Not at all... I should have been more thoughtful.",
  "str_quest_chat_24181022": "You've worked really hard. Have a good rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_24181023": "So I don't have to meet other people? Hooray!",
  "str_quest_chat_24182001": "Good evening, Mr. Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_24182002": "Do you need sleeping assistance?",
  "str_quest_chat_24182003": "Sleeping assistance?",
  "str_quest_chat_24182004": "Yes, I'll wash your hair, blow it dry, massage your head, and tell you a bedtime story.",
  "str_quest_chat_24182005": "I do these for Miss Nina every night.",
  "str_quest_chat_24182006": "Sounds wonderful...",
  "str_quest_chat_24182007": "I don't have much experience with all these, but Miss Nina said I was doing well.",
  "str_quest_chat_24182008": "She falls asleep at the very beginning of my story every time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24182009": "Very tempting...",
  "str_quest_chat_24182010": "Don't you dare abuse Sanae!",
  "str_quest_chat_24182011": "I'll poke your armpit!",
  "str_quest_chat_24182012": "... Manae? You're so very different from Sanae.",
  "str_quest_chat_24182013": "Hmm... I'm sorry, sir.",
  "str_quest_chat_24182014": "Manae doesn't want me to work at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_24182015": "Ahem... that won't be necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat_24182016": "Sanae, I appreciate your kind offer!",
  "str_quest_chat_24182017": "Hmm... Are you sure? I thought I could make some pocket money...",
  "str_quest_chat_24182018": "Hopefully you're able to rest well without my assistance... Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_24182019": "G-Good night...",
  "str_quest_chat_24201001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24201002": "Yes, Carleen?",
  "str_quest_chat_24201003": "I noticed purple flowers blooming in Lower Lumopolis yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat_24201004": "It was a fine day, and people wore happy smiles on their faces.",
  "str_quest_chat_24201005": "A guard caught a stumbling little girl.",
  "str_quest_chat_24201006": "That sounds wonderful.",
  "str_quest_chat_24201007": "It was. It was such a leisurely stroll...",
  "str_quest_chat_24201008": "It would've been lovely if you'd been there.",
  "str_quest_chat_24201009": "Witnessing a tranquil city brings a satisfying peace of mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_24201010": "PlayerName, the next time I go...",
  "str_quest_chat_24201011": "Would you like to come with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_24201012": "... Alright.",
  "str_quest_chat_24201013": "Then let us go together next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_24202001": "PlayerName, do you remember",
  "str_quest_chat_24202002": "the first time we visited Eraveil?",
  "str_quest_chat_24202003": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202004": "When we returned to Lumopolis, I found rogue dandelion seeds clinging to my shirt.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202005": "I... didn't remove them then.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202006": "I felt that they represented a cherished memory.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202007": "So I planted them in a flowerpot.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202008": "Today... they sprouted little seedlings.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202009": "That's impressive, Carleen!",
  "str_quest_chat_24202010": "Thank you. It was a very rudimentary planting technique, I feel.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202011": "Such attention to detail!",
  "str_quest_chat_24202012": "No, not really. I discovered them unintentionally.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202013": "However, dandelions do signify beautiful things to come...",
  "str_quest_chat_24202014": "Yeah, I think...",
  "str_quest_chat_24202015": "I'll probably make a small wish when they bloom.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202016": "What will you wish for, Carleen?",
  "str_quest_chat_24202017": "Oh! Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202018": "That's alright.",
  "str_quest_chat_24202019": "When the time comes, perhaps I'll be most happy to tell you...",
  "str_quest_chat_24202020": "my wish.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203001": "PlayerName, how are you today?",
  "str_quest_chat_24203002": "I've seen better days.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203003": "I dabbled in calligraphy today. I didn't improve much.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203004": "I decided to write a story, and was hit by writer's block half way...",
  "str_quest_chat_24203005": "Then I decided to do some exercise.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203006": "But thanks to my sedentary lifestyle as of late, it totally wore me out...",
  "str_quest_chat_24203007": "Not bad!",
  "str_quest_chat_24203008": "I tried my hand at calligraphy today. I think I've gotten a lot better at it...",
  "str_quest_chat_24203009": "I even tried to write a story. It was hilarious reading it back to myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203010": "I just finished exercising. I'm full of energy now!",
  "str_quest_chat_24203011": "Oh, come to think of it, why did you ask me how I was feeling, Carleen?",
  "str_quest_chat_24203012": "Because I think feelings are important to every individual.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203013": "And... I'm happy to listen to you share or vent about the things in your life.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203014": "No matter whether you're frustrated or infuriated...",
  "str_quest_chat_24203015": "Whether you are cheery or elated, I'm always willing to be your audience.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203016": "Those are some heartwarming words.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203017": "Oh really? I was simply speaking my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203018": "How are you feeling today then, Carleen?",
  "str_quest_chat_24203019": "I believe that listening goes both ways. So, I want to be your listener, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24203020": "Well, I'm in a better mood after reading this message!",
  "str_quest_chat_24203021": "Haha, I'm also in a better mood.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204001": "PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_24204002": "Yes, Carleen?",
  "str_quest_chat_24204003": "I visited Dawn Academy today.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204004": "To study?",
  "str_quest_chat_24204005": "Not exactly. I just wanted to look around.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204006": "The instruction, security, and students...",
  "str_quest_chat_24204007": "How did it go?",
  "str_quest_chat_24204008": "Everything went smoothly.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204009": "Only... it got me thinking...",
  "str_quest_chat_24204010": "What would it be like if you were to study there?",
  "str_quest_chat_24204011": "I spent some time today imagining you as a student.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204012": "Me? I'd probably be the dumb one...",
  "str_quest_chat_24204013": "Physical education classes would be even worse...",
  "str_quest_chat_24204014": "I bet you'd excel in everything!",
  "str_quest_chat_24204015": "Ah, I forgot... you went to school in Northland.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204016": "We've never been schoolmates, which is what got me wondering.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204017": "Daydreaming these scenarios is fun.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204018": "Mm, I'd love the opportunity to be your classmate!",
  "str_quest_chat_24204019": "You think so too, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_24204020": "However, I'd say we're closer than just ordinary classmates at this point.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204021": "We've skipped the buildup and arrived directly at the destination. That's great, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204022": "Haha, that's true. And we've been through so much more than ordinary schoolmates!",
  "str_quest_chat_24204023": "You're right, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204024": "I enjoy experiencing new things with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24204025": "Me too, Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat_24205001": "Hello, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24205002": "I'd like to invite you to Lower Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_24205003": "Are you free today?",
  "str_quest_chat_24205004": "If you're willing to accompany me today, let me know.",
  "str_quest_chat_24205005": "Sure, no problem.",
  "str_quest_chat_24205006": "I'll wait for you on the bridge.",

  "str_quest_chat_24241001": "It's great to see you again, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24241002": "Sorry, I've made the situation so serious by being too formal. I'm in a good mood, actually.",
  "str_quest_chat_24241003": "Is it because of your outfit?",
  "str_quest_chat_24241004": "That's one of the reasons, yes...",
  "str_quest_chat_24241005": "I feel that this outfit helps clear things up in my mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_24241006": "I... sort of understand what you're saying...",
  "str_quest_chat_24241007": "We've digressed and become formal again. That wasn't my intention.",
  "str_quest_chat_24241008": "Haha, you can relax sometimes, Carleen!",
  "str_quest_chat_24241009": "Right, that's also why I'm in a good mood.",
  "str_quest_chat_24241010": "I feel very relaxed talking to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24241011": "Anyway... I'm happy, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24241012": "Me, too! It's great to see you again, Carleen!",
  "str_quest_chat_24242001": "PlayerName, how are your plans going this year?",
  "str_quest_chat_24242002": "Um... that's a difficult question to answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242003": "Even if you achieved just a small goal, it's still a victory.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242004": "Adhering to the plans you've made is better than doing nothing at all, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_24242005": "Well, I suppose you're right...",
  "str_quest_chat_24242006": "I'm going that... sort of...",
  "str_quest_chat_24242007": "I did accomplish a few things. But, looking back...",
  "str_quest_chat_24242008": "I feel like the goals I set for myself were overly idealistic.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242009": "How are your goals coming along, Carleen?",
  "str_quest_chat_24242010": "Do you want to know the truth?",
  "str_quest_chat_24242011": "... It seems you're further along than I am.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242012": "Yes, I'd say I'm about nearly a hundred percent of the way there.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242013": "Crime rates in Lower Lumopolis are on the decline, residents have a lot more security.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242014": "Your drive is incomparable!",
  "str_quest_chat_24242015": "You think so? I always thought that it was because I met you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242016": "Me? I don't really think I helped you much in this regard though...",
  "str_quest_chat_24242017": "I set pretty balanced goals for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242018": "Like, I can only relax and chat with friends after I've completed my duties.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242019": "So, the prospect of talking to you is what drives me to finish my work.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242020": "It goes without saying then that my success is largely due to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24242021": "Since you put it that way...",
  "str_quest_chat_24242022": "Alright then, I'll always be on the lookout for your messages!",
  "str_quest_chat_24243001": "A new batch of Guardians arrived today.",
  "str_quest_chat_24243002": "Are they like new recruits?",
  "str_quest_chat_24243003": "Yeah, something like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_24243004": "Are you responsible for training them?",
  "str_quest_chat_24243005": "That's not my job, but I did audit their training today.",
  "str_quest_chat_24243006": "Today was different from the last few times...",
  "str_quest_chat_24243007": "Oh?",
  "str_quest_chat_24243008": "The way they looked at me... how should I put it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24243009": "Compared to previous newbies, their eyes lacked suspicion and judgment.",
  "str_quest_chat_24243010": "And contained more trust and respect.",
  "str_quest_chat_24243011": "Isn't that a good thing? It means that you've become more reliable in their eyes, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_24243012": "Yeah, it's what I've been working towards all along.",
  "str_quest_chat_24243013": "Although I'm under a lot of pressure...",
  "str_quest_chat_24243014": "It's a clear indication of how far I've come.",
  "str_quest_chat_24243015": "That's really great news.",
  "str_quest_chat_24243016": "I guess, that's why I'm telling you first.",
  "str_quest_chat_24243017": "You've always been very supportive of me, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_24243018": "I'm glad I was able to be of help to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_24244001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244002": "Yeah, Carleen?",
  "str_quest_chat_24244003": "Um... I don't know how to say this.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244004": "But despite the fact that things have been going pretty smoothly as of late... I'm still troubled by miscellaneous things.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244005": "Isn't things going smoothly a good thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_24244006": "It is.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244007": "I'm always ready for action, rain or shine, treating everyone with kindness.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244008": "I have a healthy appetite, and my combat skills have improved greatly.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244009": "I've even made progress in my studies.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244010": "Is it your success that's bothering you?",
  "str_quest_chat_24244011": "... I have this feeling that things may be going too well.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244012": "I see!",
  "str_quest_chat_24244013": "You're just not able to enjoy having peace of mind, am I right?",
  "str_quest_chat_24244014": "Hmm... you think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_24244015": "Yes, it's rare for you to be in this state.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244016": "Perhaps you're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244017": "You don't have to be so tense every second of every day, and you certainly don't need to be on the constant lookout for danger...",
  "str_quest_chat_24244018": "I guess I need to take a break once in a while, is that what you're saying?",
  "str_quest_chat_24244019": "Bingo!",
  "str_quest_chat_24244020": "I'm always able to gain unexpected insight from you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244021": "Is that a compliment?",
  "str_quest_chat_24244022": "It sure is. It's also a show of gratitude.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244023": "Alright then, I'll set aside water breaks for myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_24244024": "... You don't need to start right this second!",
  "str_quest_chat_24301001": "Navigator, d-do you want a gift?",
  "str_quest_chat_24301002": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_24301003": "Um... not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_24301004": "Why all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_24301005": "D-don't worry, it's something you need.",
  "str_quest_chat_24301006": "You've got my attention.",
  "str_quest_chat_24301007": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24301008": "Leg armor!",
  "str_quest_chat_24301009": "L-leg armor? Isn't that super heavy?!",
  "str_quest_chat_24301010": "Yeah, but you can travel long distances with it on!",
  "str_quest_chat_24301011": "Oh, how so?",
  "str_quest_chat_24301012": "We waste unnecessary energy while walking because of poor posture habits!",
  "str_quest_chat_24301013": "By wearing special gear that can conserve this energy...",
  "str_quest_chat_24301014": "You'll be able to draw on it to travel further!",
  "str_quest_chat_24301015": "That's amazing, even though I'm a little confused.",
  "str_quest_chat_24301016": "Don't worry about the nitty-gritty. I'll run some tests and bring it to you when it's ready!",
  "str_quest_chat_24301017": "So it still needs work...",
  "str_quest_chat_24302001": "Do you ever worry sometimes?",
  "str_quest_chat_24302002": "Worry?",
  "str_quest_chat_24302003": "The Colossus is so big and sophisticated. It must be really difficult to maintain, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_24302004": "What if it gets punctured and starts to leak?",
  "str_quest_chat_24302005": "You're also responsible for daily navigation. Now that I think about it, you're really impressive!",
  "str_quest_chat_24302006": "I mean... not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_24302007": "I usually order Fireflies to do the repairs.",
  "str_quest_chat_24302008": "They take care of the things that need fixing.",
  "str_quest_chat_24302009": "So do they work 24/7?",
  "str_quest_chat_24302010": "I think so. If we're really short-handed...",
  "str_quest_chat_24302011": "we'd need to take the Colossus offline. Luckily, Fireflies can repair one another, so it's fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_24302012": "I'm filled with admiration for this glorious Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_24341001": "Navigator, I have exciting news for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_24341002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24341003": "Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat_24341004": "You didn't ask why I'm congratulating you...",
  "str_quest_chat_24341005": "You're reacting so proactively that I guess it must be something exciting.",
  "str_quest_chat_24341006": "Indeed... let me tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24341007": "I was able to do a handstand for one whole minute wearing the leg armor today!",
  "str_quest_chat_24341008": "H-Have you been training your upper body strength?",
  "str_quest_chat_24341009": "No, I created an arm support system.",
  "str_quest_chat_24341010": "It helps evenly distribute energy, enhancing the wearer's agility! It's like having new and improved arms!",
  "str_quest_chat_24341011": "That sounds awesome! Can it use weapons?",
  "str_quest_chat_24341012": "Of course. It's just the fingers need some more work.",
  "str_quest_chat_24341013": "If I'm successful, you'll even be able to use it to eat with a knife and fork!",
  "str_quest_chat_24341014": "I'm off to run some more tests!",
  "str_quest_chat_24341015": "Huh? Alright, good luck!",
  "str_quest_chat_24342001": "Thank you, Navigator!",
  "str_quest_chat_24342002": "Huh? For what?",
  "str_quest_chat_24342003": "I got some new inspiration watching the Colossus today.",
  "str_quest_chat_24342004": "The joints of the support structure don't necessarily need to be rigid!",
  "str_quest_chat_24342005": "I can use soft joints!",
  "str_quest_chat_24342006": "I'm not following...",
  "str_quest_chat_24342007": "Also, I can install a malleable suspension system!",
  "str_quest_chat_24342008": "That would double the control with half the effort.",
  "str_quest_chat_24342009": "I'm still not following...",
  "str_quest_chat_24342010": "Oh, I've rambled on, haven't I?",
  "str_quest_chat_24342011": "Sorry, going off on a tangent is a bad habit of mine...",
  "str_quest_chat_24342012": "No worries, I'm used to it by now...",
  "str_quest_chat_24342013": "Anyway, I wanted to congratulate you first.",
  "str_quest_chat_24342014": "Thank you and your Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_24351001": "Hi, Navigator. How did you sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_24351002": "Alright, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat_24351003": "You look tired, though.",
  "str_quest_chat_24351004": "My bed is a little... hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_24351005": "But I think it's super soft...",
  "str_quest_chat_24351006": "Because I usually sleep in a hammock at home.",
  "str_quest_chat_24351007": "I only sleep in an actual bed at work, and I always have to force myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_24351008": "So, if it's at all possible, could I have a hammock instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_24351009": "No problem. Just tell the Fireflies, and they'll change it for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24351010": "Oh, that's it? That's great!",
  "str_quest_chat_24361001": "Navigator, are you taking a nap?",
  "str_quest_chat_24361002": "No, but I could use one.",
  "str_quest_chat_24361003": "Noon is an important time of the day, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat_24361004": "You can use it to read or create designs.",
  "str_quest_chat_24361005": "It seems you have a lot of responsibilities aboard the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_24361006": "I offload a lot of them... to the Fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat_24361007": "In any case, you need to be more efficient with your time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24362001": "Hi, I need a pick-me-up drink.",
  "str_quest_chat_24362002": "Coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat_24362003": "Tea?",
  "str_quest_chat_24362004": "In the middle of the day? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_24362005": "Lately, I've been feeling very drowsy in the afternoons.",
  "str_quest_chat_24362006": "It's probably because I study during lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_24362007": "Well, you should take a break during that time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24381001": "Navigator, may I ask how you usually fall asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_24381002": "Fall asleep? The usual way, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat_24381003": "Do you fall asleep quickly?",
  "str_quest_chat_24381004": "Do you wear anything special to bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_24381005": "Special?",
  "str_quest_chat_24381006": "I thought you'd wear that Caelestite uniform to bed or fall asleep hugging a Firefly.",
  "str_quest_chat_24381007": "Like how I wear leg armor to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_24381008": "I think that's just you...",
  "str_quest_chat_24401001": "What does \"youth\" mean, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_24401002": "Well... \"Youth\" isn't something that can fully be explained in just one or two sentences.",
  "str_quest_chat_24401003": "And aren't you too young to be asking about \"youth\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_24401004": "Shouldn't you be focused on eating, sleeping, and studying instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_24401005": "Hmmph, I can explain what \"youth\" is.",
  "str_quest_chat_24401006": "It all starts with a small group of like-minded friends!",
  "str_quest_chat_24401007": "Everyone plays together and has loads of fun!",
  "str_quest_chat_24401008": "And then, everyone will become the best of friends!",
  "str_quest_chat_24401009": "After that, everyone will embark on an adventure together and experience many unforgettable things!",
  "str_quest_chat_24401010": "This clearly explains what youth is.",
  "str_quest_chat_24401011": "Well, if you put it that way, I guess it's true.",
  "str_quest_chat_24401012": "Then, in that case...",
  "str_quest_chat_24401013": "I want to live like a \"youth\", too!",
  "str_quest_chat_24401014": "If PlayerName goes on an adventure in the future, you must bring me along!",
  "str_quest_chat_24401015": "I... I can't promise anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_24401016": "However, if the trip isn't a dangerous one, I'll consider it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24401017": "Hehe, I'll accept that.",
  "str_quest_chat_24402001": "Wh-what should I do, PlayerName?!",
  "str_quest_chat_24402002": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_24402003": "I, I...",
  "str_quest_chat_24402004": "Take a deep breath.",
  "str_quest_chat_24402005": "Deep breath... Phew, deep breath...",
  "str_quest_chat_24402006": "... No! Now's not the time for that!",
  "str_quest_chat_24402007": "I feel really strange right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_24402008": "What's with these annoying gushy, gooey feelings?",
  "str_quest_chat_24402009": "It, it feels like a big loaf of bread with sugar rolling around in my heart...",
  "str_quest_chat_24402010": "I've never felt this way before!",
  "str_quest_chat_24402011": "Hmm... What you just described... Isn't that a happy feeling?",
  "str_quest_chat_24402012": "I guess so, but it isn't a happy feeling I've ever had!",
  "str_quest_chat_24402013": "Ahhh, it's coming, it's coming again...",
  "str_quest_chat_24402014": "No, I need to figure out where this feeling is coming from!",
  "str_quest_chat_24402015": "Since I've only felt this way on the Colossus, I'm going to—",
  "str_quest_chat_24402016": "Investigate every nook and cranny of the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_24441001": "Hey, it's me! It's Fia!",
  "str_quest_chat_24441002": "I really don't get why I still need to introduce myself...",
  "str_quest_chat_24441003": "Err, I'm not sure if that's actually necessary.",
  "str_quest_chat_24441004": "But everyone says that when they come to the Colossus, they greet you first!",
  "str_quest_chat_24441005": "Ahem, as for that... You don't have to do it if you don't want to.",
  "str_quest_chat_24441006": "I, I didn't say I didn't want to.",
  "str_quest_chat_24441007": "And since everyone else is doing it, well, Kyllo, come say hello!",
  "str_quest_chat_24441008": "@##￥￥%%... @#",
  "str_quest_chat_24441009": "... Never mind. Kyllo wouldn't be using this Terminal to talk. I should have known.",
  "str_quest_chat_24441010": "Anyway, see you again!",
  "str_quest_chat_24441011": "Alright, welcome aboard, Fia.",
  "str_quest_chat_24442001": "PlayerName! PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_24442002": "I saw something new today!",
  "str_quest_chat_24442003": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24442004": "Hehe...",
  "str_quest_chat_24442005": "I saw little snakes shedding their skins!",
  "str_quest_chat_24442006": "Wow, okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_24442007": "But don't you find it a little scary...",
  "str_quest_chat_24442008": "I can't stand them!",
  "str_quest_chat_24442009": "Ohh? Are you afraid, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_24442010": "In fact, I saw something else other than the whole \"skin shedding\" thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_24442011": "Hmm? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24442012": "Just think about it, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_24442013": "These little snakes were working super hard to \"break through\" and make a new life for themselves!",
  "str_quest_chat_24442014": "I feel different after looking at them.",
  "str_quest_chat_24442015": "I feel like I need to continue working hard to grow too!",
  "str_quest_chat_24442016": "So that's what you got from observing them.",
  "str_quest_chat_24442017": "Yup!",
  "str_quest_chat_24442018": "But I think I've made good use of my time here on the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_24442019": "Either way, I'll continue learning from these little snakes!",
  "str_quest_chat_24442020": "I didn't know you were putting in so much effort, Fia.",
  "str_quest_chat_24442021": "Excuse me, what do you mean by that?!",
  "str_quest_chat_24443001": "PlayerName, I tried making some pastries today!",
  "str_quest_chat_24443002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_24443003": "How did it go?",
  "str_quest_chat_24443004": "There are so many steps to making a pastry!",
  "str_quest_chat_24443005": "You know how to make pastries?",
  "str_quest_chat_24443006": "Nope. I just tried to make some!",
  "str_quest_chat_24443007": "And I think... making pastries isn't easy at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_24443008": "First off, I need to prepare my list of ingredients and tools for making pastries!",
  "str_quest_chat_24443009": "Things like pastry molds, trays, a whisk, jam, dough, and so much more!",
  "str_quest_chat_24443010": "Then, we mix everything together! It's also important to use just the right amount of strength to knead the dough.",
  "str_quest_chat_24443011": "Even the jam has to be added in stages to ensure that the pastry has different layers of texture.",
  "str_quest_chat_24443012": "Although I prepared thoroughly and studied the recipe carefully...",
  "str_quest_chat_24443013": "While doing it for real, I still missed a few steps.",
  "str_quest_chat_24443014": "Hehe, but luckily, the final pastry's still pretty yummy!",
  "str_quest_chat_24443015": "It seems like congratulations are in order for gaining a new skill.",
  "str_quest_chat_24443016": "Gaining a new skill isn't the point here!",
  "str_quest_chat_24443017": "What is it then?",
  "str_quest_chat_24443018": "Hmm... How should I put it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24443019": "There are many Aurorians on the Colossus working towards different goals, so I thought...",
  "str_quest_chat_24443020": "Being surrounded by such people really gets you motivated!",
  "str_quest_chat_24443021": "I'm now brimming with confidence to try new things!",
  "str_quest_chat_24443022": "That sounds great, Fia.",
  "str_quest_chat_24443023": "Hehe, of course! I've always been great.",
  "str_quest_chat_24451001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_24451002": "Morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_24451003": "You're up early.",
  "str_quest_chat_24451004": "Hmmph, because Kyllo ate my breakfast!",
  "str_quest_chat_24451005": "I was just on my way to get another one!",
  "str_quest_chat_24451006": "Yeah, everyone should have a good first meal.",
  "str_quest_chat_24451007": "Exactly!",
  "str_quest_chat_24451008": "I'll get going then. See ya!",
  "str_quest_chat_24451009": "Bye, Fia.",
  "str_quest_chat_24452001": "Top of the morning, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_24452002": "There are birds flying around outside the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_24452003": "And there are so many little creatures running around in the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_24452004": "I think the Fireflies are really cute, too! Kyllo was playing with them for a long time!",
  "str_quest_chat_24452005": "Morning, Fia.",
  "str_quest_chat_24452006": "You seem really excited.",
  "str_quest_chat_24452007": "Hehe, morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_24452008": "Whoa! Another little Firefly just flew by!",
  "str_quest_chat_24452009": "Catch you later. I'm going to go play first!",
  "str_quest_chat_24453001": "PlayerName! I went out for a walk this morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_24453002": "I was still sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_24453003": "Ohh dear, PlayerName's lazy, huh.",
  "str_quest_chat_24453004": "Well, I'm up now.",
  "str_quest_chat_24453005": "Whoa, since when does PlayerName wake up so early?",
  "str_quest_chat_24453006": "Ahem...",
  "str_quest_chat_24453007": "Did you come across anything interesting?",
  "str_quest_chat_24453008": "Uh-huh! I found a fragrant plant and brought it to my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_24453009": "I feel great today!",
  "str_quest_chat_24453010": "I hope you feel great today too, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24453011": "Haha, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_24454001": "I also went on a \"Colossus Exploration\" this morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_24454002": "Did it tire you out?",
  "str_quest_chat_24454003": "I'm not tired at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_24454004": "So did you manage to explore a lot?",
  "str_quest_chat_24454005": "Uh-huh!",
  "str_quest_chat_24454006": "I found cobwebs in some corners of the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_24454007": "Does PlayerName know that some spiders are actually good to have around?",
  "str_quest_chat_24454008": "Yes, I know.",
  "str_quest_chat_24454009": "But, since we're on the subject of spiders and insects...",
  "str_quest_chat_24454010": "I think you'll find many like-minded friends on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_24454011": "Really? Looks like I've got my work cut out for me today then!",
  "str_quest_chat_24461001": "Afternoon—",
  "str_quest_chat_24461002": "Afternoon, Fia.",
  "str_quest_chat_24461003": "I did loads of things this morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_24461004": "So I need to drink loads of water and load up on sugar in the afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_24461005": "Shouldn't you consume less sugar?",
  "str_quest_chat_24461006": "Hmm, what's that? Sorry, I don't think I heard you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24462001": "It's the afternoon again~",
  "str_quest_chat_24462002": "And I'm strolling about the Bridge~",
  "str_quest_chat_24462003": "Are you getting ready to sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_24462004": "Are you getting ready to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_24462005": "Nope!",
  "str_quest_chat_24462006": "I'm just enjoying soaking up the sun's rays here.",
  "str_quest_chat_24462007": "The scent of nature restores my energy!",
  "str_quest_chat_24462008": "You have a point.",
  "str_quest_chat_24462009": "You should try it next time, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_24462010": "Very well.",
  "str_quest_chat_24463001": "Why are there so many different shapes of petals?",
  "str_quest_chat_24463002": "Why are the leaves jagged?",
  "str_quest_chat_24463003": "Why does dew taste so good?",
  "str_quest_chat_24463004": "Gosh, there are just so many things to discover and learn!",
  "str_quest_chat_24463005": "Ahh, forget it. Let's get some sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_24463006": "And here I was just about to commend you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24463007": "Everyone should take sufficient breaks while studying!",
  "str_quest_chat_24463008": "See you next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_24463009": "Right, see you next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24481001": "It's late—*yawn*.",
  "str_quest_chat_24481002": "Children should go to bed early.",
  "str_quest_chat_24481003": "I'm not a child!",
  "str_quest_chat_24481004": "But aren't you already sleepy?",
  "str_quest_chat_24481005": "I went to a lot of places during the day, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_24481006": "Alright, alright.",
  "str_quest_chat_24481007": "Then you should go to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_24481008": "Goodnight, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24481009": "Goodnight, Fia.",
  "str_quest_chat_24501001": "Lately, I've been feeling strange on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_24501002": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24501003": "Do you feel unwell?",
  "str_quest_chat_24501004": "I can't tell where this feeling is coming from...",
  "str_quest_chat_24501005": "Because I'm not exactly in the best of shape.",
  "str_quest_chat_24501006": "As to my specific symptoms... Dizziness, palpitations, and the occasional stutter.",
  "str_quest_chat_24501007": "It feels very much like when I set sail for the first time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24501008": "Queasy anticipation, weirdly excited...",
  "str_quest_chat_24501009": "Even right now talking to you, I can feel it building up in me again.",
  "str_quest_chat_24501010": "Err, could it be...",
  "str_quest_chat_24501011": "You're having the same feelings for Soroz as you did for the Emerald?!",
  "str_quest_chat_24501012": "So you're saying... It's a special kind of attraction, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_24501013": "Well, I'm not really sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_24501014": "Since this possibility can't be ruled out...",
  "str_quest_chat_24501015": "I need to know more about your Soroz, or you, for that matter.",
  "str_quest_chat_24501016": "An amazing attraction...",
  "str_quest_chat_24501017": "PlayerName, I just got more interested in staying here.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502001": "I appreciate your recent attempts to help.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502002": "The magic books you placed in the cafe really helped me.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502003": "And because I needed a quiet environment to practice, you also provided me remote rooms.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502004": "You also asked the Fireflies to help me out with many things...",
  "str_quest_chat_24502005": "So, a question arose in my mind recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502006": "Are you this nice to everyone?",
  "str_quest_chat_24502007": "Do you care that much for everyone on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_24502008": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502009": "Everyone on the Colossus is my friend, and I hope everyone can live happily here.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502010": "It's not that.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502011": "I do what I do because I want you to be happy on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502012": "But I don't do this for everyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_24502013": "After all, some people's requirements are a little hard to meet, haha.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502014": "For example, there were many who wanted to take Soroz apart to study it before this...",
  "str_quest_chat_24502015": "But I'm never going to say yes to that!",
  "str_quest_chat_24502016": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_24502017": "Understood.",
  "str_quest_chat_24502018": "You've been a very good companion to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_24502019": "From this day forward, I'll reassess your place in my heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_24541001": "Nice to meet you... The owner of Soroz—PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24541002": "Nice to meet you too, Jeno.",
  "str_quest_chat_24541003": "Do you know what's the most fascinating thing about magic?",
  "str_quest_chat_24541004": "Err, the mystery of it all?",
  "str_quest_chat_24541005": "Err, the magician's extraordinary skills?",
  "str_quest_chat_24541006": "You're right, but it still isn't the \"most\" part of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24541007": "Why do you think people like watching magic shows?",
  "str_quest_chat_24541008": "It's because, rather than the amazing performance itself, they're attracted to what's behind the performance.",
  "str_quest_chat_24541009": "There's a strong desire to \"unveil the magic\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_24541010": "And that is what drives magicians to constantly improve their techniques.",
  "str_quest_chat_24541011": "When you put it that way, I guess it's true...",
  "str_quest_chat_24541012": "It is.",
  "str_quest_chat_24541013": "So, I'd like to discuss this with you in more detail when the chance arises.",
  "str_quest_chat_24541014": "May miracles be with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24542001": "I developed a new diet plan recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_24542002": "Ohh? I wasn't aware you were good at this.",
  "str_quest_chat_24542003": "Strictly speaking, I'm not very good at cooking.",
  "str_quest_chat_24542004": "Huh, so about this diet plan of yours...?",
  "str_quest_chat_24542005": "I need to stay strictly in shape for my performances.",
  "str_quest_chat_24542006": "Because if any part of my body changes in size, I'd need to remake almost all my props.",
  "str_quest_chat_24542007": "So, after my recent visit to the Colossus, I developed a diet plan to help me maintain my weight.",
  "str_quest_chat_24542008": "After following it for a while...",
  "str_quest_chat_24542009": "Not only was I able to maintain my physique, I was even more flexible while performing.",
  "str_quest_chat_24542010": "That's great! Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat_24542011": "Yes, so I thought I needed to thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24542012": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_24542013": "What has your progress got to do with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_24542014": "I wouldn't have been able to complete this diet plan by myself without the Fireflies' help.",
  "str_quest_chat_24542015": "In other words, this progress wouldn't have been possible if I hadn't come to the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_24542016": "Well... I don't think it's necessary to thank me, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_24542017": "Uhh, you're welcome?",
  "str_quest_chat_24542018": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_24543001": "Dear PlayerName, I have a request.",
  "str_quest_chat_24543002": "What request?",
  "str_quest_chat_24543003": "Alright, I think we can do without the word \"request.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_24543004": "There's no need to be so formal...",
  "str_quest_chat_24543005": "I'm more than willing to help everyone on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_24543006": "If possible, I'd like to...",
  "str_quest_chat_24543007": "Invite you to join me up on stage for a magic act.",
  "str_quest_chat_24543008": "I'd love to say yes, but I don't know a thing about magic.",
  "str_quest_chat_24543009": "Would I be able to perform on stage with you without knowing anything?",
  "str_quest_chat_24543010": "Yes, you can.",
  "str_quest_chat_24543011": "Your keen perception of Lumina will be of great help to me in manipulating the Origin Deck...",
  "str_quest_chat_24543012": "With your help, I believe my performance will be more precise and controlled.",
  "str_quest_chat_24543013": "Ahh, I see!",
  "str_quest_chat_24543014": "Yes. From the past few battles, I saw a noticeable improvement while working with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24543015": "Now that I've gotten your consent, I'll first try to come up with a personalized stage for us.",
  "str_quest_chat_24543016": "Excellent!",
  "str_quest_chat_24551001": "It's time to stop dreaming now.",
  "str_quest_chat_24551002": "Umm, I'm already up.",
  "str_quest_chat_24551003": "I'll be working on some new tricks today.",
  "str_quest_chat_24551004": "You have a good day, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24551005": "Ahh, sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_24551006": "Goodbye then.",
  "str_quest_chat_24551007": "Yes, bye then, Jeno.",
  "str_quest_chat_24561001": "Good afternoon, I should get ready for my performance.",
  "str_quest_chat_24561002": "Sounds like another busy day.",
  "str_quest_chat_24561003": "Well, I'm used to being so busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_24561004": "Have you eaten?",
  "str_quest_chat_24561005": "Yeah, a little.",
  "str_quest_chat_24561006": "Good to know.",
  "str_quest_chat_24561007": "Looks like I'll have to do my best today as well!",
  "str_quest_chat_24561008": "Yes, let's give it our best.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562002": "There's something I've been finding a little difficult to tell you, but I have to say it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562003": "Hmm? It's alright, you can tell me anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562004": "I won't be dining in your Colossus for a period after this.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562005": "Why's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_24562006": "I've put on some weight recently because the food here's just too delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562007": "You mean the lunch boxes at the restaurant?",
  "str_quest_chat_24562008": "That's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562009": "Are they really that delicious?",
  "str_quest_chat_24562010": "What kind of food do you usually eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_24562011": "Well, some don't taste particularly good, but they're really nutritious.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562012": "I see. I guess you're talking about non-greasy foods, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_24562013": "Yes, but you can rest assured.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562014": "When I reach my desired weight, I'll be back here to eat again.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562015": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_24562016": "You don't cut yourself much slack, huh...",
  "str_quest_chat_24581001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24581002": "There's something special about the Colossus at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_24581003": "Does it remind you of your sailing days?",
  "str_quest_chat_24581004": "Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_24581005": "The rise and fall of the Colossus in the air reminds me of the Emerald riding the ocean's waves.",
  "str_quest_chat_24581006": "It's the perfect rhythm to rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_24581007": "Really... I hadn't noticed that.",
  "str_quest_chat_24581008": "Please, rest early.",
  "str_quest_chat_24581009": "Alright, you too, Jeno.",
  "str_quest_chat_24582001": "Sorry to bother.",
  "str_quest_chat_24582002": "I'm already sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_24582003": "That's not a very funny joke.",
  "str_quest_chat_24582004": "Don't worry, you're not bothering me at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_24582005": "Well, I didn't expect such a reply.",
  "str_quest_chat_24582006": "Haha, what's up Jeno?",
  "str_quest_chat_24582007": "I can't fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_24582008": "Sleepless nights always make me feel like I'm sleeping on land, not at sea.",
  "str_quest_chat_24582009": "You really like the sea, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_24582010": "Love.",
  "str_quest_chat_24582011": "Well, how about imagining the sounds of the sea?",
  "str_quest_chat_24582012": "It could help you fall asleep faster.",
  "str_quest_chat_24582013": "I'll give that a go. Goodnight then.",
  "str_quest_chat_24582014": "Alright, goodnight then.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583001": "The late night wind smells different compared to in the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583002": "Are you still at the Bridge?",
  "str_quest_chat_24583003": "Shouldn't you be sleeping already?",
  "str_quest_chat_24583004": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583005": "But the wind carries with it so many stories and experiences.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583006": "Well, when you put it that way, I guess so.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583007": "Just feeling it is enough to inspire some new magic ideas.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583008": "You're really... How should I put it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24583009": "\"Follow your heart\"? Yeah, I think that's it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583010": "I'll take that as a compliment.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583011": "Well, I do mean it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583012": "Thank you. You should rest early.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583013": "Alright, goodnight then.",
  "str_quest_chat_24583014": "Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_24584001": "I won't be resting tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_24584002": "Why not?",
  "str_quest_chat_24584003": "Is there something you need to finish by today?",
  "str_quest_chat_24584004": "Are you in a bad mood?",
  "str_quest_chat_24584005": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_24584006": "It's because it's raining outside.",
  "str_quest_chat_24584007": "And I need to fully appreciate a rainy night such as this.",
  "str_quest_chat_24584008": "Right... It does seem like something you'd do.",
  "str_quest_chat_24584009": "Well, goodnight then. I wish you a pleasant night in the company of the rain.",
  "str_quest_chat_24584010": "Right, goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_24585001": "What do you usually think about at this time?",
  "str_quest_chat_24585002": "Nothing much really...",
  "str_quest_chat_24585003": "I'm a little sleepy already, but I'm trying to decide whether to go to bed right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_24585004": "Ohh, just a little bit of everything.",
  "str_quest_chat_24585005": "What to do tomorrow, what to eat, what the future holds...",
  "str_quest_chat_24585006": "Things like that?",
  "str_quest_chat_24585007": "My thoughts exactly.",
  "str_quest_chat_24585008": "But I've decided to turn in, and I'm sure you have too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24585009": "Mmm, *yawns*... Since you mentioned it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24585010": "Goodnight, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24585011": "Night, Jeno.",
  "str_quest_chat_24601001": "PlayerName, do you want to watch a free show?",
  "str_quest_chat_24601002": "Really? That can't be true!",
  "str_quest_chat_24601003": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_24601004": "But before that... can you do me a favor?",
  "str_quest_chat_24601005": "Let's talk in person. I'll be waiting for you at the Bridge!",
  "str_quest_chat_24601999": "What does Rainbow want you to help her with? Ask her at the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_24602001": "Hi, PlayerName, I've been collecting lots of trinkets lately!",
  "str_quest_chat_24602002": "Ohh? I didn't know you had such a hobby.",
  "str_quest_chat_24602003": "Well, when you say that...",
  "str_quest_chat_24602004": "I don't think I ever had such a hobby!",
  "str_quest_chat_24602005": "I wouldn't say it's a hobby of mine. It's just something I've been doing recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_24602006": "Alright, so what have you been collecting these days?",
  "str_quest_chat_24602007": "A cup, a cute little spoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_24602008": "Ahh, isn't that pretty similar to what you have, PlayerName?!",
  "str_quest_chat_24602009": "Ohh, and there's a book as well!",
  "str_quest_chat_24602010": "When I went to the cafe to read, they said you read this book, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24602011": "Hey, I just realized something...",
  "str_quest_chat_24602012": "Why do I keep collecting stuff related to PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_24602013": "That thought just crossed my mind too...",
  "str_quest_chat_24602014": "Haha, it's exactly the same as when I first got hooked on mechanical repairs!",
  "str_quest_chat_24602015": "I was probably just too curious about the identity of PlayerName—the Colossus' owner.",
  "str_quest_chat_24602016": "Exactly what kind of person is able to connect with Soroz? What do they usually do?",
  "str_quest_chat_24602017": "And so with those thoughts, I just...",
  "str_quest_chat_24602018": "Now I know what caused all this!",
  "str_quest_chat_24602019": "You can just ask me anything you're curious about next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24602020": "Hehe, alright!",
  "str_quest_chat_24602021": "PlayerName is the best!",
  "str_quest_chat_24603001": "PlayerName, can you dive?",
  "str_quest_chat_24603002": "Nope, not at all...",
  "str_quest_chat_24603003": "Ooh?",
  "str_quest_chat_24603004": "Then, if the chance comes up, I'll be more than happy to teach you!",
  "str_quest_chat_24603005": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_24603006": "Sort of, I guess?",
  "str_quest_chat_24603007": "I wasn't expecting that!",
  "str_quest_chat_24603008": "Why the sudden question?",
  "str_quest_chat_24603009": "Because today I broke my own record for holding my breath underwater!",
  "str_quest_chat_24603010": "Wasn't your previous record pretty impressive already?",
  "str_quest_chat_24603011": "Yup. I thought it was going to be hard for me to beat that.",
  "str_quest_chat_24603012": "But I don't know why, while holding my breath today, I suddenly thought of PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_24603013": "At that time, I suddenly thought of PlayerName's funny figure on the surfboard, and then...",
  "str_quest_chat_24603014": "Then I almost choked!",
  "str_quest_chat_24603015": "But I tried so hard not to!",
  "str_quest_chat_24603016": "I did my best to think about how even PlayerName, who's not good in the water, can surf bravely.",
  "str_quest_chat_24603017": "So why can't I, who love the water so much, do better?",
  "str_quest_chat_24603018": "Just like that, while thinking about PlayerName's funny figure, I broke my own record!",
  "str_quest_chat_24603019": "Then again, I don't know if I should be happy or sad...",
  "str_quest_chat_24603020": "Still... I'd like to congratulate you, Rainbow...",
  "str_quest_chat_24603021": "Ahahaha... Thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641001": "Recently, whenever I appear on stage, the audience goes wild!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641002": "Aren't your performances always a hit?",
  "str_quest_chat_24641003": "But there were lots of new faces this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24641004": "And they told me they came specifically to watch my performance!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641005": "Well, that's great news, Rainbow!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641006": "Looks like you've become even more popular!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641007": "Ohh, I wouldn't say that! Everyone's just too kind.",
  "str_quest_chat_24641008": "Did you get better?",
  "str_quest_chat_24641009": "Hmm... Did I?",
  "str_quest_chat_24641010": "Now that I think back...",
  "str_quest_chat_24641011": "I guess I really did!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641012": "Everyone applauds loudly at each opening performance nowadays!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641013": "And whenever it reaches halftime, things get even more lively!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641014": "Well, it must be because of the many new friends I've made through PlayerName recently!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641015": "And because I've made lots of different friends, I now know how to handle the audience better!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641016": "Through me? I don't think so.",
  "str_quest_chat_24641017": "I think it's because everyone's attracted to your cheerful personality.",
  "str_quest_chat_24641018": "Even then, I only got to know everyone after knowing PlayerName first!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641019": "Anyway, I'll continue to observe and \"learn\" more on the Colossus after this! Hahaha!",
  "str_quest_chat_24641020": "Sure, sounds great!",
  "str_quest_chat_24651001": "Why hello, my audience!",
  "str_quest_chat_24651002": "Morning, Rainbow.",
  "str_quest_chat_24651003": "Oh my, I wasn't expecting you to be up already!",
  "str_quest_chat_24651004": "Did I somehow give you the impression I'm always in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_24651005": "Nope, but there are rumors!",
  "str_quest_chat_24651006": "*coughs* Darn it! It really wasn't Vice who told me!",
  "str_quest_chat_24651007": "Bye then. Have a great day ahead!",
  "str_quest_chat_24651008": "... Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_24652001": "Morning! Wouldn't you agree now's the best time to catch fish?",
  "str_quest_chat_24652002": "Had your breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_24652003": "Yeap, I have!",
  "str_quest_chat_24652004": "And I just woke up...",
  "str_quest_chat_24652005": "Hehe, I knew it!",
  "str_quest_chat_24652006": "But waking up at this time is still good enough.",
  "str_quest_chat_24652007": "I caught a fish and your Fireflies are cleaning it up in the kitchen now.",
  "str_quest_chat_24652008": "Ahh, thanks a ton, Rainbow.",
  "str_quest_chat_24652009": "You're most welcome!",
  "str_quest_chat_24661001": "Greetings from Rainbow 63! Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_24661002": "Why is it Rainbow 63?",
  "str_quest_chat_24661003": "I'm numbering all I'm doing today!",
  "str_quest_chat_24661004": "You've done this much in just such a short time?!",
  "str_quest_chat_24661005": "Greetings from Rainbow 68.",
  "str_quest_chat_24661006": "And you did five more things in just a few seconds?!",
  "str_quest_chat_24661007": "Hehe, I just wiped the table, arranged some things, and so on. Nothing fancy!",
  "str_quest_chat_24661008": "Hello from Rainbow 70! PlayerName, why don't you take an early lunch break?",
  "str_quest_chat_24661009": "... I was just thinking about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24662001": "Just taking the chance to say hello again in between the Colossus performance rehearsal!",
  "str_quest_chat_24662002": "Good afternoon, Rainbow.",
  "str_quest_chat_24662003": "Busy day?",
  "str_quest_chat_24662004": "Super—!",
  "str_quest_chat_24662005": "Ahhhhh, it's Merylt and the girls' turn to go on stage. I need to go introduce them!",
  "str_quest_chat_24662006": "You sure are busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_24663001": "Hey, PlayerName! I had a super delicious ramen today!",
  "str_quest_chat_24663002": "From where?",
  "str_quest_chat_24663003": "On the Colossus, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_24663004": "How nice was it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24663005": "I finished two bowls in just one sitting!",
  "str_quest_chat_24663006": "Hearing you talk about it makes me crave for one myself too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24663007": "Uh-huh! I highly recommend it for your lunch today!",
  "str_quest_chat_24663008": "Got it!",
  "str_quest_chat_24701001": "From my observations... there are a lot of books on your Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701002": "You must be a child who loves learning.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701003": "Heheh, you could say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701004": "I give most of the credit to the good friends I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701005": "They'd often recommend different books to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701006": "So the books piled up over time, some even have several copies.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701007": "Several copies?",
  "str_quest_chat_24701008": "Oh... Yeah!",
  "str_quest_chat_24701009": "If you don't mind, Pollux...",
  "str_quest_chat_24701010": "You can give them to the kids in church!",
  "str_quest_chat_24701011": "I'm very pleased to hear that.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701012": "But we currently don't have anyone to teach them literacy.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701013": "That's a problem.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701014": "Actually, the kids have been wanting to see you again.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701015": "Would you mind teaching them to read, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_24701016": "Me?",
  "str_quest_chat_24701017": "Of course, instructor PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24701018": "Then I shall get a book on how to be a teacher...",
  "str_quest_chat_24701019": "You will?",
  "str_quest_chat_24701020": "I knew I was right about you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702001": "Any plans for the day?",
  "str_quest_chat_24702002": "Follow the Illumina training plan in the morning for fitness.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702003": "Read the books recommended by the Queen of the North in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702004": "Learn etiquette from a Lumopolis instructor in the evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702005": "You got no free time for the day at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702006": "So, are you seeing me for something?",
  "str_quest_chat_24702007": "Nothing important.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702008": "I'm off today and don't have to mind the church kids.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702009": "So I thought I could go outfit shopping with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702010": "I'd like to, but I'm afraid I'm no help to you in that area.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702011": "Who said I needed your help?",
  "str_quest_chat_24702012": "I want to buy you something more presentable.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702013": "For me? But that might cost a lot...",
  "str_quest_chat_24702014": "A shame you're not available. Maybe next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24702015": "Okay... I feel like I just missed out on something big.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703001": "I hear you mention Vice and Carleen quite a lot, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703002": "Are they friends of yours?",
  "str_quest_chat_24703003": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_24703004": "They're my pals and close allies on the battlefield.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703005": "No...",
  "str_quest_chat_24703006": "Our bond goes beyond just friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703007": "I guess you could call us comrades-in-arms.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703008": "That's very enviable.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703009": "Do you trust them unconditionally?",
  "str_quest_chat_24703010": "Of course. That's always been the case for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703011": "So, do they trust you unconditionally as well?",
  "str_quest_chat_24703012": "I'm not sure exactly what they think, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_24703013": "I hope I become someone they trust.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703014": "Aren't you afraid they would get hurt from your mistakes?",
  "str_quest_chat_24703015": "I do, but that's precisely the reason...",
  "str_quest_chat_24703016": "That's why I would weigh everything carefully before making a decision.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703017": "You would? Hmm, you are wiser than I imagined.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703018": "If possible, Pollux...",
  "str_quest_chat_24703019": "I hope I can be someone you can trust, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24703020": "You already are.",
  "str_quest_chat_24704001": "I heard you love to go shopping in Umbraton, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_24704002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_24704003": "I can get many supplies for the Colossus in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_24704004": "So I shop there a lot.",
  "str_quest_chat_24704005": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_24704006": "But in order to restock the Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_24704007": "I have to shop there from time to time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24704008": "Yup, I picked the right person.",
  "str_quest_chat_24704009": "Come on, let's hit Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_24704010": "I'll wait for you on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_24704999": "Why does Pollux want to go with you to Umbraton? Ask her at the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741001": "Hello, this is Pollux.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741002": "Thank you for inviting me aboard the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741003": "If you need anything done, let me know.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741004": "The cost is negotiable.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741005": "Oh, and another thing...",
  "str_quest_chat_24741006": "You'll have to pay me the traveling expenses for any tasks outside of Euphoria.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741007": "But if you use the Colossus as a shuttle, that could be waived.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741008": "I usually let Nekoyashiki do the introduction.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741009": "So pardon me if I missed anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741010": "It's thorough enough... Although I probably won't be bothering you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741011": "I take side hustles sometimes to supplement income, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741012": "We're in the same business, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741013": "Well, it takes a lot of money to keep the Colossus running.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741014": "You often get a lot of job requests, right? Don't you get tired?",
  "str_quest_chat_24741015": "For the kids in the church...",
  "str_quest_chat_24741016": "I'll never be tired.",
  "str_quest_chat_24741017": "Amazing!",
  "str_quest_chat_24742001": "Is it just me or...",
  "str_quest_chat_24742002": "Have I been working better with my gun lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_24742003": "Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat_24742004": "Your marksmanship must have improved!",
  "str_quest_chat_24742005": "Not sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_24742006": "I've always thought you're a deadeye shooter.",
  "str_quest_chat_24742007": "It's probably too subtle to feel for people other than myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_24742008": "I'm curious, can you describe the feeling?",
  "str_quest_chat_24742009": "It's as if I've become one with the gun.",
  "str_quest_chat_24742010": "This does feel vaguely familiar, actually...",
  "str_quest_chat_24742011": "It reminds me of the time when I fought with a blade.",
  "str_quest_chat_24742012": "In a dark, damp training room, bewitched by false promises...",
  "str_quest_chat_24742013": "Stabbing at imaginary foes again and again.",
  "str_quest_chat_24742014": "It took countless days of hard work for me to become one with my blade.",
  "str_quest_chat_24742015": "I thought I'd never relive it after I hung my blade up.",
  "str_quest_chat_24742016": "Thank you, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_24742017": "What for?",
  "str_quest_chat_24742018": "Thank you for witnessing the moment.",
  "str_quest_chat_24742019": "I shall use the gun in my hand...",
  "str_quest_chat_24742020": "To protect those I want to protect.",
  "str_quest_chat_24751001": "Get up, the sun's out.",
  "str_quest_chat_24751002": "I'm already awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_24751003": "That's a nice routine you keep.",
  "str_quest_chat_24751004": "I don't have to worry about you as I do with all the other kids.",
  "str_quest_chat_24751005": "Let me sleep in a bit...",
  "str_quest_chat_24751006": "I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24751007": "I have to worry about you as I do with all the other kids.",
  "str_quest_chat_24751008": "You don't think I'm still a kid, do you, Pollux?",
  "str_quest_chat_24751009": "What do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_24752001": "You seem to be in a good mood today.",
  "str_quest_chat_24752002": "What makes you say that?",
  "str_quest_chat_24752003": "You had a big breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_24752004": "You must be feeling good to have such a big appetite.",
  "str_quest_chat_24752005": "Tell me, what happened today?",
  "str_quest_chat_24752006": "Nothing special, actually.",
  "str_quest_chat_24752007": "It was one of those rare occasions when they served all my favorites for breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_24752008": "Only eating what you like? That's not a good habit to get into.",
  "str_quest_chat_24752009": "I'll try to change that...",
  "str_quest_chat_24752010": "Why don't you go back with me to Euphoria and stay there for a few days?",
  "str_quest_chat_24752011": "Then you'll appreciate how hard it is for each meal to come by.",
  "str_quest_chat_24752012": "I'll, uh, think about it...",
  "str_quest_chat_24761001": "Are you always so energetic all day long?",
  "str_quest_chat_24761002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_24761003": "Because I'd like to seize every minute to do what I want to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_24761004": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_24761005": "It's just I'm in a better situation lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_24761006": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_24761007": "But I think you're the one who's energetic, Pollux, and I want to learn from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24761008": "You do?",
  "str_quest_chat_24761009": "Energy comes naturally when one learns to own their responsibilities.",
  "str_quest_chat_24761010": "I thought that was the case for you, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24761011": "I shall strive for that!",
  "str_quest_chat_24762001": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_24762002": "Your mind seems to wander today.",
  "str_quest_chat_24762003": "Oh, nothing's wrong...",
  "str_quest_chat_24762004": "Do you think you could fool me?",
  "str_quest_chat_24762005": "Tell me, maybe I can help.",
  "str_quest_chat_24762006": "It's a minor issue, really... No one cooked on the Colossus today.",
  "str_quest_chat_24762007": "To be honest, that's not my strong suit, so I'll have to try my best.",
  "str_quest_chat_24762008": "I hope no one will spurn the Colossus because I make bad food.",
  "str_quest_chat_24762009": "And here I thought it might be something catastrophic.",
  "str_quest_chat_24762010": "Check the kitchen out. I made something for everyone.",
  "str_quest_chat_24762011": "I can't guarantee it's good, but nobody's going to starve.",
  "str_quest_chat_24762012": "You can cook?!",
  "str_quest_chat_24762013": "Why is that a surprise?",
  "str_quest_chat_24762014": "Well, anyway, thanks a lot!",
  "str_quest_chat_24781001": "It's getting late. Kids who stay up won't grow any taller.",
  "str_quest_chat_24781002": "Why does everybody keep saying that to me?",
  "str_quest_chat_24781003": "Oh?",
  "str_quest_chat_24781004": "I guess you got a lot of people caring about you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24781005": "Is that why? I feel better now.",
  "str_quest_chat_24781006": "I thought everyone was making fun of me for not being tall enough.",
  "str_quest_chat_24781007": "Well, if you put it like that, they do seem to have a point...",
  "str_quest_chat_24781008": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_24782001": "Good evening, PlayerName, I got a question for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24782002": "For me? That makes me feel a bit pressured...",
  "str_quest_chat_24782003": "What's there to be pressured about?",
  "str_quest_chat_24782004": "I just want to know when the bar on the Colossus closes.",
  "str_quest_chat_24782005": "You're going for a drink this late at night, Pollux?",
  "str_quest_chat_24782006": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_24782007": "I'm just thinking that many kids hang out here.",
  "str_quest_chat_24782008": "But they really should be in bed by this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24782009": "You know what I'm getting at, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_24782010": "Don't tell me someone's playing loud music in the bar again!",
  "str_quest_chat_24782011": "I'll send the Fireflies to shut that down...",
  "str_quest_chat_24783001": "Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_24783002": "Just getting ready to.",
  "str_quest_chat_24783003": "Have you picked out what you're going to wear for tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat_24783004": "Uh, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_24783005": "It's too soon for that.",
  "str_quest_chat_24783006": "Are you picking out what you're going to wear for tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat_24783007": "Uh, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_24783008": "I see. Well, I'm in a quandary...",
  "str_quest_chat_24783009": "... over which outfit to wear tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_24783010": "Are you troubled by that?",
  "str_quest_chat_24783011": "No, no, not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_24783012": "It's no trouble when I actually enjoy the process.",
  "str_quest_chat_24783013": "Maybe I should try to enjoy picking out an outfit, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_24783014": "Unfortunately, your selection doesn't afford you with a lot of choices.",
  "str_quest_chat_24783015": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_24783016": "I suggest letting Nekoyashiki field something nice for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24784001": "Good night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24784002": "Good night, Pollux.",
  "str_quest_chat_24784003": "Are you someone who falls asleep right after saying good night?",
  "str_quest_chat_24784004": "What do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_24784005": "My gut feeling tells me you probably won't until very late.",
  "str_quest_chat_24784006": "Not bad, Caelestite, very intuitive.",
  "str_quest_chat_24784007": "Is that because you're too busy working?",
  "str_quest_chat_24784008": "Sometimes, but just insomnia other times.",
  "str_quest_chat_24784009": "It's nothing, just don't tell the kids in church.",
  "str_quest_chat_24784010": "I don't want any wild speculations out of them.",
  "str_quest_chat_24784011": "I promise you I won't tell.",
  "str_quest_chat_24784012": "But please do talk to me about any trouble you might have.",
  "str_quest_chat_24784013": "Don't you go off speculating. Go to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_24784014": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_24801001": "Don't sleep with your window open when it's chilly outside, or you'll get strep throat.",
  "str_quest_chat_24801002": "Drink more water and watch your daily sugar intake.",
  "str_quest_chat_24801003": "Make sure you're tucked in tight in bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_24801004": "Eat all three meals on time and look after yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_24801005": "Uh... Casta?",
  "str_quest_chat_24801006": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_24801007": "Sorry, I just nagged like you were a child.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802001": "I saved a freezing pigeon yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802002": "It probably flew a long way from somewhere very cold.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802003": "It squirmed a little when I touched it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802004": "Its leg was also bleeding and in pretty bad shape.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802005": "So I kept it in my room for a night.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802006": "It recovered miraculously this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802007": "You're very caring, Casta!",
  "str_quest_chat_24802008": "Generally, I don't meddle.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802009": "I don't think that counts as meddling.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802010": "I just thought if it was you, that's what you would do.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802011": "So I did it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802012": "The decision was all yours, Casta.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802013": "Is it that hard to admit you're kind and caring?",
  "str_quest_chat_24802014": "... Perhaps.",
  "str_quest_chat_24802015": "This is rather awkward.",
  "str_quest_chat_24803001": "You mentioned you want to know more about Euphoria, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24803002": "Now is your chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_24803003": "I have to do something to feed the children for next month.",
  "str_quest_chat_24803004": "Would you come along?",
  "str_quest_chat_24803005": "If you don't mind, that is.",
  "str_quest_chat_24803006": "Sure. I got nothing urgent at the moment.",
  "str_quest_chat_24803007": "I'll wait for you in the Cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_24803008": "But hurry, I'm pressed for time.",
  "str_quest_chat_24803999": "Casta is waiting for you in the Cafe. What will she do to feed the children for the coming month?",
  "str_quest_chat_24841001": "There are a lot of very disciplined Aurorians aboard your Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841003": "Sometimes I feel stressed seeing how disciplined they are.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841004": "You think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_24841005": "I can name three or four off my head, but I wouldn't call it \"a lot.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_24841006": "The point is to stick to it every day, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_24841007": "Hmm... Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841008": "Seeing them motivated me to intensify my marksmanship training.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841009": "Aren't you training every day?",
  "str_quest_chat_24841010": "That's why I said \"intensify.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_24841011": "You're obviously very disciplined.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841012": "No, make that \"even more disciplined.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_24841013": "I just don't like to procrastinate.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841014": "\"One day...\", \"I'll do it when...\", \"I will next time...\"",
  "str_quest_chat_24841015": "Those are just excuses to put things off.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841016": "Reality often changes much quicker than any plan, so...",
  "str_quest_chat_24841017": "We should start doing everything on our to-do lists immediately.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841018": "The progress brought by discipline will make you proud.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841019": "For example, I improved my accuracy recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_24841020": "That's awesome! I got to be motivated like you, Casta!",
  "str_quest_chat_24841021": "Good for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842002": "Yes?",
  "str_quest_chat_24842003": "Have you heard of something called a time capsule?",
  "str_quest_chat_24842004": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842005": "Is that when you write down expectations for your future...",
  "str_quest_chat_24842006": "And wait until the specific time, like ten or twenty years later...",
  "str_quest_chat_24842007": "Then check back to see what you wrote?",
  "str_quest_chat_24842008": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842009": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842010": "I think I kind of know what it is, but still, it's hard to explain.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842011": "Simply put, it's like a review of your life.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842012": "You write down your aspirations when you're a child, then look back on them when you're an adult.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842013": "Different people will probably get different perspectives on how their lives turn out.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842014": "Why do you bring it up, Casta?",
  "str_quest_chat_24842015": "Because I opened my time capsule today.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842016": "And I realized...",
  "str_quest_chat_24842017": "I've become the person I wanted to be.",
  "str_quest_chat_24842018": "I feel satisfied... Maybe this feeling is related to you?",
  "str_quest_chat_24842019": "I'll mull it over.",
  "str_quest_chat_24851001": "Morning. It's nice and warm today.",
  "str_quest_chat_24851002": "Though it's overcast and drizzling.",
  "str_quest_chat_24851003": "You can replenish more energy this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_24851004": "Did you go out already, Casta?",
  "str_quest_chat_24851005": "Yeah, got something to take care of.",
  "str_quest_chat_24851006": "Remember not to skip breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_24851007": "Right! Thanks for the reminder.",
  "str_quest_chat_24851008": "No sweat.",
  "str_quest_chat_24852001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_24852002": "Morning, Casta.",
  "str_quest_chat_24852003": "I just got back from a stroll.",
  "str_quest_chat_24852004": "By yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_24852005": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_24852006": "I think it's a delight to take a morning stroll alone.",
  "str_quest_chat_24852007": "Have you eaten?",
  "str_quest_chat_24852008": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_24852009": "I eat every meal on time to make sure I have the energy to handle any emergency.",
  "str_quest_chat_24852010": "Got it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24852011": "I'm going back to my room. See you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24852012": "Okay, see you later.",
  "str_quest_chat_24853001": "I tried a bite of the loot from yesterday.",
  "str_quest_chat_24853002": "It turned out to be a bunch of spicy chocolate.",
  "str_quest_chat_24853003": "Luckily I didn't hand them out to the kids.",
  "str_quest_chat_24853004": "True, very careful of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24853005": "It's just a safety precaution.",
  "str_quest_chat_24853006": "I got to sell these chocolates to those who want them. See you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24853007": "Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_24854001": "Morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_24854002": "Morning, Casta.",
  "str_quest_chat_24854003": "I won so much money last night that I have no clue how to spend it.",
  "str_quest_chat_24854004": "Really? That's fantastic!",
  "str_quest_chat_24854005": "I was going to ask if you needed a subsidy for the Colossus, but then I thought...",
  "str_quest_chat_24854006": "As a Caelestite, you're probably not hurting for cash.",
  "str_quest_chat_24854007": "So I ought to hand it over to Pollux.",
  "str_quest_chat_24854008": "Wait...",
  "str_quest_chat_24854009": "I...",
  "str_quest_chat_24854010": "The signal's cutting out?",
  "str_quest_chat_24854011": "I got to run then. See you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24854012": "Bye...",
  "str_quest_chat_24861001": "The noon sun is too bright.",
  "str_quest_chat_24861002": "Did you just wake up?",
  "str_quest_chat_24861003": "You don't like it?",
  "str_quest_chat_24861004": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_24861005": "I'm just not used to such lovely weather.",
  "str_quest_chat_24861006": "Though I'll get used to it in time. Maybe.",
  "str_quest_chat_24861007": "Yeah, I hope so.",
  "str_quest_chat_24861008": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_24861009": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901001": "I'm Judge Jr. the esteemed. It is your honor to know me.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901002": "I can imagine you must be both nervous and shy at the moment.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901003": "Of course, I can also understand your fascination with the Troys.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901004": "I see not even a Caelestite could resist my charm.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901005": "...?",
  "str_quest_chat_24901006": "Ahem, back to the topic.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901007": "I heard you wished to visit my office?",
  "str_quest_chat_24901008": "Uh, actually, I mentioned it in passing to Irridon.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901009": "I'd like to know what people do in the Hall of Justice.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901010": "So she told me to contact you.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901011": "She said... uh, you're the one with the most spare time in the Hall.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901012": "What? Why didn't you mention it was her sooner?",
  "str_quest_chat_24901013": "I'll wait for you at the Bridge!",
  "str_quest_chat_24901014": "I'll take you to the office and make sure Lady Irridon is pleased!",
  "str_quest_chat_24901015": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_24901999": "Judge Jr. is waiting at the Bridge to take you to his office. Go there now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25001001": "Still working, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25001002": "Yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat_25001003": "Doing exercises.",
  "str_quest_chat_25001004": "You make time for exercising, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25001005": "Actually, I'd like to get stronger too.",
  "str_quest_chat_25001006": "An outstanding actor needs a great physical presence.",
  "str_quest_chat_25001007": "Studying hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_25001008": "I didn't know you liked reading so much, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25001009": "I'd like to be more educated too.",
  "str_quest_chat_25001010": "An outstanding actor needs to be very cultured.",
  "str_quest_chat_25001011": "Hey. That means you'd be a good actor, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_25001012": "M-Me?",
  "str_quest_chat_25001013": "And you've already got a good fanbase. They'd be bound to come and see your movies.",
  "str_quest_chat_25001014": "Heehee. How do you feel about being the leading man?",
  "str_quest_chat_25001015": "I'll give it some thought...",
  "str_quest_chat_25001016": "Okay. But don't miss your chance!",
  "str_quest_chat_25002001": "PlayerName, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_25002002": "I need your help! Urgently!",
  "str_quest_chat_25002003": "What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_25002004": "I found a bunch of flowers by my door when I returned home...",
  "str_quest_chat_25002005": "They must be a gift from my fans!",
  "str_quest_chat_25002006": "They didn't leave a name, but if possible...",
  "str_quest_chat_25002007": "Could you help me identify them?",
  "str_quest_chat_25002008": "I'd like to give them a signed photograph as a thankyou.",
  "str_quest_chat_25002009": "I don't think I can help you, sorry.",
  "str_quest_chat_25002010": "If they didn't leave a name, it means they don't want to be contacted.",
  "str_quest_chat_25002011": "Perhaps you can repay them by working even harder.",
  "str_quest_chat_25002012": "That makes sense...",
  "str_quest_chat_25002013": "I know who left them.",
  "str_quest_chat_25002014": "But I can't tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25002015": "This seems suspicious. Are you sure it wasn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25002016": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_25002017": "Is it so hard to admit you're a fan?",
  "str_quest_chat_25002018": "I'll tell you a secret. I'm actually a member of the Lovegators.",
  "str_quest_chat_25002019": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_25003001": "What am I going to do, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25003002": "I think I'm getting wrinkles under my eyes!",
  "str_quest_chat_25003003": "Have you been tired lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_25003004": "No. I rested for a few days to see if that helped but it didn't!",
  "str_quest_chat_25003005": "Is this the end of my acting career?",
  "str_quest_chat_25003006": "Why would you say that? You're still young!",
  "str_quest_chat_25003007": "You don't understand, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_25003008": "Alleywood is very demanding of its actors.",
  "str_quest_chat_25003009": "A wrinkle gained is a role lost, they say.",
  "str_quest_chat_25003010": "It's not that bad, is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_25003011": "I think wrinkles show you have accumulated life experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_25003012": "And make you look wise.",
  "str_quest_chat_25003013": "If anything, it means that you can take on more challenging roles.",
  "str_quest_chat_25003014": "Wow. You might have a point!",
  "str_quest_chat_25003015": "Although I'm not entirely sure you are right.",
  "str_quest_chat_25003999": "Lilica is looking for you on the Bridge. Go meet up with her!",
  "str_quest_chat_25004001": "PlayerName, are there any movies you'd like to watch?",
  "str_quest_chat_25004002": "Why are you asking that?",
  "str_quest_chat_25004003": "I'm doing a survey to see what kind of movies everyone likes...",
  "str_quest_chat_25004004": "I'm hoping it'll give me inspiration for a new movie I can make!",
  "str_quest_chat_25004005": "Why don't you make the movie that you want to watch, Lilica?",
  "str_quest_chat_25004006": "Oh, but I like all movies, whatever the genre.",
  "str_quest_chat_25004007": "And that makes it hard to decide what to make.",
  "str_quest_chat_25004008": "And if I don't make movies, I don't make money. And if I don't make money, I can't save any.",
  "str_quest_chat_25004009": "What if I can't go home to see my parents again this year?",
  "str_quest_chat_25004010": "Your family lives near Umbraton, don't they?",
  "str_quest_chat_25004011": "Why don't I take you home on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_25004012": "And maybe a visit home will help you find inspiration.",
  "str_quest_chat_25004013": "But PlayerName, I can't afford to pay you anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_25004014": "Don't worry about that. Think of it as sponsorship for your new film.",
  "str_quest_chat_25004015": "Am I dreaming!? I really am so lucky!",
  "str_quest_chat_25004016": "I'll come to the Bridge immediately. Don't go anywhere!",
  "str_quest_chat_25004017": "N-Now?",
  "str_quest_chat_25041001": "PlayerName, thanks for letting me film on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_25041002": "You're so generous!",
  "str_quest_chat_25041003": "I won't let everyone down, I promise. My movie about the Colossus will be awesome!",
  "str_quest_chat_25041004": "About the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_25041005": "How come I didn't know about this?",
  "str_quest_chat_25041006": "Oh. Don't tell me I forgot to mention it...",
  "str_quest_chat_25041007": "Never mind, though. You know now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25041008": "So tell me about this movie.",
  "str_quest_chat_25041009": "Heheh. Actually, I haven't decided what it'll be like yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_25041010": "I need to spend a bit of time here. Getting a feel for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25041011": "Who knows. I could turn round and be struck by inspiration at any time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25041012": "Ah!",
  "str_quest_chat_25041013": "Lilica? What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_25041014": "I didn't pay attention when I was turning round and broke the door.",
  "str_quest_chat_25041015": "Don't worry! I'll help you fix it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042001": "Hey, PlayerName. I've got a strange feeling.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042002": "What kind of feeling?",
  "str_quest_chat_25042003": "It's...",
  "str_quest_chat_25042004": "It's like when you look at some scenery and know exactly where the camera should go.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042005": "Or you meet someone and know exactly how to make a movie to tell their story.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042006": "Or you read a script and you just know it's something new and different.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042007": "And now I feel... like I can do anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_25042008": "That's great!",
  "str_quest_chat_25042009": "It means all that hard work, all that reading and all the tough times... it's paid off!",
  "str_quest_chat_25042010": "Quick! You need to decide what movie you're going to make.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042011": "PlayerName, you're awesome!",
  "str_quest_chat_25042012": "You're the only person who keeps encouraging me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042013": "I-I promise I won't let you down.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042014": "Don't get a big head.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042015": "Feelings like this come and go. Inspiration can disappear.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042016": "So don't waste it. Think about your next film.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042017": "Woah. I never imagined you would have such a good grasp of the creative process.",
  "str_quest_chat_25042018": "Relax. I won't disappoint you!",
  "str_quest_chat_25051001": "Yawn—I'm so sleepy.",
  "str_quest_chat_25051002": "Didn't you sleep well last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_25051003": "No. I was preparing for today's audition.",
  "str_quest_chat_25051004": "So yesterday was a long day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25051005": "What role are you hoping to get?",
  "str_quest_chat_25051006": "Heheh. It's a cruel and merciless bandit woman!",
  "str_quest_chat_25051007": "That... doesn't seem to match your usual image.",
  "str_quest_chat_25051008": "That's why I had to stay up late!",
  "str_quest_chat_25051009": "The dark circles around my bloodshot eyes. My tired and angry appearance...",
  "str_quest_chat_25051010": "It all gets me into character!",
  "str_quest_chat_25051011": "I should go. I'll let you know what happens.",
  "str_quest_chat_25051012": "Best of luck.",
  "str_quest_chat_25061001": "I woke up starving. What can I eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_25061002": "You just woke up?",
  "str_quest_chat_25061003": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_25061004": "But it's already noon.",
  "str_quest_chat_25061005": "Oh, is it only noon?",
  "str_quest_chat_25061006": "Hmm. And I don't think I have anything to do today. I can go back to bed!",
  "str_quest_chat_25061007": "Then I can save money on food.",
  "str_quest_chat_25061008": "I'm such a genius. Haha.",
  "str_quest_chat_25061009": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_25061010": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25061011": "Good afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_25062001": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_25062002": "Getting my work ready. You?",

  "str_quest_chat_25062004": "Don't you have any work to do today?",
  "str_quest_chat_25062005": "This is my work.",
  "str_quest_chat_25062006": "Us artists need to cultivate our cultural awareness.",
  "str_quest_chat_25062007": "If I read more today, I can make better movies tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_25062008": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_25063001": "I woke up starving. What can I eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_25063002": "PlayerName, have you had lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_25063003": "Yeah, I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_25063004": "What delicious things did you eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_25063005": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_25063006": "And what delicious things are you going to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_25063007": "Just for reference purposes.",
  "str_quest_chat_25063008": "I had an Illumina-style risotto.",
  "str_quest_chat_25063009": "A risotto? That sounds great.",
  "str_quest_chat_25063010": "You could try one, Lilica,",
  "str_quest_chat_25063011": "Oh, I love deciding what to eat!",
  "str_quest_chat_25063012": "I'm going to have... seafood pizza!",
  "str_quest_chat_25063013": "Then why even bother asking me?",
  "str_quest_chat_25063014": "If I hadn't asked you, I wouldn't know how much I want seafood pizza.",
  "str_quest_chat_25064001": "I always get so sleepy in the afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_25064002": "Why don't you go and get coffee?",
  "str_quest_chat_25064003": "I can't!",
  "str_quest_chat_25064004": "Huh? Why not?",
  "str_quest_chat_25064005": "I'm far too pale and unhealthy looking. I can't let my fans see me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25064006": "Are your fans on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_25064007": "Not now. But that doesn't mean they won't be in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_25064008": "And I need to make sure I always look my best when they see me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25064009": "Whatever. Maybe I could send a Firefly with a cup of coffee for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25064010": "Wow! Awesome.",
  "str_quest_chat_25064011": "I'll make sure my fans are kind to you as a reward.",

  "str_quest_chat_25081004": "The evening is the best time of all for us artists.",
  "str_quest_chat_25081005": "That sounds familiar...",
  "str_quest_chat_25081006": "Oh? Do you know any other megastars, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25081007": "Well, I'm not sure about megastars...",
  "str_quest_chat_25081008": "But do you know Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_25081009": "Oh!",
  "str_quest_chat_25081010": "The Acheron Ferryman? The genius of the performing arts? That Charon?",
  "str_quest_chat_25081011": "You're a friend of his?",
  "str_quest_chat_25081012": "Could you get me a signed photo?",
  "str_quest_chat_25081013": "Wait, if he's your friend, PlayerName... Could you get him to star in one of my movies? The leading role, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_25081014": "Tell him to contact me if he's interested!",
  "str_quest_chat_25081015": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_25082001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25082002": "The sun has set and I finally feel alive again.",
  "str_quest_chat_25082003": "Now, I need to review my lines for my upcoming movie.",
  "str_quest_chat_25082004": "Oh? Are you about to start filming a new one, Lilica?",
  "str_quest_chat_25082005": "Not quite. I'm still putting the funding together.",
  "str_quest_chat_25082006": "Until then, I'm doing some bit parts with other production crews.",
  "str_quest_chat_25082007": "Well, I say bit parts. I've got a lot of lines in this one.",
  "str_quest_chat_25082008": "1, 2, 3, 4... 10! I've got 10 whole lines!",
  "str_quest_chat_25082009": "Don't go thinking that's not many.",
  "str_quest_chat_25082010": "I've got to express 15 different emotions during those 10 lines. That's not something anyone can do.",
  "str_quest_chat_25082011": "Are you sure the director isn't just trying to make your life difficult?",
  "str_quest_chat_25082012": "The director? No, this was my own idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_25082013": "And it's the least I should attempt as a director myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_25082014": "Wow. You're tough on yourself, Lilica.",
  "str_quest_chat_25083001": "PlayerName... Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_25083002": "Huh? What's going on?",
  "str_quest_chat_25083003": "You're usually super-lively at this time of day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25083004": "Well, today I just... can't liven up.",
  "str_quest_chat_25083005": "I was filming a movie yesterday. The female lea—",
  "str_quest_chat_25083006": "The female lead? Congrats! I knew you'd get there sooner or later!",
  "str_quest_chat_25083007": "Let me finish. The female lead's body double.",
  "str_quest_chat_25083008": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_25083009": "And to save money, we were filming from yesterday morning all the way through to this evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_25083010": "I did every stunt in the movie, all in two days.",
  "str_quest_chat_25083011": "I'm exhausted. The sleepiest.",
  "str_quest_chat_25083012": "You should get some rest, Lilica.",
  "str_quest_chat_25083013": "When you get up I'll get you something to eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_25083014": "Oh, thanks!",
  "str_quest_chat_25101001": "Hello, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101002": "I got up earlier than usual this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101003": "And as I strolled by the river, I noticed that the flowers are particularly beautiful at this time of year.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101004": "You sure know how to enjoy life, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101005": "You're very kind.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101006": "When I returned home, I found I had been followed by a bee.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101007": "It was flying back and forth by the window. So I opened it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101008": "And sure enough, the breeze carried it homeward.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101009": "It hovered there a moment in front of me. Then buzzed off.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101010": "Ha. Sounds like you help a lost bee get home, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101011": "I did.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101012": "But should I be sharing such inconsequential matters with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25101013": "I do hope I haven't bored you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101014": "Absolutely not. Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101015": "That's good.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101016": "I've noticed lately that when something charming happens, I think of telling you about it. I don't know why.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101017": "And if you don't find it tiresome...",
  "str_quest_chat_25101018": "Perhaps I'll tell you more stories another time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25101019": "I can't wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_25102001": "Sorry, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102002": "Huh? What are you apologizing for, Minos?",
  "str_quest_chat_25102003": "Because I have a question I need to ask you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102004": "And it is of vital importance for me to have your answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102005": "That's no problem at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_25102006": "Just ask.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102007": "What is it you need to know?",
  "str_quest_chat_25102008": "First, I'd like to know what the question is.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102009": "I'd like to know what you keep by your bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102010": "By my bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_25102011": "That's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102012": "You can tell a lot about a person by what they choose to keep by their bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102013": "For example, Miss Nina has dolls and shiny gemstones.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102014": "My master has books and always prepares self-defense weaponry.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102015": "But I don't think there's anything unusual about what I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102016": "A glass of water. My journal and a few pens. That's it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102017": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102018": "Thank you for being so kind as to answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102019": "I'll try keeping the same things by my bed so I can better look after you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25102020": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_25102021": "Now you're making me feel bad...",
  "str_quest_chat_25103001": "Hello, honorable Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103002": "I hope this invitation does not disturb you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103003": "Ah, Minos. Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103004": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_25103005": "Master Androma is to hold a party at Andersen Mansion this evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103006": "He plans to make an important announcement during the event.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103007": "And as you are a friend of Miss Nina's, you too are among the invitees.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103008": "Would you be able to grace us with your presence?",
  "str_quest_chat_25103009": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_25103010": "You'll be providing food, won't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25103011": "Yes, Mr. Navigator.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103012": "If you are ready, we can set off for Andersen Mansion right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103013": "Master Androma has prepared rooms for the guests to wait in.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103014": "I'll wait for you in the Cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103015": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_25103999": "Minos is waiting for you in the Cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141001": "Hello, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141002": "I have long looked forward to this meeting.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141003": "Welcome, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141004": "Thank you very much for your kind welcome.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141005": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_25141006": "If I'm honest, that was just my normal welcome.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141007": "But your words truly made me feel at home, so I mean it when I say them to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141008": "O-Okay, I'm glad...",
  "str_quest_chat_25141009": "But I'm also very sorry. As the Andersen family's butler...",
  "str_quest_chat_25141010": "I regret I'll be unable to remain permanently by your side and attend to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141011": "However, I will do whatever I can to take care of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141012": "After all, \"butlering\" is what I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141013": "Actually, I don't think I need you to do that, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141014": "In fact, here on the Colossus, we all look after each other.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141015": "Oh, I see. Very well, I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141016": "Nevertheless, I'm glad you are here.",
  "str_quest_chat_25141017": "And I will offer my sincere thanks for your welcome, honorable PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142001": "Honorable PlayerName, do you happen to have some time?",
  "str_quest_chat_25142002": "I have some things to tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142003": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_25142004": "Recently, I've been spending a lot of time shopping in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142005": "I've been looking for a gift for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142006": "A-A gift for me? Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_25142007": "Hmm. To put it plainly, I think you've been of great help to me lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142008": "Because I find it very hard to trust people outside the Andersen family.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142009": "That makes it hard to talk to outsiders.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142010": "And as a butler, there are things I cannot discuss with my master and Miss Nina.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142011": "What do you mean by \"things\"? Things that are bothering you? That you need a friend to talk to about?",
  "str_quest_chat_25142012": "I think that is about the size of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142013": "When we talk, I often find myself feeling more relaxed.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142014": "And being relaxed helps me make progress in other unexpected ways too.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142015": "And at the end of the day, all that progress is because I met you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142016": "I... I never thought that I could be of any help to people like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142017": "And I think you could learn to relax by yourself, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142018": "Or at least you could stop being so polite to me all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142019": "It creates a lot of distance between us.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142020": "Ah, sorry. I could not do that.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142021": "As a butler, it is crucial that I'm polite at all times.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142022": "Anyway, as I was saying: I'm going to buy you a gift.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142023": "It'll be a carefully selected token of my esteem.",
  "str_quest_chat_25142024": "Then let me thank you in advance, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143001": "Honorable PlayerName, I've been ever so slightly confused lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143002": "Oh? About what?",
  "str_quest_chat_25143003": "I'm not sure if you have the same sensation...",
  "str_quest_chat_25143004": "I feel the air in the Colossus has been quite dry lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143005": "But perhaps it's just me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143006": "And I've been feeling very thirsty lately. I find myself drinking gallons of water after every battle.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143007": "Even more so than usual.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143008": "I can't say I've noticed anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143009": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_25143010": "Me too!",
  "str_quest_chat_25143011": "I knew it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143012": "I know why you've noticed that, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143013": "Please continue.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143014": "It must be because you're burning up more energy during combat, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25143015": "And if you're burning up more energy, you'll need to drink more water. See?",
  "str_quest_chat_25143016": "Could the answer really be so simple?",
  "str_quest_chat_25143017": "Hmm. And now I think about it, you've been fighting better lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143018": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143019": "You certainly have impressive powers of observation.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143020": "But let's not forget that improvement is all thanks to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143021": "So I'm very grateful, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25143022": "I'm just happy to be able to help.",
  "str_quest_chat_25151001": "Breakfast is ready.",
  "str_quest_chat_25151002": "We've got a special tea from Northland, grilled meats from the desert...",
  "str_quest_chat_25151003": "Army-issue canned meat from Illumina and bread from Lumopolis Gardens.",
  "str_quest_chat_25151004": "You see, I didn't know what you would want for breakfast. Or when you would get up.",
  "str_quest_chat_25151005": "So I put together a bit of everything and left it by your door.",
  "str_quest_chat_25151006": "Of course, I made sure it stayed warm.",
  "str_quest_chat_25151007": "I hope you enjoy it! Once you're up, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_25151008": "Oh. Morning, Minos",
  "str_quest_chat_25151009": "Thanks a million!",
  "str_quest_chat_25151010": "I'm merely completing my duties as a butler.",
  "str_quest_chat_25152001": "Good morning, honorable PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25152002": "May I wish you, most sincerely, the happiest of days.",
  "str_quest_chat_25152003": "Minos, you are always so formal!",
  "str_quest_chat_25152004": "Because I just met with some misfortune.",
  "str_quest_chat_25152005": "I was out picking some fresh fruits so I could squeeze some juice for my master and Miss Nina.",
  "str_quest_chat_25152006": "And one fell from the tree and landed on my head!",
  "str_quest_chat_25152007": "And so I wanted to wish you a luckier day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25152008": "Right. Are you okay? Does your head hurt?",
  "str_quest_chat_25152009": "I'm fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_25152010": "In fact, I'm merely glad it was I who was hit and not yourself or Miss Nina.",
  "str_quest_chat_25152011": "If you'll excuse me...",
  "str_quest_chat_25152012": "Oh. Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_25153001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_25153002": "Morning, Minos",
  "str_quest_chat_25153003": "Sometimes, when I don't have enough time to prepare the usual Andersen family breakfast, I make an alternative for Miss Nina.",
  "str_quest_chat_25153004": "And what's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_25153005": "You certainly take your responsibilities seriously, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25153006": "I'm merely performing my duties.",
  "str_quest_chat_25153007": "I make sure to provide nutritious food.",
  "str_quest_chat_25153008": "And obviously, I make them as attractive as possible to ensure she finds her meal pleasurable.",
  "str_quest_chat_25153009": "That's amazing!",
  "str_quest_chat_25153010": "I'll come to the Colossus and make you some.",
  "str_quest_chat_25153011": "Would you? That would be awesome.",
  "str_quest_chat_25161001": "What would you like for lunch?",
  "str_quest_chat_25161002": "Anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_25161003": "Hmm. Okay, let me think a moment.",
  "str_quest_chat_25161004": "I'm not hungry yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_25161005": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_25161006": "I've taken account of your culinary preferences and produced a number of themed meals for you to choose from.",
  "str_quest_chat_25161007": "You can make your choice when you're ready to eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_25161008": "Minos, I'm always amazed by your attention to detail.",
  "str_quest_chat_25161009": "Thank you for the compliment.",
  "str_quest_chat_25162001": "Good afternoon, honorable PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25162002": "Miss Nina has gone to the opera.",
  "str_quest_chat_25162003": "I made her a lunch to take and, while doing so, prepared something for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25162004": "I've sent a Firefly to deliver it to your door.",
  "str_quest_chat_25162005": "Oh! Okay, I'll go and get it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25162006": "Thanks, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25162007": "My pleasure.",
  "str_quest_chat_25163001": "Good afternoon, honorable PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25163002": "I hope you have a wonderful day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25163003": "Hello Minos. I hope you do too.",
  "str_quest_chat_25163004": "Unfortunately, I'm sure not to.",
  "str_quest_chat_25163005": "Miss Nina ate less bread than usual before lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_25163006": "I must find out why before dinner.",
  "str_quest_chat_25163007": "Minos, you really are a very attentive butler.",
  "str_quest_chat_25163008": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181001": "It's time to go to bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181002": "I'm not in bed yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181003": "Then you are not being a good child.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181004": "I'm going soon.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181005": "Good boy.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181006": "You're reminding me of when Miss Nina was a little girl.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181007": "Every evening I had to visit her room to turn out the lights and check the windows were secure.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181008": "Of course, I could do that for you if you wish.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181009": "I can look after myself, Minos. But thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181010": "Very well. Don't stay up too late.",
  "str_quest_chat_25181011": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_25182001": "Good evening, honorable PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25182002": "I sometimes find that doing a jigsaw puzzle can help me sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_25182003": "Oh, I didn't know you liked jigsaws, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25182004": "I just do one every now and then.",
  "str_quest_chat_25182005": "I like watching the chaos of tiny pieces become a coherent image.",
  "str_quest_chat_25182006": "I think it helps me organize my own thoughts.",
  "str_quest_chat_25182007": "My confused ideas rearrange themselves in a more orderly fashion. And that means I sleep better.",
  "str_quest_chat_25182008": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_25182009": "You could try it next time you can't sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_25182010": "Anyway, I'll say good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_25182011": "Okay. Good night, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25183001": "It's late, honorable PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25183002": "It is. How come you're still awake, Minos?",
  "str_quest_chat_25183003": "I'm about to do some stretching exercises. Then I'll sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_25183004": "My master held a dinner this evening, and my shoulders are somewhat stiff.",
  "str_quest_chat_25183005": "Doing some stretches will make it much easier to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_25183006": "I've always thought of you as tireless, Minos.",
  "str_quest_chat_25183007": "Pfff... That's an amusing idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_25183008": "Do get some sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_25183009": "And you too, after your stretches.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201001": "Mon and Dad asked me if I'd made any new friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201002": "I'm sure you have, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25201003": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201004": "So what did you tell them?",
  "str_quest_chat_25201005": "I told them you were my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201006": "Oh. Thanks, Sadie.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201007": "They were quite surprised.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201008": "Because you're not one of those super super super super super cool girls.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201009": "How many supers was that?",
  "str_quest_chat_25201010": "So I explained that sometimes it's good for a gal to have a weird older pal.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201011": "So I guess I'm the weird older person? And Allura and Areia are super cool girls?",
  "str_quest_chat_25201012": "Obviously.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201013": "Is calling you a weird older person bad? How come you aren't happy?",
  "str_quest_chat_25201014": "It means I think of you as a friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201015": "Okay then. I'm happy to be your friend, Sadie. Really.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201016": "But I'm wondering if maybe I should update my image.",
  "str_quest_chat_25201017": "Sounds good!",
  "str_quest_chat_25201018": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_25202001": "Hey, I have a question I'd like to ask.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202002": "It's not like you to be so hesitant. Come on, what is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_25202003": "Phew... Okay then!",
  "str_quest_chat_25202004": "I want to know what material your headband is made of.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202005": "I want to make one just like it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202006": "Although it'll be black and purple to match my clothes.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202007": "What do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_25202008": "You can do that if you want, Sadie. I don't mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202009": "But I'm afraid I don't know what material it's made of.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202010": "Oh, really? Then I'll try and figure it out.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202011": "I don't know why, but I really want a headband just like yours!",
  "str_quest_chat_25202012": "I mean, it looks so stupid at first. But over time, it kind of grows on you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202013": "Sadie, I can't tell if you're complimenting me or insulting me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202014": "It's a compliment. Obviously!",
  "str_quest_chat_25202015": "I think your headband really suits you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202016": "Ah. Haha. Okay then. Thanks, Sadie.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202017": "I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with.",
  "str_quest_chat_25202018": "Yeah! I'm going to do my very best!",
  "str_quest_chat_25203001": "PlayerName! It looks as if you're in need of aid. And a friend in need I'll never evade!",
  "str_quest_chat_25203002": "Tell me what I can do, you need just ask. Super Sadie Swashbuckler 666 is up to the task!",
  "str_quest_chat_25203003": "I do need help. This crate weighs a ton.",
  "str_quest_chat_25203004": "It's on a hand cart but I still can't shift it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25203005": "But it doesn't seem fair to ask a child to help.",
  "str_quest_chat_25203006": "Don't underestimate Super Sadie! Watch and learn, matey!",
  "str_quest_chat_25203007": "It's just moving a heavy mass. Let me at it, I'm your lass!",
  "str_quest_chat_25203008": "You certainly seem strong enough. Okay, go for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25203009": "I'll wait for you in the Cafe. Then we can shift it together.",
  "str_quest_chat_25203010": "You can just stand by and give me directions, PlayerName. Super Sadie Swashbuckler 666 works single-handed!",
  "str_quest_chat_25203999": "Sadie has already pushed the wooden chest a pretty far distance. Go chase after her!",
  "str_quest_chat_25241001": "I'm best at batting practice!",
  "str_quest_chat_25241002": "Accuracy increased!",
  "str_quest_chat_25241003": "Destruction increased!",
  "str_quest_chat_25241004": "Hitting speed increased!",
  "str_quest_chat_25241005": "I'm best at batting practice!",
  "str_quest_chat_25241006": "Oh, I shouldn't be so proud of myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_25241007": "I don't think you're being too proud, Sadie.",
  "str_quest_chat_25241008": "Self-confidence is a valuable thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_25241009": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_25241010": "Of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_25241011": "Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_25241012": "Ahh. No matter what, lying on the grass after a tough practice feels great.",
  "str_quest_chat_25241013": "I love it!",
  "str_quest_chat_25241014": "Let's lie on the grass together after my next practice.",
  "str_quest_chat_25241015": "And you can use my new comic book as a pillow, as a thank you for helping me practice.",
  "str_quest_chat_25241016": "Sure. But...",
  "str_quest_chat_25241017": "I'll stick to lying on the grass. I won't need a comic book pillow. Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_25251001": "Are you awake? I was about to sneak out.",
  "str_quest_chat_25251002": "I'm up!",
  "str_quest_chat_25251003": "But why are you going out so early, Sadie?",
  "str_quest_chat_25251004": "No reason.",
  "str_quest_chat_25251005": "It's just... the early swashbuckler gets... to steal the worm's purse!",
  "str_quest_chat_25251006": "You've got lots of energy.",
  "str_quest_chat_25252001": "Today I got my hands particularly clean. It's an important part of a swashbuckler's routine.",
  "str_quest_chat_25252002": "Wait, you washed your hands today?",
  "str_quest_chat_25252003": "Don't you wash them every day?",
  "str_quest_chat_25252004": "So... you never washed your hands properly before?",
  "str_quest_chat_25252005": "I do! But today, I was especially careful.",
  "str_quest_chat_25252006": "Haha. I'm just teasing.",
  "str_quest_chat_25252007": "Hmph. Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_25252008": "I'm going out to look at handbags. Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_25252009": "Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_25261001": "Noon is not the best time for swashbuckling.",
  "str_quest_chat_25261002": "Why do you say that?",
  "str_quest_chat_25261003": "It's hard to look dashing when you're dripping with sweat.",
  "str_quest_chat_25261004": "And the cloak would stick to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25261005": "Yuck. Yeah, you're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_25261006": "So, Super Sadie Swashbuckler 666 will return later this afternoon. Goodbye!",
  "str_quest_chat_25261007": "Oh. Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_25262001": "What's the best thing for lunch? Ice-cream. Munch munch.",
  "str_quest_chat_25262002": "You shouldn't eat so much.",
  "str_quest_chat_25262003": "You don't understand, PlayerName. You have to shovel it in to really enjoy it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25262004": "I want some too.",
  "str_quest_chat_25262005": "That's it!",
  "str_quest_chat_25262006": "You can get some from the kitchen.",
  "str_quest_chat_25262007": "So, Sadie... is eating ice cream part of the swashbuckling culture?",
  "str_quest_chat_25262008": "Not at all. I just like eating ice cream.",
  "str_quest_chat_25262009": "Huh. I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_25262010": "PlayerName thinks hard and long. Such a shame he's always wrong.",
  "str_quest_chat_25262011": "... Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_25281001": "Hurry! Quick! You can't believe... how much I have to do this eve!",
  "str_quest_chat_25281002": "There's a cat on the corner having kittens. I hope they're cute, and I'll call one Mittens!",
  "str_quest_chat_25281003": "So tonight, I may not reach my bed. Don't wait up, PlayerName. Just rest your head.",
  "str_quest_chat_25281004": "Be a good boy and stay there waiting for any updates.",
  "str_quest_chat_25281005": "Yeah, I wonder if you'll ever take a breath and let me get an update of my own.",
  "str_quest_chat_25281006": "Anyway... Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_25281007": "Yeah, good night. Stay safe.",
  "str_quest_chat_25282001": "I want to read my comics, but I'm so tired.",
  "str_quest_chat_25282002": "So sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_25282003": "Hmm.",
  "str_quest_chat_25282004": "Just read for another 10 minutes?",
  "str_quest_chat_25282005": "Let me think.",
  "str_quest_chat_25282006": "Look, sleep whenever you want to. But don't stay up all night reading.",
  "str_quest_chat_25282007": "It's best if I go to sleep now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25282008": "Are you going to sleep too, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25282009": "Yeah, it's almost time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25282010": "Say good night then.",
  "str_quest_chat_25282011": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301001": "The control panel aboard your Colossus has no way of producing the music I want to hear, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301002": "Huh? So what kind of music do you want to hear, Axelia?",
  "str_quest_chat_25301003": "My favorite type of music. I wish to share it with you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301004": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_25301005": "I'm not entirely sure if you'll like it or not.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301006": "But I really want to show it to you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301007": "Are you feeling alright, Axelia?",
  "str_quest_chat_25301008": "Do you need me to go check on you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25301009": "Er, wh-what I meant to say is, I can have the Fireflies help move your stasis chamber out of the room...",
  "str_quest_chat_25301010": "I actually feel very well-rested today.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301011": "Oh, okay. That's good to hear.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301012": "Don't leave your room, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_25301013": "Only if PlayerName will accept my advice.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301014": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_25301015": "I recorded a song on two different Fireflies.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301016": "I sent one of them to you. Once it arrives, give it the command \"play song\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_25301017": "That way, even if we're in separate rooms, we can use the Fireflies to listen to the same song at the same time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301018": "That's a great idea!",
  "str_quest_chat_25301019": "Okay, the Firefly just showed up...",
  "str_quest_chat_25301020": "Play song.",
  "str_quest_chat_25301021": "Play song!",
  "str_quest_chat_25302001": "Do you like pop rocks, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25302002": "Uh... I guess, yeah?",
  "str_quest_chat_25302003": "I mean, who doesn't like sweets, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25302004": "I noticed that I've been eating less and less pop rocks lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_25302005": "I used to like them very much before.",
  "str_quest_chat_25302006": "What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_25302007": "I liked eating pop rocks because of the unique sensation they gave me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25302008": "A special and sweet taste, coupled with the excitement from the unpredictable popping and crackling...",
  "str_quest_chat_25302009": "This is what pop rocks used to make me feel.",
  "str_quest_chat_25302010": "But I no longer need them to feel this sensation anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_25302011": "Uh...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25302012": "Right now, as I use this Terminal to communicate with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25302013": "I feel the physiological response is extremely similar to eating pop rocks.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303001": "PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303002": "I have a question for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303003": "Hmm? What problem?",
  "str_quest_chat_25303004": "What does it feel like to lose?",
  "str_quest_chat_25303005": "Well... You feel discouraged and frustrated, I guess.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303006": "Axelia, I know you're good at fighting.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303007": "But are you asking because you've never lost before?",
  "str_quest_chat_25303008": "Other than fighting, it's still possible to lose when playing games or riddles.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303009": "Games or riddles?",
  "str_quest_chat_25303010": "I'm curious about these things.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303011": "Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303012": "Well, I've been playing an interesting game recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303013": "If you're interested, we can try it together.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303014": "Then, I'll be waiting for you in the Cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303015": "Now?",
  "str_quest_chat_25303016": "All right, got it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303017": "See you later.",
  "str_quest_chat_25303999": "Axelia is waiting for you in the Cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_25341001": "Axelia, the Combat Cyborg, is reporting for duty.",
  "str_quest_chat_25341002": "Command me into battle as you see fit. I will be your most powerful weapon.",
  "str_quest_chat_25341003": "Ah! Uh... O-Okay, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_25341004": "I'm still not used to being addressed like this, Axelia.",
  "str_quest_chat_25341005": "Or rather, I don't really know how to respond.",
  "str_quest_chat_25341006": "I don't think I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_25341007": "W-Well... What I mean is, you're a living, breathing Aurorian, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25341008": "I know everyone has their own unique way of communicating with other people...",
  "str_quest_chat_25341009": "But I just want you to know that here on the Colossus, we don't give each other orders; we talk to one another as equals.",
  "str_quest_chat_25341010": "Understood. Axelia, the Combat Cyborg, will interact with others according to your instructions.",
  "str_quest_chat_25341011": "Now then, please initiate a conversation with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25341012": "N-Never mind, don't worry about it for now. This is definitely going to take some time and practice...",
  "str_quest_chat_25341013": "In any case, welcome aboard, Axelia!",
  "str_quest_chat_25341014": "\"Welcome\"...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25341015": "... I understand now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25342001": "It appears I can remain awake for a while longer now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25342002": "What could that mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_25342003": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_25342004": "Could it be that my condition is worsening?",
  "str_quest_chat_25342005": "Strange. My body hasn't shown any indications of deteriorating recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_25342006": "If I had to guess...",
  "str_quest_chat_25342007": "This change must have something to do with you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25342008": "It appears I have gained something new from all of our recent battles together.",
  "str_quest_chat_25342009": "Your psychic abilities are quite impressive, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25342010": "As much as I'd like to accept your praise, Axelia...",
  "str_quest_chat_25342011": "I'm just happy to see that you're improving so much.",
  "str_quest_chat_25342012": "In that case... I will work even harder to improve as a token of my gratitude for your help.",
  "str_quest_chat_25343001": "It appears the joints in my legs need to be replaced.",
  "str_quest_chat_25343002": "Now that you mention it...",
  "str_quest_chat_25343003": "Doesn't it hurt when you replace your joints like this?",
  "str_quest_chat_25343004": "Hurt?",
  "str_quest_chat_25343005": "Do you believe that machines can feel pain, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25343006": "My legs are entirely mechanical.",
  "str_quest_chat_25343007": "The rate of wear on my part has accelerated recently, indicating a substantial increase in use.",
  "str_quest_chat_25343008": "You have been putting me to good use, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25343009": "Because so many of our recent battles have resulted in victories, I need to ensure that my body remains in an optimal, combat-ready state.",
  "str_quest_chat_25343010": "I-I mean, if you want to put it that way...",
  "str_quest_chat_25343011": "Fulfilling my role as a combat cyborg is what gives meaning to my existence.",
  "str_quest_chat_25343012": "I hope you can understand and acknowledge this, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25343013": "Y-Yeah, sure...",
  "str_quest_chat_25343014": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25344001": "It appears my capabilities have been greatly enhanced recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_25344002": "You mean you've improved lately, right, Axelia?",
  "str_quest_chat_25344003": "\"Improved\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_25344004": "An unquantifiable statement, given the circumstances.",
  "str_quest_chat_25344005": "I believe \"enhanced\" is a much more fitting term for my current state.",
  "str_quest_chat_25344006": "Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to see you getting stronger and all, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_25344007": "I really don't think you should keep describing yourself like this, Axelia!",
  "str_quest_chat_25344008": "Say, here's an idea.",
  "str_quest_chat_25344009": "Let's take a step back for a second, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_25344010": "I don't think I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_25344011": "Instead of saying you've \"improved\" or that your capabilities are \"enhanced\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_25344012": "Why don't we just say—\"I've gotten much stronger!\" What do you think, Axelia?",
  "str_quest_chat_25344013": "We can't go wrong with that, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25344014": "... Very well.",
  "str_quest_chat_25344015": "I-I have gotten much stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_25344016": "Yeah! Just like that, Axelia!",
  "str_quest_chat_25344017": "I have to admit. It still doesn't sound very fitting to me...",
  "str_quest_chat_25344018": "But still, thank you PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25351001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_25351002": "The breakfasts aboard the Colossus are quite delicious.",
  "str_quest_chat_25351003": "Glad to hear you enjoy the food, Axelia.",
  "str_quest_chat_25351004": "However, I always find myself feeling tired again after finishing my meal.",
  "str_quest_chat_25351005": "Cubes tell me that overconsumption of sustenance causes this exhaustion.",
  "str_quest_chat_25351006": "It sounds like you were just sleepy from getting full, wasn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_25351007": "If you ask me, you really should be eating more, Axelia.",
  "str_quest_chat_25351008": "People usually say that it's bad for you to overeat or sleep in, but in your case, I think it might be good for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25351009": "Oh? I see... In that case, I will now prepare to sleep more.",
  "str_quest_chat_25351010": "Sure thing. Get plenty of rest, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_25352001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_25352002": "Some of the Aurorians from Northland tell me that you can see snowfall almost every morning in their homeland.",
  "str_quest_chat_25352003": "Have you also seen snow, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25352004": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_25352005": "Snowy days have a certain atmosphere to them, but aside from that, they're nothing too special.",
  "str_quest_chat_25352006": "I haven't.",
  "str_quest_chat_25352007": "Even though I've been to Northland...",
  "str_quest_chat_25352008": "I don't think I've seen it snow... At least not in the way that people usually describe it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25352009": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_25352010": "Do you want to see snow someday, Axelia?",
  "str_quest_chat_25352011": "No. I'm not authorized to feel that way about anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_25352012": "I was just making conversation, that is all.",
  "str_quest_chat_25352013": "I should be going now. Good-bye, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25352014": "Uh... Okay? Bye.",
  "str_quest_chat_25353001": "It seems I've grown accustomed to eating breakfast now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25353002": "Huh? You mean you didn't eat breakfast before, Axelia?",
  "str_quest_chat_25353003": "No. Unless I was awakened for combat, I spent the rest of my time lying dormant in my stasis chamber.",
  "str_quest_chat_25353004": "I see. Well, if that's the case...",
  "str_quest_chat_25353005": "I think you've developed a very healthy habit, Axelia.",
  "str_quest_chat_25353006": "Is that so? Interesting. Cubes seem to think so, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_25353007": "Well then, have a pleasant morning, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25353008": "See you later, Axelia.",
  "str_quest_chat_25361001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_25361002": "Good afternoon, Axelia.",
  "str_quest_chat_25361003": "Up so soon from your stasis chamber?",
  "str_quest_chat_25361004": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_25361005": "I'm currently on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_25361006": "Watching everyone working aboard the Colossus. They all look so happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_25361007": "I'm glad you feel that way, Axelia.",
  "str_quest_chat_25361008": "Seeing everyone like this... It makes me feel happy, as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_25362001": "It's noon now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25362002": "It always feels so warm inside the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_25362003": "Is the temperature okay for you, Axelia?",
  "str_quest_chat_25362004": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_25362005": "So you like how warm it is?",
  "str_quest_chat_25362006": "I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_25362007": "But now... I'm going to the cafeteria to have lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_25362008": "Sounds good. Can't wait to hear what you think about the food!",
  "str_quest_chat_25362009": "Have a nice day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25363001": "Shaved ice in the afternoon... What a delightful and unexpected treat.",
  "str_quest_chat_25363002": "Feel free to have as much as you like, Axelia!",
  "str_quest_chat_25363003": "Can I have more?",
  "str_quest_chat_25363004": "Unless you prefer to eat less in the afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_25363005": "... S-Sorry, I was just trying to account for your condition.",
  "str_quest_chat_25363006": "Of course, you're more than welcome to have more as long as you're feeling well!",
  "str_quest_chat_25363007": "I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_25363008": "Our shaved ice comes in lots of flavors.",
  "str_quest_chat_25363009": "Pick whichever ones you like, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_25363010": "Understood.",
  "str_quest_chat_25381001": "Sleep well.",
  "str_quest_chat_25381002": "I will watch over this place.",
  "str_quest_chat_25381003": "Hmm? The Colossus is perfectly safe, Axelia. Why don't you get some rest too?",
  "str_quest_chat_25381004": "I had enough rest during the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25381005": "I-I see... Why don't you go and check out the Rec Room?",
  "str_quest_chat_25381006": "You can listen to music there, if you like.",
  "str_quest_chat_25381007": "Music?",
  "str_quest_chat_25381008": "I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_25381009": "I'll go there and listen to some electronic music now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25381010": "Good night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25381011": "Good night, Axelia.",
  "str_quest_chat_25382001": "Good evening... Wub wub wub.",
  "str_quest_chat_25382002": "Uh...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25382003": "Bwoooow—wub wub wub wub.",
  "str_quest_chat_25382004": "This is the kind of music I was listening to just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25382005": "Oh! So is this the kind of music you like, Axelia?",
  "str_quest_chat_25382006": "I wouldn't say I \"like\" it... I just listen to it fairly often.",
  "str_quest_chat_25382007": "Sure, I get it. I'll have to listen to it next time I have the chance.",
  "str_quest_chat_25382008": "Very well... Good night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25382009": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_25401001": "By the way, do you see a doctor for regular check-ups?",
  "str_quest_chat_25401002": "Check-ups? No, not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_25401003": "Well, that won't do!",
  "str_quest_chat_25401004": "I mean, I did go to the clinic for a full-body exam a few days ago.",
  "str_quest_chat_25401005": "The clinic? Why didn't you ask me, instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_25401006": "A run-of-the-mill clinic can't offer you the same quality of health care as I can!",
  "str_quest_chat_25401007": "Check-ups are the best and easiest way for you to assess your current state of health.",
  "str_quest_chat_25401008": "You should take them more seriously, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_25401009": "As your friend, I refuse to let you skip your regular check-ups like this!",
  "str_quest_chat_25401010": "That settles it: I'm coming to find you right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_25401011": "I'll show you what a real full-body exam should be!",
  "str_quest_chat_25401012": "Just wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_25401013": "W-Wait, Beretta!",
  "str_quest_chat_25401014": "Let's not be hasty! I promise I'll come to see you next time, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_25401015": "Beretta?",
  "str_quest_chat_25401016": "You're not really coming over to see me, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25402001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_25402002": "Are you interested in massage therapy?",
  "str_quest_chat_25402003": "Very much so!",
  "str_quest_chat_25402004": "Wonderful!",
  "str_quest_chat_25402005": "It's alright. Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_25402006": "I received a coupon for an Umbraton massage parlor a few days ago!",
  "str_quest_chat_25402007": "Originally, I wanted to invite Lady Raphael for some much-needed rest and relaxation.",
  "str_quest_chat_25402008": "But she got a last-minute assignment and can't make it anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_25402009": "So that's why I wanted to see if you were available!",
  "str_quest_chat_25402010": "It's on me this time! Interested?",
  "str_quest_chat_25402011": "Wow, that sounds great!",
  "str_quest_chat_25402012": "You don't need to treat me or anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_25402013": "I could go for some rest and relaxation either way!",
  "str_quest_chat_25402014": "I've been running all over the place lately, so I've felt a little worn out...",
  "str_quest_chat_25402015": "Wonderful!",
  "str_quest_chat_25402016": "I'll send you the time and place later, then!",
  "str_quest_chat_25402017": "We'll meet up there, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_25402018": "Got it!",
  "str_quest_chat_25403001": "PlayerName, I'm at the Lounge with Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_25403002": "Can you come too if you're free?",
  "str_quest_chat_25403003": "There's something I need your help with, and I wanted to talk to you about it in person!",
  "str_quest_chat_25403004": "Huh? Okay, I'll be there soon!",
  "str_quest_chat_25403999": "It seems like there's something Beretta wants to ask you and Vice about. Go to her in the Lounge!",
  "str_quest_chat_25441001": "I have some good news to share with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_25441002": "What's the good news?",
  "str_quest_chat_25441003": "The flowers that Lady Raphael asked me to take care of—They finally bloomed!",
  "str_quest_chat_25441004": "Wow! Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat_25441005": "I know that taking care of flowers can be pretty difficult sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat_25441006": "That's right! You have to water them and tend to the soil every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25441007": "As well as make sure they get just the right amount of sunlight.",
  "str_quest_chat_25441008": "Each planter requires a different amount of time in the sun too!",
  "str_quest_chat_25441009": "Though I have to admit when I'm taking care of them...",
  "str_quest_chat_25441010": "It really puts my body and mind at ease.",
  "str_quest_chat_25441011": "That must be why Raphael asked you to take care of those flowers!",
  "str_quest_chat_25441012": "It's true. I need to do my best to become more steady.",
  "str_quest_chat_25441013": "I can't afford to let Lady Raphael's efforts be in vain!",
  "str_quest_chat_25442001": "Are you okay, Beretta? Carleen told me that you passed out today!",
  "str_quest_chat_25442002": "Are you feeling sick?",
  "str_quest_chat_25442003": "I'm fine, don't worry about me!",
  "str_quest_chat_25442004": "Though I can't believe even Lady Carleen knows about it...",
  "str_quest_chat_25442005": "What exactly happened, Beretta?",
  "str_quest_chat_25442006": "Nothing, really.",
  "str_quest_chat_25442007": "I just spent two full days performing surgery on a very ill patient, that's all.",
  "str_quest_chat_25442008": "Once I finished the operation, my legs gave out from under me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25442009": "But the surgery was a success!",
  "str_quest_chat_25442010": "The patient finally woke up too!",
  "str_quest_chat_25442011": "That's incredible!",
  "str_quest_chat_25442012": "But even though I'm happy for your patient...",
  "str_quest_chat_25442013": "You should really take better care of yourself, Beretta.",
  "str_quest_chat_25442014": "Like I said, there's nothing to worry about. All of my usual training is in preparation for situations like this!",
  "str_quest_chat_25442015": "It seems I've gotten one step closer to reaching Dr. John.",
  "str_quest_chat_25442016": "I have to work even harder now!",
  "str_quest_chat_25451001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_25451002": "Do you know what \"meditation\" is?",
  "str_quest_chat_25451003": "\"Meditation\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_25451004": "Yeah! It's my latest task from Lady Raphael.",
  "str_quest_chat_25451005": "She told me I could use meditation to keep myself calm.",
  "str_quest_chat_25451006": "But no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to settle down...",
  "str_quest_chat_25451007": "Am I doing it wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_25451008": "Well, since you don't seem to know anything about it... I guess I'll have to ask someone else!",
  "str_quest_chat_25451009": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_25451010": "O-Okay, then.",
  "str_quest_chat_25461001": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_25461002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_25461003": "I'm trying my hand at cooking today. Come grab a bite when you have a minute!",
  "str_quest_chat_25461004": "Sure! What are you making?",
  "str_quest_chat_25461005": "Huh? You can cook?",
  "str_quest_chat_25461006": "... Beretta?",
  "str_quest_chat_25461007": "Are you okay? You haven't replied for a while now!",
  "str_quest_chat_25461008": "Sorry! I was in a hurry, so I set the fire to \"high\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_25461009": "And I ended up burning down the kitchen.",
  "str_quest_chat_25461010": "Oh well! Better luck next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_25461011": "H-Hey! Be careful over there!",
  "str_quest_chat_25462001": "PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_25462002": "You know Dr. Corax, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25462003": "Yeah, why?",
  "str_quest_chat_25462004": "Wow! Think you can recommend me to him?",
  "str_quest_chat_25462005": "I'm one of his biggest fans!",
  "str_quest_chat_25462006": "His textbooks on medicine are all so informative yet easy to understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_25462007": "They're chockfull of super-useful medical knowledge and techniques!",
  "str_quest_chat_25462008": "I have tons and tons of questions to ask him!",
  "str_quest_chat_25462009": "Sure, I'll ask him later.",
  "str_quest_chat_25462010": "Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_25481001": "Have you been having trouble sleeping lately?",
  "str_quest_chat_25481002": "Maybe a little... Wait, how did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_25481003": "Call it a doctor's intuition.",
  "str_quest_chat_25481004": "Also... The circles around your eyes look especially serious today.",
  "str_quest_chat_25481005": "A good night's sleep is extremely important for maintaining good health, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_25481006": "Maybe you just need a little injection?",
  "str_quest_chat_25481007": "You'll see results right away, and there are no side effects to worry about! I promise!",
  "str_quest_chat_25481008": "It'll work better than any sleeping pill out there!",
  "str_quest_chat_25481009": "N-No thanks, I'm good!",
  "str_quest_chat_25501001": "PlayerName, are you busy right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_25501002": "What's the matter, Goldie?",
  "str_quest_chat_25501003": "Marshmallow's been down in the dumps all afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_25501004": "It's just been lying motionless on the sofa...",
  "str_quest_chat_25501005": "Whenever I call out to it, it just ignores me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25501006": "It usually comes running up to greet me with the warmest welcome!",
  "str_quest_chat_25501007": "Is Marshmallow sick?",
  "str_quest_chat_25501008": "It was bouncing around full of beans this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_25501009": "Maybe Marshmallow's hungry?",
  "str_quest_chat_25501010": "Huh? But I gave it so much food today.",
  "str_quest_chat_25501011": "I guess that's not the reason.",
  "str_quest_chat_25501012": "How about you take a look around Marshmallow and see if you find anything strange...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25501013": "Ah! Marshmallow!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_25501014": "It ripped my hat and hid it underneath itself!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_25501015": "Marshmallow!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_25501016": "It looks like another round of drama is about to begin...",
  "str_quest_chat_25502001": "PlayerName, have you eaten anything decent today?",
  "str_quest_chat_25502002": "I had some bread and butter. It was good.",
  "str_quest_chat_25502003": "Oh, you're so lucky! I'm on the most awful of diets!",
  "str_quest_chat_25502004": "It's been three weeks in a row... No, it's been a month—",
  "str_quest_chat_25502005": "At times like these, I wonder to myself—would life be better if I were not an idol?",
  "str_quest_chat_25502006": "You're really strict with yourself about being an idol...",
  "str_quest_chat_25502007": "In fact, I think you just want to vent it out now and then.",
  "str_quest_chat_25502008": "I know that being an idol is your dream. Nothing will change that.",
  "str_quest_chat_25502009": "You know me so well, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25502010": "Next time... Next time, I'll secretly eat something tasty.",
  "str_quest_chat_25502011": "Then I'll just run ten kilometers to burn off the calories!",
  "str_quest_chat_25502012": "Becoming an idol really sounds exhausting...",
  "str_quest_chat_25503001": "PlayerName, are you afraid of the dark?",
  "str_quest_chat_25503002": "Erm... Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503003": "Well, are you afraid of dark and narrow spaces?",
  "str_quest_chat_25503004": "Uh... Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503005": "Maybe it's because I've spent so much time on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503006": "So, I'm used to that kind of environment.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503007": "Wow, PlayerName! Impressive!",
  "str_quest_chat_25503008": "But I often remember what happened to me when I was twelve.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503009": "I still feel scared even now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503010": "Do you think I'm weak?",
  "str_quest_chat_25503011": "No, I don't think you're weak.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503012": "Having fears doesn't make you weak.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503013": "R-Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_25503014": "Really! And remember when you protected those children...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25503015": "You were braver than anyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_25503016": "So, no, you're not weak.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503017": "Our fear is what causes us to grow.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503018": "Understood.",
  "str_quest_chat_25503019": "From today on, I'll continue doing my very best!",
  "str_quest_chat_25503020": "I must become... become an idol who never lets her fans down!",
  "str_quest_chat_25504001": "Hey, PlayerName? I... have a question for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25504002": "Huh? Sure, what is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_25504003": "How do you usually deal with your insomnia?",
  "str_quest_chat_25504004": "Have you tried doing some exercise before bed? Or maybe drinking a glass of warm milk?",
  "str_quest_chat_25504005": "B-But I've already tried those things.",
  "str_quest_chat_25504006": "Really? Now that I think about it... Is something keeping you awake at night, Goldie?",
  "str_quest_chat_25504007": "It sounds like something might be bothering you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25504008": "Ah... W-Well, there's one thing that's been bothering me lately...",
  "str_quest_chat_25504009": "Do you have some spare time, PlayerName? I really want to tell you about it in person!",
  "str_quest_chat_25504010": "Yeah, sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_25504011": "Okay! Can we meet on the Bridge, then?",
  "str_quest_chat_25504012": "Sounds good to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25504999": "Goldie is waiting for you on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_25541001": "This place is huge!",
  "str_quest_chat_25541002": "And the decor is so warm...",
  "str_quest_chat_25541003": "If I were to sing here, I bet it'd be a very moving performance, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25541004": "Can I perform here someday?",
  "str_quest_chat_25541005": "Of course, if that's what you want.",
  "str_quest_chat_25541006": "I don't have many friends...",
  "str_quest_chat_25541007": "So, whenever I think about becoming good friends with you, PlayerName—",
  "str_quest_chat_25541008": "Nothing would make me happier, and nothing would make Marshmallow happier, either!",
  "str_quest_chat_25541009": "I want to become good friends with you too.",
  "str_quest_chat_25541010": "And I hope we will be very good friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_25541011": "Right!",
  "str_quest_chat_25541012": "Hey, PlayerName—how strong is this door?",
  "str_quest_chat_25541013": "I think it should be pretty strong. I mean... how strong do you need it to be?",
  "str_quest_chat_25541014": "Do you reckon it could stop crazed fans from breaking in here, for example?",
  "str_quest_chat_25541015": "Um...",
  "str_quest_chat_25541016": "I'll reinforce it tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_25542001": "I think I can see it!",
  "str_quest_chat_25542002": "What can you see?",
  "str_quest_chat_25542003": "I can see the notes flowing from the instruments!",
  "str_quest_chat_25542004": "I can also hear the melody I'm singing reverberating around the room!",
  "str_quest_chat_25542005": "I feel like I can sing at a higher tone!",
  "str_quest_chat_25542006": "It sounds like you've made a lot of progress!",
  "str_quest_chat_25542007": "Marshmallow has leveled up too!",
  "str_quest_chat_25542008": "Huh? Marshmallow too?",
  "str_quest_chat_25542009": "That's right! Marshmallow's going to eat an extra bowl of rice now!",
  "str_quest_chat_25542010": "And its voice has become even louder!",
  "str_quest_chat_25542011": "Listen... Do you hear that?",
  "str_quest_chat_25542012": "I seriously doubt I can hear it from here.",
  "str_quest_chat_25542013": "That's not good enough for Marshmallow! It says it'll show you next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25542014": "Tell Marshmallow for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25542015": "Next time, I'll bring it some marshmallows to eat.",

  "str_quest_chat_25561011": "Oh, your reasoning was based on logical deduction after all—",

  "str_quest_chat_25563004": "I have a little bit of free time right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25563005": "I don't know why, but I have a slight stomachache...",
  "str_quest_chat_25563006": "Perhaps you ate something that didn't agree with you...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25563007": "No, I don't think it was something I ate...",
  "str_quest_chat_25563008": "After all, I haven't even eaten anything today.",
  "str_quest_chat_25563009": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_25563010": "I'm gonna take a guess and say your stomachache is the result of starving yourself...",

  "str_quest_chat_25563015": "If I fall ill, there'll be nobody to take care of Marshmallow!",
  "str_quest_chat_25563016": "Alright, it's time to pluck up and go for lunch!",
  "str_quest_chat_25563017": "I feel like Goldie's infectious positivity got the better of me once again...",
  "str_quest_chat_25581001": "Hey, good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25581002": "Phew, I finally finished my training for today.",
  "str_quest_chat_25581003": "Good job, Goldie.",
  "str_quest_chat_25581004": "Are you heading back to your room now?",
  "str_quest_chat_25581005": "I have a signing event to attend now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25581006": "My fans are waiting for me. Would you like to come, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25581007": "I need some rest. I'll take a rain check this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25581008": "No problem. After all, it was a somewhat sudden invitation.",
  "str_quest_chat_25581009": "I'd love to. Where's the signing taking place?",
  "str_quest_chat_25581010": "Oh, it just occurred to me that this signing might be a little out of your way.",
  "str_quest_chat_25581011": "Perhaps now is not the best time...",
  "str_quest_chat_25581012": "That's okay. Well then, Goldie—go get 'em!",
  "str_quest_chat_25581013": "Got it! Today, I'm gonna be the best idol I can be!",
  "str_quest_chat_25582001": "It's getting late... The sun's going down already.",
  "str_quest_chat_25582002": "PlayerName, are you going to bed already?",
  "str_quest_chat_25582003": "Not yet. You?",
  "str_quest_chat_25582004": "I still have a whole lot of energy to burn!",
  "str_quest_chat_25582005": "I'm going to have a rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_25582006": "Oh... Am I bothering you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25582007": "Not at all. I never feel sleepy when I have good company.",
  "str_quest_chat_25582008": "The starry sky looks so beautiful today.",
  "str_quest_chat_25582009": "It reminds me of all those people separated by insurmountable distances.",
  "str_quest_chat_25582010": "And how they can at least be together under the same starry sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_25582011": "When you're on the stage, Goldie, you're the brightest star there is.",
  "str_quest_chat_25582012": "All of your fans beneath this same starry sky will always support you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25582013": "Yeah!",
  "str_quest_chat_25582014": "And with your support, I can go beyond the stars!",
  "str_quest_chat_25583001": "Good evening, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_25583002": "Good evening, Goldie. What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_25583003": "I'm always busy, even at night!",
  "str_quest_chat_25583004": "I'm patrolling the streets for suspicious criminals...",
  "str_quest_chat_25583005": "Aren't you afraid of being recognized by your fans?",
  "str_quest_chat_25583006": "Nope, because I'm going to wrap myself up from head to toe—",
  "str_quest_chat_25583007": "There's no way anyone will recognize me!",
  "str_quest_chat_25583008": "There's no stopping you, Goldie.",
  "str_quest_chat_25583009": "Ladies and gentlemen, for this esteemed idol with a tireless sense of justice—",
  "str_quest_chat_25583010": "A round of applause, please!",
  "str_quest_chat_25583011": "Ahem... Oh, thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_25601001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_25601002": "I've been thinking.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601003": "I can't go on living on the Colossus like this, mooching food and board day after day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601004": "It must be a real hassle for you too.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601005": "So, I'd like to invite you to stay with me for a few days.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601006": "If you don't mind, that is.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601007": "Huh? Why are you being so polite all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_25601008": "It feels odd...",
  "str_quest_chat_25601009": "If you say so...",
  "str_quest_chat_25601010": "The only thing is, I might not have enough food.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601011": "You know my situation—things are tough out in the wilderness.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601012": "You might want to prepare your own supplies.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601013": "That won't be a problem.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601014": "And we won't be able to boil hot water.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601015": "I usually just use cold water to wash.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601016": "I'm afraid you might not get used to it and will catch a cold.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601017": "Why don't you build a water heater?",
  "str_quest_chat_25601018": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_25601019": "Also, I think the bar just stocked up on drinks a few days ago.",
  "str_quest_chat_25601020": "Can we...",
  "str_quest_chat_25601021": "Dream on!",
  "str_quest_chat_25602001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_25602002": "I feel like a lot of people on the Colossus are getting annoyed with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602003": "I know it hasn't been easy for you, having to help me deal with this kind of thing all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602004": "So, I've sent you a package as a thank-you gift.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602005": "You mean those two tightly-wrapped cans?",
  "str_quest_chat_25602006": "Yep, that's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602007": "I noticed that you've been exercising a lot recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602008": "That's why I sent you two cans of protein powder.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602009": "This is suspiciously generous of you...",
  "str_quest_chat_25602010": "You're actually behaving normally for once.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602011": "If you say so.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602012": "I just really wanted to express my gratitude.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602013": "I see. Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602014": "... Vic!",
  "str_quest_chat_25602015": "What's this you sent me!?",
  "str_quest_chat_25602016": "Huh? Protein powder...",
  "str_quest_chat_25602017": "Stag beetles are chock-full of protein.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602018": "I spent ages scouring the woods for them.",
  "str_quest_chat_25602019": "But you'll have to do the grinding yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_25603001": "Where are you, Vic?",
  "str_quest_chat_25603002": "It's almost time to get going! Are you ready to leave yet?",

  "str_quest_chat_25641007": "This is my first time using the terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat_25641008": "I'm too old for all these newfangled things you young people are into.",
  "str_quest_chat_25641009": "But Fia taught me how to use it just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25641010": "I'll be sure to contact you often, from now on.",
  "str_quest_chat_25641011": "O... Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_25642001": "Vic, have you received the book I sent you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25642002": "Book?",
  "str_quest_chat_25642003": "This \"Healthcare Secrets for Senior Citizens\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_25642004": "And \"Forever Active, Forever Young\"...? You're the one who sent me these?",
  "str_quest_chat_25642005": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_25642006": "I saw that you've just been getting drunk on the Colossus every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25642007": "Your work and sleep patterns are all over the place, and you never get any exercise.",
  "str_quest_chat_25642008": "I haven't seen you go outdoors in over ten days!",
  "str_quest_chat_25642009": "I think you should pay more attention to your health.",
  "str_quest_chat_25642010": "I read that the longer you go without exercise, the higher your chances of falling ill!",
  "str_quest_chat_25642011": "You really care about me, don't you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25642012": "It's so touching... You're the complete opposite of those two rapscallions.",
  "str_quest_chat_25642013": "All they would do was bully me every day... Boo-hoo...",
  "str_quest_chat_25642014": "I understand. In order to avoid worrying you—",
  "str_quest_chat_25642015": "I'll start exercising—from today onward!",
  "str_quest_chat_25642016": "First, I'll start by running to town for a drink.",
  "str_quest_chat_25642017": "Huh? What!? Wait a minute!",
  "str_quest_chat_25643001": "PlayerName.",

  "str_quest_chat_25643004": "Are you planning on making me clean up another mess for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25643005": "How could you say such a thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_25643006": "You and Fia are more and more alike each day... It's such a tragedy.",
  "str_quest_chat_25643007": "I'm starting to think that you just have this effect on people.",
  "str_quest_chat_25643008": "No, I have to change your image of me in your heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_25643009": "They're holding a press conference for my new book the day after tomorrow in Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_25643010": "I'd like you to be there as my guest of honor.",

  "str_quest_chat_25661011": "You're going to have to wait a couple of months.",
  "str_quest_chat_25662001": "Vic! There are loads of wondrous beasts walking around on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_25662002": "What's going on here? Did you forget to close your door?",
  "str_quest_chat_25662003": "Huh? No, I didn't.",
  "str_quest_chat_25662004": "It's just time for walkies.",
  "str_quest_chat_25662005": "I have to let them out to play and bask in the sun.",
  "str_quest_chat_25662006": "But they're disturbing the other Aurorians!",
  "str_quest_chat_25662007": "Someone was hypnotized by your Lutumi Owl just now!",
  "str_quest_chat_25662008": "I saw it steal their jewelry, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_25662009": "Oh! Well, that is what Lutumi Owls do best, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_25662010": "I'll make sure it finds its way to lost and found later.",
  "str_quest_chat_25662011": "If that's all, I'll go ahead and take a nap...",
  "str_quest_chat_25662012": "Hold on, Vic! Don't go to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_25662013": "Take all the animals back to your room with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_25681001": "PlayerName... Help me...",
  "str_quest_chat_25681002": "What's wrong, Vic?",
  "str_quest_chat_25681003": "Where are you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25681004": "I'm in my room...",
  "str_quest_chat_25681005": "I'm heading over now. What happened?",
  "str_quest_chat_25681006": "I...",
  "str_quest_chat_25681007": "I'm so hungry...",
  "str_quest_chat_25681008": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_25681009": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_25681010": "I drank too much yesterday afternoon... I've only just woken up.",
  "str_quest_chat_25681011": "Can you send me something to eat?",
  "str_quest_chat_25681012": "I'm starving to death here.",
  "str_quest_chat_25681013": "Glad to hear it. Goodnight.",
  "str_quest_chat_25681014": "... Go to the kitchen yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_25682001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_25682002": "Want to hear some of my bedtime grooming tips?",
  "str_quest_chat_25682003": "Huh? Not really...",
  "str_quest_chat_25682004": "Don't lie, you always seem so concerned with my age.",
  "str_quest_chat_25682005": "You want to ask how I manage to look so young and handsome, don't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25682006": "... No.",
  "str_quest_chat_25682007": "Now's your chance to find out.",
  "str_quest_chat_25682008": "You too, can know the secret of eternal youth.",
  "str_quest_chat_25682009": "As long as you help me purify the Neon Toad's mucus.",
  "str_quest_chat_25682010": "That's okay. You can give this opportunity to someone else.",
  "str_quest_chat_25683001": "Are you asleep, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25683002": "Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_25683003": "Are you sleeping?",
  "str_quest_chat_25683004": "... I'm sleeping.",
  "str_quest_chat_25683005": "Hehe... Clearly you're still awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_25683006": "You woke me up when you text-bombed me just now!",
  "str_quest_chat_25683007": "What's the matter with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25683008": "Don't be so impatient, kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_25683009": "Right now is when the Bouncybound is at its most active.",
  "str_quest_chat_25683010": "Interested in coming to observe it with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_25683011": "Huh? Then I'm interested!",
  "str_quest_chat_25683012": "That's great!",
  "str_quest_chat_25683013": "... Why do I feel like you always have an ulterior motive?",
  "str_quest_chat_25683014": "How can you say that?",
  "str_quest_chat_25683015": "Let's get going!",
  "str_quest_chat_25683016": "Set the Colossus' course for Rediesel Desert!",
  "str_quest_chat_25683017": "So, that's what you're up to!",
  "str_quest_chat_25701001": "PlayerName, what's your schedule looking like these days? Do you have any free time?",
  "str_quest_chat_25701002": "Sure. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_25701003": "I'd like to carry out an exclusive interview with you. You simply have to say yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_25701004": "You want to find out more about the Caelestites?",
  "str_quest_chat_25701005": "I was thinking about that, but... I'm more interested in knowing more about you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25701006": "You want to know more about me?",
  "str_quest_chat_25701007": "That's right. You're one of Astra's most famous individuals.",
  "str_quest_chat_25701008": "For example, what are your hobbies, is there anyone you like right now...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25701009": "Why does it feel like you're sniffing around for gossip?",
  "str_quest_chat_25701010": "That's not it! What do you mean? When did you become so cynical?",
  "str_quest_chat_25701011": "It's probably all because of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25701012": "Really...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25701013": "No, this won't do at all... I'm not ready yet—let's put this exclusive interview on hold for now!",
  "str_quest_chat_25702001": "Is there anything left to eat on the Colossus, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25702002": "Anything will do... Even leftovers...",
  "str_quest_chat_25702003": "Huh? Yeah, we've got plenty to eat, but is something the matter, Brandy?",
  "str_quest_chat_25702004": "I haven't eaten in three days... I'm about to pass out...",
  "str_quest_chat_25702005": "!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_25702006": "Just hang on! I'll bring you something right away!",
  "str_quest_chat_25702007": "Okay, then... I'll be waiting in the Cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_25702999": "Hurry over to the Cafe and bring Brandy something to eat!",
  "str_quest_chat_25741001": "PlayerName, I'm about to write a news story that will change the world!",
  "str_quest_chat_25741002": "After going deep undercover for months, my informant finally came up with the goods!",
  "str_quest_chat_25741003": "This feeling... This is so exciting!",
  "str_quest_chat_25741004": "Congratulations, Brandy!",
  "str_quest_chat_25741005": "Thank you! Well, I should say... it's all thanks to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25741006": "Me?",
  "str_quest_chat_25741007": "Since I became friends with you, you've really broadened my horizons.",
  "str_quest_chat_25741008": "It's because of you that I can now reach heights as great as this...",
  "str_quest_chat_25741009": "You're flattering me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25741010": "It's not flattery.",
  "str_quest_chat_25741011": "Don't you know me by now? I never say anything unless I mean it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25741012": "Alright, alright—I still have a lot of work to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_25741013": "Let's save the praise until the article is actually published.",
  "str_quest_chat_25741014": "Then we can celebrate.",
  "str_quest_chat_25742001": "Sorry, I got a little injured during an interview today, so I can't do my cooking shift.",
  "str_quest_chat_25742002": "You're injured!? Are you okay!?",
  "str_quest_chat_25742003": "I'm fine. A minor injury like this is merely a badge of honor for a reporter.",
  "str_quest_chat_25742004": "Don't push yourself too hard...",
  "str_quest_chat_25742005": "Finding the path to the truth is never easy, and there are no shortcuts.",
  "str_quest_chat_25742006": "But thank you for your concern.",
  "str_quest_chat_25742007": "You're so strong.",
  "str_quest_chat_25742008": "Hehe, it is also a part of professional journalists' constitution to be brave in the face of difficulty and danger.",
  "str_quest_chat_25742009": "I have always believed that being true has the power to change people's destinies.",
  "str_quest_chat_25742010": "PlayerName, along this journey I've embarked on with you, I've realized this all the more clearly.",
  "str_quest_chat_25742011": "So, in order to do justice to our journey, I will also strengthen my ambition.",
  "str_quest_chat_25751001": "Morning, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_25751002": "Can you help me deliver today's newspaper to the office?",
  "str_quest_chat_25751003": "I'm too busy with writing to do it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_25751004": "Wait, I just got up...",
  "str_quest_chat_25751005": "You just got up? I see. The decadent private life of the Caelestites! What a scoop!",
  "str_quest_chat_25751006": "Wait! Don't write that down!",
  "str_quest_chat_25751007": "Well... You certainly are a hard worker, Brandy.",
  "str_quest_chat_25751008": "I'd rather not sleep, if I could... It's such a waste of time!",
  "str_quest_chat_25751009": "After all, the news waits for no Aurorian!",
  "str_quest_chat_25751010": "But I'm sorry for the hassle the newspaper is causing you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25751011": "I understand... I'll pick up a coffee for you on the way.",
  "str_quest_chat_25751012": "Thanks! Hey, I should be the one treating you!",
  "str_quest_chat_25752001": "PlayerName, can you tell me what that paste they served for breakfast today was?",
  "str_quest_chat_25752002": "It's a kind of nutritional supplement cream—a type of food produced by the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_25752003": "So you think there's nothing wrong with eating strange food like this?",
  "str_quest_chat_25752004": "Right.",
  "str_quest_chat_25752005": "Interesting. It seems that the Caelestites have a different sense of taste from ours.",
  "str_quest_chat_25752006": "I'm actually really sick of eating it all the time...",
  "str_quest_chat_25752007": "But you're still feeding it to us...",
  "str_quest_chat_25752008": "I'm not doing it out of spite! Sometimes everyone is just too lazy to cook.",
  "str_quest_chat_25752009": "Oh... Alright, then. I'll cook something else for you next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_25752010": "Heheh... Well, until then.",
  "str_quest_chat_25761001": "Good afternoon. It's so sunny on the bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_25761002": "Not writing today, Brandy? Are you looking for material on the bridge?",
  "str_quest_chat_25761003": "No, I'm just trying out my new sunglasses.",
  "str_quest_chat_25761004": "Oh, right. Your sunglasses collection.",
  "str_quest_chat_25761005": "Speaking of which, what do you think of my star sunglasses?",
  "str_quest_chat_25761006": "They're cool!",
  "str_quest_chat_25761007": "It seems there's a high degree of acceptance for unconventional styles among the Caelestites...",
  "str_quest_chat_25761008": "They're kind of strange...",
  "str_quest_chat_25761009": "Hmm... Are they really so strange?",
  "str_quest_chat_25761010": "I bought a new pair of sunglasses with star-shaped frames.",
  "str_quest_chat_25761011": "When I came to the bridge to try them on, everyone kept staring at me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25761012": "Novelties like this always grab people's attention.",
  "str_quest_chat_25762001": "PlayerName, have you seen Shadow?",
  "str_quest_chat_25762002": "Shadow? I think it ran to the kitchen.",
  "str_quest_chat_25762003": "The kitchen... How peculiar...",
  "str_quest_chat_25762004": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat_25762005": "Haven't you seen it? Interesting...",
  "str_quest_chat_25762006": "What do you want with Shadow?",
  "str_quest_chat_25762007": "Shadow has been quite dissatisfied with its wages recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_25762008": "You usually put away your ingredients after using them, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25762009": "I have a bad feeling about this...",
  "str_quest_chat_25781001": "Good evening, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_25781002": "I'm at a press conference right now, waiting around on standby.",
  "str_quest_chat_25781003": "I just wanted to share my excitement with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_25781004": "Press conference...? What time is it!?",
  "str_quest_chat_25781005": "The more exciting the news, the more likely it is to happen in the dead of night!",
  "str_quest_chat_25781006": "You're really committed to your work, Brandy.",
  "str_quest_chat_25781007": "What else do you expect from a journalist?",
  "str_quest_chat_25781008": "Plus, there's the fact that I haven't been made a staffer yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_25781009": "A journalist's life isn't easy.",
  "str_quest_chat_25781010": "Hehe, you finally understand just how amazing journalists are, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_25781011": "The press conference is about to start. Let's talk later.",
  "str_quest_chat_25782001": "PlayerName, I'm facing the biggest crisis of my life...",
  "str_quest_chat_25782002": "I can't finish the story I'm working on, and the deadline is today!",
  "str_quest_chat_25782003": "You can't meet your deadline... again?",
  "str_quest_chat_25782004": "Good news stories need the pressure of a deadline to fuel them!",
  "str_quest_chat_25782005": "Are you going to apply for an extension?",
  "str_quest_chat_25782006": "No way.",
  "str_quest_chat_25782007": "There's no place for old news in this world—a story should never be delayed!",
  "str_quest_chat_25782008": "This is no time for idle chitchat—I need to concentrate on writing!",
  "str_quest_chat_25782009": "Right... Maybe you shouldn't be messaging me when you have so much work to do...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25801001": "What's your plan for today, my young friend?",
  "str_quest_chat_25801002": "I'm going for a run later today!",
  "str_quest_chat_25801003": "Aside from that... Nothing really, to be honest.",
  "str_quest_chat_25801004": "Ah, exercise... A wise choice.",
  "str_quest_chat_25801005": "And how many kilometers do you intend to run?",
  "str_quest_chat_25801006": "Not sure... Maybe three?",
  "str_quest_chat_25801007": "In the land of Longzhou, soldiers are required to run at least twenty kilometers every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25801008": "T-Twenty kilometers?!",
  "str_quest_chat_25801009": "Hey, Zhong Xu? I have a question...",
  "str_quest_chat_25801010": "Speak freely, my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_25801011": "Was it hard being a soldier under your command?",
  "str_quest_chat_25801012": "An interesting question... I don't seem to recall any complaints, now that I think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25801013": "Did you ever think that maybe your soldiers were too scared to tell you...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25802001": "I recently produced a new batch of porcelain wares.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802002": "A pity that I'm still unable to replicate the quality of Longzhou's greatest craftsmen.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802003": "Hmm... I'm sure the artisans of Longzhou all have their own secret techniques when it comes to their craft.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802004": "That's probably how they manage to stay in business for so long.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802005": "Indeed, they do. It seems you're quite knowledgeable when it comes to tricks of the trade, my young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802006": "To preserve their craft, these unique trade secrets are known only to the masters who discover them, and the apprentices under their guidance.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802007": "But not just any apprentice will do, you know... Only a certain kind of apprentice is worthy of inheriting their master's art.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802008": "The most obedient apprentice, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25802009": "The most skilled apprentice, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25802010": "Both skill and obedience are required, but these are not the most important qualities in an apprentice.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802011": "The most important quality... is loyalty.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802012": "Only a loyal apprentice can guarantee the secrecy of their master's art, and ensure that it withstands the test of time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802013": "I see... So where'd you learn how to make porcelain, Zhong Xu?",
  "str_quest_chat_25802014": "Oh, I just learned a few things from one of the Longzhou masters back when I had nothing else to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802015": "Oh? When you put it that way...",
  "str_quest_chat_25802016": "It sounds like your master didn't teach you everything they knew, which means...",
  "str_quest_chat_25802017": "Ahem! It was just a hobby for me at the time, I'll have you know.",
  "str_quest_chat_25802018": "Now if you will excuse me, I must go check on my porcelain...",
  "str_quest_chat_25803001": "I've been thinking about my youth lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803002": "As a child, my father was very strict with me. My days were filled with endless studying and bitter training...",
  "str_quest_chat_25803003": "I believe I was roughly your age at the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803004": "Really? Then I probably wasn't even born yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803005": "Time has gone by so quickly... Without realizing it, I've already reached my forties.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803006": "Now that I'm so far from home... I can hardly remember what it felt like to be young.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803007": "Tell me, young friend... When you reflect on the past, what do you think about most?",
  "str_quest_chat_25803008": "I think about the battle I've fought.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803009": "I think about the people I've met.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803010": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803011": "You've experienced much in life for someone so young.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803012": "Of all the friends I've made, you're one of the most unique.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803013": "You're pretty special yourself, Zhong Xu.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803014": "You truly think so?",
  "str_quest_chat_25803015": "Of course I do! After all...",
  "str_quest_chat_25803016": "You really know how to fight!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_25803017": "Like when you sent an Eclipsite flying through the air with just one finger!",
  "str_quest_chat_25803018": "Or how you challenged all those people by yourself while in sitting in a wheelchair!",
  "str_quest_chat_25803019": "Hmph. Back when I was in the military, even a hundred enemies were no match for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25803020": "Oh! S-Sorry... Did I say something that upset you?",
  "str_quest_chat_25803021": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_25803022": "I, uh... I should get going...",
  "str_quest_chat_25841001": "In my travels throughout Longzhou, I've made a number of friends... Though that number is still quite small.",
  "str_quest_chat_25841002": "To fight at your side brings me much joy, my young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_25841003": "I'm thankful to be friends with you too, Zhong Xu!",
  "str_quest_chat_25841004": "A soldier for the first half of my life, and a wanderer for the latter half... I truly believe that everything in my life has been decided by destiny.",
  "str_quest_chat_25841005": "If it weren't for this, I never would have met you or this magnificent being you call Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_25841006": "Then from now on, you'll always have a home here on Soroz!",
  "str_quest_chat_25841007": "If you ever want to visit, the door is always open!",
  "str_quest_chat_25841008": "Hahaha! How could I turn down such a warm and generous offer? Thank you, my young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_25842001": "I've been feeling quite reinvigorated lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_25842002": "It seems my strength has reached new heights yet again.",
  "str_quest_chat_25842003": "Care to do some exercise with me, my young friend?",
  "str_quest_chat_25842004": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_25842005": "But let's just try to keep it within reason, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_25842006": "I think I'll pass.",
  "str_quest_chat_25842007": "If you feel that energetic, I'm worried I won't make it through one of your workouts...",
  "str_quest_chat_25842008": "There's nothing to worry about, young friend. I promise not to get carried away.",
  "str_quest_chat_25842009": "The most important part of strength training is gradual, measured progress.",
  "str_quest_chat_25842010": "Let's begin by testing your arm strength. Are there any rocks nearby?",
  "str_quest_chat_25842011": "Yeah.",
  "str_quest_chat_25842012": "Start by picking up a rock that is roughly as wide as your arm's length.",
  "str_quest_chat_25842013": "Argh—",
  "str_quest_chat_25842014": "It's... It's up! Now what?",
  "str_quest_chat_25842015": "Good. Now place it on the table.",
  "str_quest_chat_25842016": "Urgh... There! Phew...",
  "str_quest_chat_25842017": "And now smash it with one punch.",
  "str_quest_chat_25842018": "Sure, I'll just smash it with...",
  "str_quest_chat_25842019": "... one punch?! Is that even possible? What happened to \"gradual, measured progress\"?!",
  "str_quest_chat_25842020": "I see... It appears this test is still too difficult for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25843001": "I can feel a great power coursing through my veins.",
  "str_quest_chat_25843002": "I believe my Flame Force Arts has reached the next level.",
  "str_quest_chat_25843003": "Really? Does that mean you can make your fireballs even bigger now, Zhong Xu?",
  "str_quest_chat_25843004": "Not only that... I can control them even better now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25843005": "Interesting... Think I could ask you for a favor?",
  "str_quest_chat_25843006": "By all means.",
  "str_quest_chat_25843007": "I want to do an open-air barbecue with these ingredients... Do you think you can help me with the fire?",
  "str_quest_chat_25843008": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_25843009": "An odd request, I must admit.",
  "str_quest_chat_25843010": "It's just that the oven is so small... But I think your flames should be perfect for the job!",
  "str_quest_chat_25843011": "Despite my control over fire, there's always a chance that the intensity of my flames will burn the food.",
  "str_quest_chat_25843012": "Yeah, you have a point, Zhong Xu.",
  "str_quest_chat_25843013": "I just thought the kitties might want some roasted meat, is all—",
  "str_quest_chat_25843014": "But I guess using your flame to cook food is kind of overkill.",
  "str_quest_chat_25843015": "I see... Well, if it's for the kittens, I may need to reconsider...",
  "str_quest_chat_25844001": "The flames in my hands burn brighter than ever before.",
  "str_quest_chat_25844002": "This flashing, crimson fire... What an immense power!",
  "str_quest_chat_25844003": "Let my flames reduce all to cinders!",
  "str_quest_chat_25844004": "Looks like your flames have gotten even more powerful, Zhong Xu!",
  "str_quest_chat_25844005": "I haven't felt this kind of sensation in ages.",
  "str_quest_chat_25844006": "In the past, this very same fire claimed the lives of countless enemies on the battlefield.",
  "str_quest_chat_25844007": "Seeing it burn so brightly once again... I cannot help but want to unleash it once more.",
  "str_quest_chat_25844008": "J-Just remember to do it somewhere nice and open... And be careful!",
  "str_quest_chat_25844009": "No, no, that won't do... I need a target in order to unleash my full power.",
  "str_quest_chat_25844010": "I see... Why not test it out on some of the ruins nearby?",
  "str_quest_chat_25844011": "Now that you mention it, I do recall seeing a number of ruins in the area. I think I'll do just that!",
  "str_quest_chat_25844012": "Sure, but try to pick a good target, preferably one that won't explode and send debris flying everywhere.",
  "str_quest_chat_25844013": "And remember to make sure no one is close enough to your flames to get hurt!",
  "str_quest_chat_25844014": "I would never do anything so careless. Now then, I'm off to find a suitable location.",
  "str_quest_chat_25844015": "Well? Did you try out your new powers? How did it go?",
  "str_quest_chat_25844016": "It went quite well, actually. I managed to reduce an entire set of ruins to a pile of rubble.",
  "str_quest_chat_25844017": "Oh! H-How nice! (Jeez, that's some serious firepower...)",
  "str_quest_chat_25851001": "The light of dawn begins to shine.",
  "str_quest_chat_25851002": "A new day is upon us.",
  "str_quest_chat_25851003": "Good morning, Zhong Xu!",
  "str_quest_chat_25851004": "You're up early, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_25851005": "Just an old habit from my military days, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat_25851006": "Back then, our training began even before the sun was out.",
  "str_quest_chat_25851007": "After so many years of living like that, the habit has not left me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25851008": "Hey, Zhong Xu? Do you think I have what it takes to go through that kind of training?",
  "str_quest_chat_25851009": "Hmm, let me see...",
  "str_quest_chat_25851010": "Why don't we meet for some morning exercises and see for ourselves?",
  "str_quest_chat_25851011": "Er... Forget I said anything. I think I'd rather just sleep in today...",
  "str_quest_chat_25852001": "Good morning, my young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_25852002": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_25852003": "An early start and the morning air are the keys to improving one's skills.",
  "str_quest_chat_25852004": "Is that some sort of secret Longzhou wisdom?",
  "str_quest_chat_25852005": "Heheheh, not at all. This is just how I normally begin my day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25852006": "First, I wake up early. Then, I take a deep breath of the fresh, morning air.",
  "str_quest_chat_25852007": "Then, I focus on something and let the coolness of the morning sharpen my senses.",
  "str_quest_chat_25852008": "Phew... It's not as easy as you make it sound...",
  "str_quest_chat_25861001": "This is the time of day when the sun shines brightest.",
  "str_quest_chat_25861002": "How is the sunshine where you are, young friend?",
  "str_quest_chat_25861003": "Bright as ever! Today's another beautiful day!",
  "str_quest_chat_25861004": "I see... Unfortunately, the weather is quite overcast where I am...",
  "str_quest_chat_25861005": "So what do you usually do when the weather is sunny, Zhong Xu?",
  "str_quest_chat_25861006": "I like to let the cats out to sunbathe.",
  "str_quest_chat_25861007": "They are all quite fond of fair weather.",
  "str_quest_chat_25861008": "Wow, that sounds so peaceful...",
  "str_quest_chat_25861009": "Perhaps we all need days like this, even the cats.",
  "str_quest_chat_25861010": "After all, there are many ways to live one's life, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25861011": "That's right!",
  "str_quest_chat_25861012": "Huh, I wasn't expecting to have such a thoughtful conversation this afternoon...",
  "str_quest_chat_25862001": "Good afternoon, my young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_25862002": "Have you eaten lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_25862003": "Yep!",
  "str_quest_chat_25862004": "I had a vegan salad today.",
  "str_quest_chat_25862005": "That sounds awfully dreary... Are you on a diet, by chance?",
  "str_quest_chat_25862006": "N-No, it's just a normal meal for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25862007": "In Longzhou, our lunches consist of at least three dishes and a soup.",
  "str_quest_chat_25862008": "However, I'm not fond of wasting food... So I make do with just two dishes and soup.",
  "str_quest_chat_25862009": "That still sounds like a really big meal to me!!",
  "str_quest_chat_25862010": "Is that so? Perhaps I should consider eating less, as well...",
  "str_quest_chat_25863001": "Afternoon already? My, how time flies...",
  "str_quest_chat_25863002": "Have you been busy today, my young friend?",
  "str_quest_chat_25863003": "Very busy!",
  "str_quest_chat_25863004": "Yeah, I've been getting ready for our annual spring cleaning.",
  "str_quest_chat_25863005": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_25863006": "I just finished cleaning my room, so I was going to take a break for a while.",
  "str_quest_chat_25863007": "Very good. After all, a clean home is a happy home.",
  "str_quest_chat_25863008": "So you must really like spring cleaning, right Zhong Xu?",
  "str_quest_chat_25863009": "Not necessarily. We simply have a certain tradition regarding spring cleaning in Longzhou.",
  "str_quest_chat_25863010": "By sweeping away the filth of the past, we invite happiness and good fortune in our future.",
  "str_quest_chat_25863011": "That makes sense! I should do the same too!",
  "str_quest_chat_25863012": "I'll give the entire place an entirely new look, and sweep away any bad luck hiding out here!",
  "str_quest_chat_25864001": "The day is still young, but the sky has been obscured by dark clouds...",
  "str_quest_chat_25864002": "It seems my plans have been foiled by poor weather yet again.",
  "str_quest_chat_25864003": "This kind of weather is perfect for relaxing at home.",
  "str_quest_chat_25864004": "Unless... Did you have plans to go somewhere, Zhong Xu?",
  "str_quest_chat_25864005": "I wanted to go shopping for some new reading material... But it appears today is out of the question.",
  "str_quest_chat_25864006": "My wheelchair does not move well in the rain.",
  "str_quest_chat_25864007": "That makes sense. Plus, I'm sure your wheelchair was really expensive.",
  "str_quest_chat_25864008": "If you got stuck in the mud somewhere... It'd be really hard to clean it afterward!",
  "str_quest_chat_25864009": "PlayerName... Your way of thinking is interesting, to say the least.",
  "str_quest_chat_25864010": "Heheheh... Anyways, you can always go when the weather clears up!",
  "str_quest_chat_25864011": "Indeed. There is always another day!",
  "str_quest_chat_25881001": "It's very late, young friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_25881002": "No kidding... It's completely dark outside! I should call it a day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25881003": "In Longzhou, we hang paper lanterns at night to illuminate our surroundings...",
  "str_quest_chat_25881004": "Sounds like you're feeling a little homesick, Zhong Xu.",
  "str_quest_chat_25881005": "Not especially. I just find it somewhat sad... Such beautiful objects are doomed to obscurity in the face of modern technology.",
  "str_quest_chat_25881006": "In any case, you should go to bed soon. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_25881007": "Sure! Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_25882001": "Have you gone to bed yet, young friend?",
  "str_quest_chat_25882002": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_25882003": "Just got in bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_25882004": "Why are you still awake, Zhong Xu?",
  "str_quest_chat_25882005": "Despite how late it is... I hardly feel like sleeping at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_25882006": "You have trouble sleeping too?",
  "str_quest_chat_25882007": "Are you sure you're not just hungry?",
  "str_quest_chat_25882008": "Now that you mention it, I did skip my supper today... Perhaps I'm feeling a bit peckish after all?",
  "str_quest_chat_25882009": "But how did you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_25882010": "Well, they say the hungrier you are, the more awake you feel. I think I'm in the same boat too...",
  "str_quest_chat_25883001": "The kittens are always so much more playful at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_25883002": "I bet! Watching those three chase each other around the room must be lots of fun.",
  "str_quest_chat_25883003": "Do you have a way to calm them down, Zhong Xu?",
  "str_quest_chat_25883004": "Not at all. They are creatures of the night, after all. Who am I to interfere with their natural behavior?",
  "str_quest_chat_25883005": "Still, they hardly bother me when I go home to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_25883006": "On the contrary, Yimeng even curls up to sleep next to me. The other two are a bit more rambunctious, though...",
  "str_quest_chat_25883007": "Is Yimeng the one with the big, pretty eyes?",
  "str_quest_chat_25883008": "Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_25883009": "I see... I had no idea their personalities could be so different!",
  "str_quest_chat_25901001": "I left a bowl of river snail noodles at your door, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25901002": "Remember to eat them.",
  "str_quest_chat_25901003": "Thanks, Yuebai... But I'm not really hungry right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25901004": "There's this weird smell coming from somewhere in my room...",
  "str_quest_chat_25901005": "For some reason, I can't find the source of the stench!",
  "str_quest_chat_25901006": "It seems you've never eaten river snail noodles before... Otherwise, you wouldn't be so unappreciative of their distinct aroma.",
  "str_quest_chat_25901007": "Wait... \"River snail noodles\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_25901008": "Oh, I remember now!",
  "str_quest_chat_25901009": "That's your favorite food?",
  "str_quest_chat_25901010": "What exactly is that...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25901011": "It's my favorite kind of food.",
  "str_quest_chat_25901012": "S-So that smell... Is the smell of river snail noodles?",
  "str_quest_chat_25901013": "Correct.",
  "str_quest_chat_25901014": "I wanted to thank you for your hospitality these last few days.",
  "str_quest_chat_25901015": "So I thought I would share my favorite dish with you as a token of my gratitude.",
  "str_quest_chat_25901016": "I appreciate it!",
  "str_quest_chat_25901017": "... But I still think I should open a window... Or all of them.",
  "str_quest_chat_25902001": "Have you ever tried wood carving, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_25902002": "Nope.",
  "str_quest_chat_25902003": "I remember seeing lots of wood carvings all over Longzhou, though!",
  "str_quest_chat_25902004": "There were even a bunch of them on The Shadowind too.",
  "str_quest_chat_25902005": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_25902006": "Assuming a slingshot carved from a tree branch counts...",
  "str_quest_chat_25902007": "To tell the truth, I'm quite a skilled woodcarver.",
  "str_quest_chat_25902008": "If you're ever interested, we can work on something together?",
  "str_quest_chat_25902009": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_25902010": "When I was a child, my master personally taught me how to carve wood by hand.",
  "str_quest_chat_25902011": "Now, I'm even skilled enough to teach others like yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_25902012": "Wow, Mr. Lin must be really fond of you, Yuebai!",
  "str_quest_chat_25902013": "I wasn't so sure before, but now I think I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_25902014": "No one ever wishes to waste their time on someone they detest.",
  "str_quest_chat_25902015": "Thank you for helping me understand my master even more.",
  "str_quest_chat_25902016": "Huh? I-I didn't really do anything, though...",
  "str_quest_chat_25902017": "Also, you don't have to be so formal with me, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_25903001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_25903002": "Hmm? What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_25903003": "Um...",
  "str_quest_chat_25903004": "Never mind, I'm fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903005": "You can tell me if something's bothering you, Yuebai. We're all friends here, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903006": "It's just... I suddenly began to think about my father.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903007": "What's wrong with that? I think it's fine to think about your family every once in a while.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903008": "But he left my home many years ago... I haven't seen him ever since.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903009": "You don't want to go look for him?",
  "str_quest_chat_25903010": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903011": "Hmm... It sounds to me like you still want to see him, Yuebai.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903012": "You think so...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25903013": "I know your feelings towards your father are complicated, to say the least...",
  "str_quest_chat_25903014": "But I only ever see you hesitate or doubt yourself whenever he comes up in conversations.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903015": "Which is why I think you haven't let go of him yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903016": "... Perhaps you're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903017": "Very well. If I ever find my father's whereabouts, please go visit him for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_25903018": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_25903019": "We're friends, aren't we? And friends do favors for each other, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_25903020": "W-Well, yeah...",
  "str_quest_chat_25904001": "What do you think of this weapon? It's called a Ancestral Bone Dagger.",
  "str_quest_chat_25904002": "Ancestral Bone Dagger... Hey, isn't this the dagger you always carry at your side, Yuebai?",
  "str_quest_chat_25904003": "Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_25904004": "Hmm... I would say...",
  "str_quest_chat_25904005": "It's really beautiful!",
  "str_quest_chat_25904006": "Even though it's a weapon, I can't help but admire its beauty.",
  "str_quest_chat_25904007": "It's really sharp!",
  "str_quest_chat_25904008": "Even though it looks small, I bet that dagger is extremely lethal.",
  "str_quest_chat_25904009": "You have a very discerning eye, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25904010": "Tell me, do you know what this Ancestral Bone Dagger was made from?",
  "str_quest_chat_25904011": "No idea at all...",
  "str_quest_chat_25904012": "It was made from the tail of a living serpentfish, an ancestor of the Lin clan.",
  "str_quest_chat_25904013": "What?! Th-That sounds brutal...",
  "str_quest_chat_25904014": "I beg to differ. The ancestor in question was nearing the end of his life...",
  "str_quest_chat_25904015": "And so, in order to watch over his descendants, he ordered them to craft this Ancestral Bone Dagger out of his tail.",
  "str_quest_chat_25904016": "This dagger symbolizes the promise of protection for every descendant of the Lin clan who bears the tail of a serpentfish.",
  "str_quest_chat_25904017": "That means you too, right Yuebai?",
  "str_quest_chat_25904018": "That's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_25904019": "And when the day comes that I must leave this world... I also wish for a Frostbone Blade to be made from my own tail.",
  "str_quest_chat_25904020": "As it stands, I have no descendants... So perhaps I should pass it on to you, instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_25904021": "I'm honored by your offer, Yuebai...",
  "str_quest_chat_25904022": "But I really hope that day never comes!",
  "str_quest_chat_25905001": "PlayerName, last time, you said you wanted to see how cargo purchasing works.",
  "str_quest_chat_25905002": "Yeah. I always hear you talking about trading goods between Longzhou and Astra, so I'm a little curious.",
  "str_quest_chat_25905003": "I'm going to Twin Pavilions Bay's business district now. Would you like to come along?",
  "str_quest_chat_25905004": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_25905005": "I'll be waiting for you on the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_25905999": "Mu Yuebai is waiting for you on the bridge. Go and find her.",
  "str_quest_chat_25941001": "Greetings. I'm Yuebai, the new captain of The Shadowind.",
  "str_quest_chat_25941002": "You must be PlayerName, the captain of this Colossus. A pleasure to meet you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25941003": "If I hadn't seen them with my own eyes...",
  "str_quest_chat_25941004": "I would never have believed in the existence of a ship such as this, one that could sail through the heavens above.",
  "str_quest_chat_25941005": "It seems the rumors were true, all along.",
  "str_quest_chat_25941006": "Riding the wind across a sea of clouds, with nothing to reveal the course of your journeys...",
  "str_quest_chat_25941007": "A marvelous ship, indeed!",
  "str_quest_chat_25941008": "We appreciate the compliments, Yuebai.",
  "str_quest_chat_25941009": "But now that I've seen it for myself... Am I correct in assuming that your skyfaring vessel is not equipped to travel on the high seas?",
  "str_quest_chat_25941010": "That would be correct, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_25941011": "Then it seems The Shadowind is still the master of the seas!",
  "str_quest_chat_25941012": "Unless, of course, you disagree?",
  "str_quest_chat_25941013": "N-Not at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_25942001": "Thank you, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25942002": "Don't mention it, Yuebai! Er... What did I do again?",
  "str_quest_chat_25942003": "You allowed me to study Soroz and its designs, so I must thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25942004": "Oh, does that mean you've made a new discovery?",
  "str_quest_chat_25942005": "Not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_25942006": "After all, the ships in Longzhou are built very differently than on Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_25942007": "My research still has a long way to go...",
  "str_quest_chat_25942008": "But to be fair, I was never very hopeful to begin with.",
  "str_quest_chat_25942009": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_25942010": "There's no reason to blame yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_25942011": "You have many capable and trustworthy friends here, and I have learned much from them... And from you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25942012": "And for that, I must also thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_25942013": "D-Don't mention it...",
  "str_quest_chat_25943001": "The weather is good, perfect for sailing.",
  "str_quest_chat_25943002": "Yeah, but I thought The Shadowind was departing a few days later?",
  "str_quest_chat_25943003": "For all of your complaints, it seems your memory is perfectly fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_25943004": "I'll take that as a compliment...",
  "str_quest_chat_25943005": "True, today is not the day for me to set sail on The Shadowind...",
  "str_quest_chat_25943006": "But that doesn't mean my new model ship cannot depart on its maiden voyage!",
  "str_quest_chat_25943007": "\"Model ship\"...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25943008": "Indeed. I designed and crafted it during my stay on Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_25943009": "I even took inspiration from some of Soroz's unique characteristics when designing this model.",
  "str_quest_chat_25943010": "Originally, it was meant to be both a seafaring vessel as well as a skyfaring one.",
  "str_quest_chat_25943011": "But despite my best efforts, I could not make it fly...",
  "str_quest_chat_25943012": "And my precious model took a nosedive right into the ocean.",
  "str_quest_chat_25943013": "But as it began to take on water, I was suddenly struck by a brilliant idea!",
  "str_quest_chat_25943014": "What if I designed a vessel that could travel UNDER the water, rather than on top of it?",
  "str_quest_chat_25943015": "Hey, that sounds like a great idea!",
  "str_quest_chat_25943016": "Agreed, but I won't let my ideas stop there!",
  "str_quest_chat_25943017": "I must continue with my research! Full speed ahead!",
  "str_quest_chat_25943018": "Good luck, Yuebai!",
  "str_quest_chat_25951001": "I'm off to eat breakfast. Goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat_25951002": "Wait!",
  "str_quest_chat_25951003": "What is it? Would you like to join me?",
  "str_quest_chat_25951004": "Sure! I haven't eaten either, now that I think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25951005": "But it sounds like you want to go out to eat... Is that right, Yuebai?",
  "str_quest_chat_25951006": "Is it because you don't like the food we have on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_25951007": "Indeed.",
  "str_quest_chat_25951008": "Blunt as ever, I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_25951009": "However, the problem does not lie with you or your food.",
  "str_quest_chat_25951010": "Though I'm in Astra now, my heart and appetite will always yearn for Longzhou's delicious cuisine.",
  "str_quest_chat_25951011": "I see... Maybe we can find some Longzhou-style food in Umbraton?",
  "str_quest_chat_25951012": "Umbraton is home to a number of Longzhou-style restaurants, yes... But my favorite places can only be found in Twin Pavilions Bay.",
  "str_quest_chat_25951013": "Which is where I'm going for breakfast today.",
  "str_quest_chat_25951014": "Y-You're gonna travel that far just to eat breakfast?!",
  "str_quest_chat_25951015": "If the distance is too great for you, PlayerName, I can always go by myself?",
  "str_quest_chat_25951016": "Yeah, that's a little too far for me... But safe travels!",
  "str_quest_chat_25952001": "Are you awake yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_25952002": "Good morning, Yuebai.",
  "str_quest_chat_25952003": "It appears so.",
  "str_quest_chat_25952004": "Hurry up and get dressed.",
  "str_quest_chat_25952005": "Huh? Did something bad happen?",
  "str_quest_chat_25952006": "Not at all. I'm in a great mood today, and wish to play in the sea today.",
  "str_quest_chat_25952007": "B-But...",
  "str_quest_chat_25952008": "I still have to do my workout.",
  "str_quest_chat_25952009": "I still have work to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_25952010": "If you wish to refuse my offer, then just say so. There is no need to make excuses.",
  "str_quest_chat_25952011": "You're right, I'm sorry... The truth is, I still want to lay in bed for a while.",
  "str_quest_chat_25952012": "Then you should do just that. We can always visit the beach another day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25952013": "Wow, I had no idea you could be so accommodating, Yuebai!",
  "str_quest_chat_25952014": "Hmph... Was there ever any doubt?",
  "str_quest_chat_25952015": "Er, not at all, no...",
  "str_quest_chat_25953001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_25953002": "Good morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_25953003": "You woke up quite early today, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25953004": "Well, someone came to make a complaint this morning...",
  "str_quest_chat_25953005": "Apparently, they kept hearing a loud, grinding noise all morning, but they didn't know where it was coming from.",
  "str_quest_chat_25953006": "Did you happen to hear it too, Yuebai?",
  "str_quest_chat_25953007": "My apologies... I believe that was the sound of me sharpening my blade.",
  "str_quest_chat_25953008": "I will be more careful not to disturb others next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_25953009": "Sharpening your blade? Why were you doing that so early in the morning?",
  "str_quest_chat_25953010": "Because I had the urge, obviously...",
  "str_quest_chat_25953011": "The urge...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25953012": "Y-You're not thinking of hurting anyone, are you Yuebai?!",
  "str_quest_chat_25953013": "Is that the kind of person you think I am?",
  "str_quest_chat_25953014": "I simply mean that I had the urge to do some wood carving, nothing more.",
  "str_quest_chat_25953015": "O-Oh, I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_25954001": "Good morning. Someone told me you were in the habit of doing morning exercises, is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_25954002": "That's right!",
  "str_quest_chat_25954003": "Only it was never really my choice, to begin with...",
  "str_quest_chat_25954004": "Not really...",
  "str_quest_chat_25954005": "But I really wish I did!",
  "str_quest_chat_25954006": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_25954007": "In the mornings, I like to swim a few dozen kilometers in the ocean before starting the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_25954008": "A-A few dozen kilometers?!",
  "str_quest_chat_25954009": "Indeed. You can join me whenever you want, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_25954010": "Thanks... But I think I'll stick with jogging.",
  "str_quest_chat_25961001": "The afternoon is absolutely sweltering... I need a shower.",
  "str_quest_chat_25961002": "Are you afraid of germs or something, Yuebai?",
  "str_quest_chat_25961003": "I wouldn't be living here if I was afraid of germs, would I?",
  "str_quest_chat_25961004": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_25961005": "No, it has nothing to do with cleanliness. My skin is prone to drying, which means I must take frequent baths to maintain my body's moisture.",
  "str_quest_chat_25961006": "Now if you'll excuse me...",
  "str_quest_chat_25961007": "I don't think Yuebai would last a day in the Rediesel Desert then...",
  "str_quest_chat_25962001": "My, my... The morning has already come and gone.",
  "str_quest_chat_25962002": "Tell me, do you know what time of the day is the most comfortable for swimming in the ocean?",
  "str_quest_chat_25962003": "Uh... The afternoon?",
  "str_quest_chat_25962004": "Exactly! Or at least I think so too.",
  "str_quest_chat_25962005": "But why? Isn't that the hottest part of the day too?",
  "str_quest_chat_25962006": "Precisely. And that heat, in turn, makes the ocean's waters all the more warm and relaxing.",
  "str_quest_chat_25962007": "Huh, never thought of it that way... I guess that makes sense!",
  "str_quest_chat_25981001": "It's getting late... I'm going to bed now.",
  "str_quest_chat_25981002": "Huh? I had no idea you went to bed so early, Yuebai?",
  "str_quest_chat_25981003": "Oh? Do I look like the type of person who stays up all night?",
  "str_quest_chat_25981004": "N-Not really, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_25981005": "A person's body is the foundation of their worth.",
  "str_quest_chat_25981006": "Don't think that you can do whatever you like to it simply because you are young.",
  "str_quest_chat_25981007": "You should try going to bed earlier, as well. Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_25981008": "Good night!",
  "str_quest_chat_25982001": "The sea at night carries a certain magic... A great, but terrifying presence.",
  "str_quest_chat_25982002": "Does that mean you're also afraid of the sea sometimes, Yuebai?",
  "str_quest_chat_25982003": "Of course. As we all should.",
  "str_quest_chat_25982004": "Despite my passion for the sea, I know full well that it can never be conquered.",
  "str_quest_chat_25982005": "Before its colossal might, I am nothing more than a powerless insect.",
  "str_quest_chat_25982006": "But the more fear I have for the sea, the more I wish to embrace it.",
  "str_quest_chat_25982007": "I think I understand what you're saying...",
  "str_quest_chat_25982008": "Heheheh... Is that so?",
  "str_quest_chat_25982009": "Still, now is not the time for fear and wonder. It's getting late.",
  "str_quest_chat_25982010": "Good night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_25982011": "Good night.",
  "str_quest_chat_25983001": "Are you asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_25983002": "Not yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_25983003": "For a person to still be awake at this hour... Could it be that you are thinking of someone right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_25983004": "Actually, I'm thinking of my people, who are no longer with us today...",
  "str_quest_chat_25983005": "On cold, blustery nights such as this, it is natural to yearn for the warmth of one's family.",
  "str_quest_chat_25983006": "Do you think about your family at night too, Yuebai?",
  "str_quest_chat_25983007": "I do, but only so much.",
  "str_quest_chat_25983008": "After all, what good is it for a person to depend on another's warmth to survive?",
  "str_quest_chat_25983009": "In the end, we must all learn to depend on ourselves to weather the storms of life.",
  "str_quest_chat_25983010": "You know, you can depend on friends for things like that too, Yuebai.",
  "str_quest_chat_25983011": "Friends...?",
  "str_quest_chat_25983012": "Hmph. I will give it some thought later.",
  "str_quest_chat_26001001": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_26001002": "Are you the one who sent the Fireflies to clean my room?",
  "str_quest_chat_26001003": "That's right. Your room was so messy, I could barely see the floor!",
  "str_quest_chat_26001004": "I couldn't take it anymore, so I asked the Fireflies to help you tidy up a bit.",
  "str_quest_chat_26001005": "Well, tell them to go away! My room doesn't need cleaning!",
  "str_quest_chat_26001006": "H-Huh? Why not?!",
  "str_quest_chat_26001007": "Because there's nothing messy about my room to begin with! You just weren't looking closely enough!",
  "str_quest_chat_26001008": "Not to mention, I keep all kinds of priceless and delicate medicinal herbs in here!",
  "str_quest_chat_26001009": "If my room needs cleaning, I'll do it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_26001010": "Fine, fine... Since the world's greatest doctor asked so nicely...",
  "str_quest_chat_26001011": "I'll leave your room alone.",
  "str_quest_chat_26001012": "Oho? I had no idea you had such a high opinion of me!",
  "str_quest_chat_26001013": "Heheheh... I guess I should be more honest with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26001014": "The truth is... I really just don't want anyone to see how messy my room is.",
  "str_quest_chat_26001015": "But since you respect me so much, you'll keep this a secret from everyone, right? Right??",
  "str_quest_chat_26001016": "Sure, my lips are sealed... Now can I please let the Fireflies finish cleaning your room?",
  "str_quest_chat_26001017": "Go right ahead!",
  "str_quest_chat_26002001": "Hey PlayerName, I'm not sure if you remember or not...",
  "str_quest_chat_26002002": "But I'm a fiendling.",
  "str_quest_chat_26002003": "I remember!",
  "str_quest_chat_26002004": "So you do remember...",
  "str_quest_chat_26002005": "I forgot...",
  "str_quest_chat_26002006": "Huh? Y-You actually forgot?!",
  "str_quest_chat_26002007": "Why are you reminding me about this, anyways?",
  "str_quest_chat_26002008": "Because it seems like you're treating me just like everyone else, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_26002009": "Back in Longzhou, most people are at least somewhat afraid of fiendlings, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_26002010": "Even when we're taken in by large, reputable clans... It's usually because they want to take advantage of our powers.",
  "str_quest_chat_26002011": "It's nothing that complicated, I promise.",
  "str_quest_chat_26002012": "It doesn't matter if you're a fiendling or an Aurorian... Because we're all friends here!",
  "str_quest_chat_26002013": "So you really don't care that I'm a fiendling...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26002014": "If I'm lying, then I'll eat my own hat!",
  "str_quest_chat_26002015": "What? But you're not wearing a hat!",
  "str_quest_chat_26002016": "I-It's just a figure of speech... Anyways, I promise I'm telling the truth.",
  "str_quest_chat_26002017": "PlayerName... Th-Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26003001": "I'm sooooo maaaaad!!!",
  "str_quest_chat_26003002": "What's wrong, Liqing?",
  "str_quest_chat_26003003": "Someone had the gall to say that the medical expertise handed down to me by my master is nothing but a crock!",
  "str_quest_chat_26003004": "She obviously didn't follow my advice properly!",
  "str_quest_chat_26003005": "This really gets my goat! I feel like... like throwing away all the green peppers on the Colossus!",
  "str_quest_chat_26003006": "Calm down, calm down... Don't worry, I'll come to see you right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26003999": "Go see what's going on with Liqing!",
  "str_quest_chat_26041001": "Urgh...",
  "str_quest_chat_26041002": "I... I can't take it anymore...",
  "str_quest_chat_26041003": "What's the matter, Liqing?",
  "str_quest_chat_26041004": "M-My body feels hot all over... It's as if my very blood is on fire!",
  "str_quest_chat_26041005": "Do you have a fever or something?",
  "str_quest_chat_26041006": "No, I know exactly what a fever feels like... And this isn't it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26041007": "Still, there's something very familiar about this feeling...",
  "str_quest_chat_26041008": "Wait... I remember now! This is the same feeling I got after stealing my master's potion and drinking it!",
  "str_quest_chat_26041009": "Could it be that he is still punishing me...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26041010": "J-Just hang on, Liqing! I'll be right there!",
  "str_quest_chat_26041011": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_26041012": "No need, actually. I feel fine now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26041013": "That was quick...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26041014": "I understand now... This is what it feels like when a fiendling's power grows.",
  "str_quest_chat_26041015": "Now that the burning sensation has passed, I feel a lot lighter!",
  "str_quest_chat_26041016": "I haven't felt anything like this before... Not since I stole my master's potion.",
  "str_quest_chat_26041017": "Master Bu says, \"May my guidance help you grow, my disciple.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_26041018": "\"For only with the aid of the wise can a fiendling truly unlock their potential.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_26041019": "Looks like hanging around you was a good idea after all, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_26051001": "A day's plan starts at dawn!",
  "str_quest_chat_26051002": "You're up pretty early for a kid, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_26051003": "Hey! Watch what you say!",
  "str_quest_chat_26051004": "But you ARE a little kid... Aren't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_26051005": "Little kids like to sleep in all morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_26051006": "But mature grown-ups like me get to work bright and early!",
  "str_quest_chat_26051007": "In fact, I gathered all kinds of herbs and remedies just this morning!",
  "str_quest_chat_26051008": "Unlike you, PlayerName, who spent the entire morning snoozing your day away.",
  "str_quest_chat_26051009": "Er... Fine...",
  "str_quest_chat_26051010": "You win.",
  "str_quest_chat_26052001": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_26052002": "Wake up, wake up, wake up!",
  "str_quest_chat_26052003": "Wh-What's the matter, Liqing?",
  "str_quest_chat_26052004": "Nothing, it's just time for you to get out of bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_26052005": "It's still way too early...",
  "str_quest_chat_26052006": "Are you sure you're not just pranking me?",
  "str_quest_chat_26052007": "I would never do something like that, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_26052008": "This is the time of day when a person's yang is rising.",
  "str_quest_chat_26052009": "If you wake up right now, you'll be full of energy for the rest of the day!",
  "str_quest_chat_26052010": "I don't get how losing this much sleep will make me feel more energized...",
  "str_quest_chat_26052011": "Master Bu says, \"It is better to trust in what is, than to refute what is not.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_26052012": "Alright, enough with the ancient wisdom... I'll take your word for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26052013": "Not like I can go back to sleep anymore...",
  "str_quest_chat_26061001": "Nothing guarantees a productive day like a full belly!",
  "str_quest_chat_26061002": "Bring me another serving of lunch when you get the chance, would you PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26061003": "Otherwise, I won't have the strength I need to make sure everyone is healthy and strong!",
  "str_quest_chat_26061004": "... You fed your portion to Tinytail, didn't you?",
  "str_quest_chat_26061005": "Hey, how'd you known?",
  "str_quest_chat_26061006": "Have you been learning from Li Tianxian or something?",
  "str_quest_chat_26061007": "Even though you have a healthy appetite, you could never eat two meals at once.",
  "str_quest_chat_26061008": "Hehehe...",
  "str_quest_chat_26061009": "Besides, you're a doctor, right? You should know better than anyone that our food isn't the best thing to feed a cat.",
  "str_quest_chat_26061010": "Shhh! Not so loud! Don't ever say that in front of Tinytail, got it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26061011": "Otherwise, you'll be nothing but a pile of ribbons by the time he's done with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_26061012": "Uh...",
  "str_quest_chat_26062001": "Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_26062002": "Today's lunch looks way too unhealthy!",
  "str_quest_chat_26062003": "It's all a bunch of fried food... There isn't a single vegetable on my plate!",
  "str_quest_chat_26062004": "How is a person supposed to eat a proper, balanced meal like this?!",
  "str_quest_chat_26062005": "I didn't realize you had to consider so much just to eat...",
  "str_quest_chat_26062006": "Of course you do!",
  "str_quest_chat_26062007": "If you eat the way I tell you, I guarantee you'll live a hundred years longer!",
  "str_quest_chat_26062008": "Aw, crud... Tinytail wants to steal my lunch again...",
  "str_quest_chat_26062009": "I prepared you some nice cat food, didn't I?!",
  "str_quest_chat_26062010": "I-I should finish my lunch before he really gets mad!",
  "str_quest_chat_26062011": "... So how's the food?",
  "str_quest_chat_26062012": "Mmm! Oh, it's delicious! Munch, munch, munch...",
  "str_quest_chat_26062013": "So now it's not too \"unhealthy\" for you? Funny how that works...",
  "str_quest_chat_26063001": "Ahhh... I love the afternoon sun!",
  "str_quest_chat_26063002": "Days like this make me wish I could curl up in the grass and nap the day away...",
  "str_quest_chat_26063003": "You don't think it's too bright sometimes?",
  "str_quest_chat_26063004": "Not at all! Tinytail loves sunny days too!",
  "str_quest_chat_26063005": "That's cats for you, I suppose.",
  "str_quest_chat_26081001": "Yaaaawn... It's past my bedtime...",
  "str_quest_chat_26081002": "You go to bed pretty early too, huh Liqing?",
  "str_quest_chat_26081003": "That's just a normal, healthy habit, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26081004": "You know, your habits could use some work, PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_26081005": "Are you saying that I'm not healthy...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26081006": "Master Bu says, \"Early to bed, early to wake, and all of the world's wisdom is yours to take!\"",
  "str_quest_chat_26081007": "So take his word for it, and try to go to bed earlier, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_26081008": "I... Really don't know what to say to that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26081009": "Just say \"good night\" before it's too late, or you won't be able to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_26081010": "Sure... Good night, Liqing.",
  "str_quest_chat_26082001": "Good evening, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_26082002": "What's up, Liqing?",
  "str_quest_chat_26082003": "Say, uh... Did you get anything else to eat around here? Heheheh...",
  "str_quest_chat_26082004": "We just had dinner not too long ago, didn't we?",
  "str_quest_chat_26082005": "I'm not talking about a normal meal, you know? I'm talking about \"that\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_26082006": "\"That\"...? What's \"that\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_26082007": "You know... They're little, sweet, and come in all kinds of colors...",
  "str_quest_chat_26082008": "You're talking about candy, right? Aren't you the one who said eating candy is bad for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_26082009": "But my sweet tooth is killing me right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_26082010": "At this rate, I don't know if I'll be able to provide medical care for everyone... It's just so painful!",
  "str_quest_chat_26082011": "Fine, fine... I'll have the Fireflies bring you some candy. Just try not to eat too much, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_26082012": "Thanks a bunch, PlayerName! I'll make sure to take good care of you!",
  "str_quest_chat_26082013": "I'd rather not get sick at all...",
  "str_quest_chat_26101001": "You have a lot of friends, young Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101002": "I guess so... Why did you say that all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_26101003": "It was just a sudden impulse.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101004": "Lumopolis, Umbraton, the Rediesel Wrench, Northland...",
  "str_quest_chat_26101005": "People from all over the world with nothing in common... Some of them are even enemies.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101006": "But they manage to communicate with you happily and harmoniously.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101007": "Some of them have pretty intimidating titles.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101008": "But in reality, they are all interesting and good people.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101009": "So, this is why we all live in harmony!",
  "str_quest_chat_26101010": "Right. You have to treat people based on their innate essence.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101011": "I like the way you think.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101012": "You might be a little self-centered, Jeriah, but you're also a sweetie.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101013": "A sweetie?",
  "str_quest_chat_26101014": "Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't judge you like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101015": "Haha, no... I'm just a little surprised.",
  "str_quest_chat_26101016": "Thank you for complimenting me like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102001": "You're always so busy, little Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102002": "I can never find a chance to chat with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102003": "What's wrong, Jeriah?",
  "str_quest_chat_26102004": "If anything matter, you can be sure I'll be there whenever you need me!",
  "str_quest_chat_26102005": "Hmm... The problem lies in your overly-positive attitude.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102006": "I'm... too positive?",
  "str_quest_chat_26102007": "Little Caelestite, it doesn't matter who you're talking to, you always reply to them in the same way, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_26102008": "Well, yeah. Everyone here is my friend.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102009": "Have you ever thought about observing the scene before doing something?",
  "str_quest_chat_26102010": "For example, identifying what is most important and what you should do.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102011": "Well, I've never really thought about that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102012": "It's alright, I can teach you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102013": "You can try observing the people around you with me first.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102014": "Thank you! But I probably won't be able to do that...",
  "str_quest_chat_26102015": "I guess that, in my mind, some things are important, and some just aren't.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102016": "But when it comes to my friends, I don't really think like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102017": "And spending time with friends is very important in itself.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102018": "At least, that's what I think! Hahaha... Maybe I'm a little naive.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102019": "No, not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102020": "I understand now. That's what makes you, you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102021": "That's why I'm so interested in you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102022": "But trying to change you to get close to you... I suppose I was putting the cart before the horse.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102023": "It feels like the more you talk, the more complicated things become...",
  "str_quest_chat_26102024": "It's okay. You don't have to strain yourself to understand what I mean.",
  "str_quest_chat_26102025": "Just be yourself, that's enough.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103001": "Little Caelestite, what have you been up to recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_26103002": "Come and talk to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103003": "I haven't been up to anything particularly interesting recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_26103004": "There's only been one odd thing I've noticed.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103005": "And that's how enthusiastic you've been these days, Jeriah!",
  "str_quest_chat_26103006": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_26103007": "Yeah! You buried your nose in a book whenever you had a moment free.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103008": "Whenever I spoke with you, you seemed like you didn't care.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103009": "But lately, you've been coming to chat with me every day.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103010": "And whenever you ask me if I have any stories to tell you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103011": "Y-You haven't noticed anything strange about me recently, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_26103012": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103013": "It's just that I'm starting to think that you're really quite interesting, little Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103014": "Your stories sometimes surpass the knowledge available to one in those books.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103015": "This feeling is also very interesting in itself.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103016": "Tell me... Why do I think you're so special?",
  "str_quest_chat_26103017": "Huh? Don't ask me! I don't know either...",
  "str_quest_chat_26103018": "For example, what we're talking about right now is quite banal.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103019": "But I find it very interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103020": "Especially when I imagine you sitting there all embarrassed at the other end of the terminal.",
  "str_quest_chat_26103021": "You're really... Don't make fun of me! Go read a book!",
  "str_quest_chat_26103022": "Hah! No, no, no.",
  "str_quest_chat_26104001": "Are you free, young Caelestite? Fancy a chat?",
  "str_quest_chat_26104002": "Hey, I was just looking for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_26104003": "Looking for me? Wow, it must be my lucky day!",
  "str_quest_chat_26104004": "Vice said that she sent a letter to the Rediesel Wrench, but she still hasn't heard back from them.",
  "str_quest_chat_26104005": "Do you think there may have been... a problem with the delivery?",
  "str_quest_chat_26104006": "Hehe, why don't you just come on over and find out for yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_26104999": "Go find Jeriah!",
  "str_quest_chat_26141001": "Hello, little Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141002": "I'm Jeriah, a senior member of Courier Union Rediesel Wrench branch.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141003": "Let's get to know each other better, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_26141004": "Hello! I hope you can get used to life on the Colossus, Lady Jeriah.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141005": "Just call me Jeriah!",
  "str_quest_chat_26141006": "I don't care much about details, so you don't need to worry about me too much.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141007": "Let's just take it easy and see what happens.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141008": "Alright, Jeriah!",
  "str_quest_chat_26141009": "In that case, I'll just assign work directly to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141010": "So, first we have the kitchen. Can you cook?",
  "str_quest_chat_26141011": "Hmm... I guess so.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141012": "It's okay if you can't. Everyone cooks together, so you can pick it up at your own pace.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141013": "Well, I'll just read and study up on it first.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141014": "It'll be faster if you just get some hands-on experience.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141015": "Hmm, well, I'll try.",
  "str_quest_chat_26141016": "Why do I get the feeling you're not really interested in what I'm saying...",
  "str_quest_chat_26142001": "I feel like I've become stronger recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142002": "I'm not good at flying high in the sky, so I always let Hawk take care of that for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142003": "But maybe I can give it a try now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142004": "Just make sure you take care.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142005": "Don't worry... I know my limits.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142006": "After all, I've been traveling alone for so many years.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142007": "That's impressive.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142008": "If you get stronger, you'll be able to fly as high as the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142009": "Heheh... That's perhaps going a little too far.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142010": "But I don't want to rely on my wings too much.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142011": "If I could fly like the Colossus, that'd be pretty fast, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_26142012": "Right! Soroz can fly really fast!",
  "str_quest_chat_26142013": "But if that were the case, traveling would become simply a matter of going directly from one point to another.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142014": "The process of traveling would cease to exist.",
  "str_quest_chat_26142015": "Right...",
  "str_quest_chat_26142016": "When it comes to traveling, I prefer a down-to-earth approach.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143001": "Naroxel came to talk to me just now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143002": "She suddenly said I've become easier to get along with.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143003": "Is it true? Have I changed?",
  "str_quest_chat_26143004": "A little.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143005": "You've always been pretty easygoing.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143006": "But sometimes I felt it was difficult to talk with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143007": "But now, I rarely get such a feeling.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143008": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143009": "You've always been quite talkative.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143010": "You're a little scatterbrained...",
  "str_quest_chat_26143011": "But you're easy to get along with!",
  "str_quest_chat_26143012": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143013": "From my own point of view, I think the people around me changed.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143014": "I wasn't used to cooperating with people and carrying out duties and obligations.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143015": "But gradually, my surrounding environment began to change with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143016": "These things don't seem so unbearable anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143017": "Maybe this is what people mean by \"getting along.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_26143018": "In order for both parties to change, we need to find a way to get along that suits us both.",
  "str_quest_chat_26143019": "\"Getting along\"... This definition is very accurate. I like it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144001": "Do you remember that Grimoire I carry around with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_26144002": "I started rereading it recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144003": "Maybe my general ability has improved.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144004": "I have a new understanding of the knowledge in this book now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144005": "It's fantastic.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144006": "I'll be counting on you in our future battles!",
  "str_quest_chat_26144007": "Don't say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144008": "Although I have confidence in the Grimoire, and in myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144009": "But this Grimoire... or should I say, this ancient wisdom...",
  "str_quest_chat_26144010": "I don't think we should use it carelessly.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144011": "Is it dangerous?",
  "str_quest_chat_26144012": "It does contain extraordinary power.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144013": "But more importantly, we should treat the unknown with caution.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144014": "And the more powerful you are, the more careful you should use your power.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144015": "I thought you would always be addicted to new and exciting things.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144016": "It's certainly addictive.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144017": "When totally indulged in it, I even find myself afraid of my excessive curiosity.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144018": "Curiosity is also the first step to destruction.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144019": "Yes... You're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144020": "Should I also reflect upon how to treat my own ability?",
  "str_quest_chat_26144021": "Wow... This is getting too deep for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_26144022": "Haha, it's good to think deeply.",
  "str_quest_chat_26144023": "Any confusion you may feel just signifies that you are working hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_26151001": "Good morning, little Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_26151002": "Morning, Jeriah.",
  "str_quest_chat_26151003": "I know by now that you love slacking off, but you're always up pretty early.",
  "str_quest_chat_26151004": "Don't be so judgmental.",
  "str_quest_chat_26151005": "I cherish time very much.",
  "str_quest_chat_26151006": "I don't waste my time on things that bore me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26151007": "If someone else said that, I'd think it was just an excuse.",
  "str_quest_chat_26151008": "But it sounds so convincing coming out of your mouth...",
  "str_quest_chat_26152001": "It's the perfect time to read a book.",
  "str_quest_chat_26152002": "I happen to have some random books here.",
  "str_quest_chat_26152003": "Would you like to take a look?",
  "str_quest_chat_26152004": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_26152005": "What are they about?",
  "str_quest_chat_26152006": "No thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_26152007": "I'm not into reading...",
  "str_quest_chat_26152008": "Don't say that. These books are very interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_26152009": "They're adventure novels.",
  "str_quest_chat_26152010": "Adventure novels?",
  "str_quest_chat_26152011": "Well, they're about young boys and girls around your age...",
  "str_quest_chat_26152012": "No, never mind...",
  "str_quest_chat_26152013": "The subject matter may be a little too mature for someone your age.",
  "str_quest_chat_26152014": "Forget I said anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_26152015": "When you talk about it like that, it makes me want to read it!",
  "str_quest_chat_26153001": "I saw someone going back and forth outside the Colossus in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_26153002": "It was Naroxel, wasn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26153003": "Yes, Jeriah... Have you been causing her trouble again?",
  "str_quest_chat_26153004": "Maybe. I'm not sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_26153005": "But I didn't do anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_26153006": "You not doing anything is what always causes trouble for her!",
  "str_quest_chat_26153007": "I don't know how you two have managed to get along so well up to this point...",
  "str_quest_chat_26153008": "Who knows, after all, I never try to please her.",
  "str_quest_chat_26153009": "But Naroxel never complains about the work you owe her.",
  "str_quest_chat_26153010": "Yes. Interpersonal relationships are really wonderful things.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161001": "Time to take a break.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161002": "Little Caelestite, talk with me for a while.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161003": "Sure. What do you want to talk about?",
  "str_quest_chat_26161004": "Hmm... Let's talk about your relationship with Carleen and Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161005": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_26161006": "Why are you so surprised?",
  "str_quest_chat_26161007": "I didn't have you pinned as someone who likes to gossip.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161008": "Gossip is an important element of social mobility.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161009": "These tiny relationships drive the huge gear of society forward.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161010": "The three of you are the main axis of relations on the Colossus, which is of great observational value.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161011": "T-That's so profound... but I still don't want to talk about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_26161012": "No matter how I answer, it's going to lead to trouble.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161013": "Don't worry, we can change the subject.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161014": "We can talk about your close relationships with the others aboard the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_26161015": "I just remembered I have something really urgent I need to do... Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_26162001": "Your Colossus is really quite lively.",
  "str_quest_chat_26162002": "Yeah, everyone likes to have fun together when there's nothing else to do.",
  "str_quest_chat_26162003": "I can see, for example, that people are currently seizing the chance to sing together.",
  "str_quest_chat_26162004": "Are you listening to them singing right now, Jeriah?",
  "str_quest_chat_26162005": "No, I'm reading.",
  "str_quest_chat_26162006": "How can you read with all that noise?",
  "str_quest_chat_26162007": "Well, after all, my parents are rock stars.",
  "str_quest_chat_26162008": "That's so hard to imagine...",
  "str_quest_chat_26163001": "Little Caelestite, fancy a snack?",
  "str_quest_chat_26163002": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_26163003": "Alright, but don't eat too much.",
  "str_quest_chat_26163004": "Otherwise, you'll put on weight, considering how little exercise you do.",
  "str_quest_chat_26163005": "Don't mention my weight when inviting me to eat!",
  "str_quest_chat_26163006": "Never mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_26163007": "I ate too much at noon. I'm not hungry now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26163008": "I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_26163009": "Hawk has just returned with some fresh liver.",
  "str_quest_chat_26163010": "After a little preparation, it'll be ready for you to eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_26163011": "Wait, when you said snack, you meant liver?",
  "str_quest_chat_26163012": "Yes, it's delicious, especially when served raw.",
  "str_quest_chat_26163013": "I-I feel sick...",
  "str_quest_chat_26163014": "Oh, that's a pity.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181001": "The stars are out.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181002": "When traveling, I always try to find somewhere to stay before it gets dark.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181003": "I'm usually ready to relax around the campfire when the stars light up the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181004": "Under the light of the moon, accompanied by the glow of the fire.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181005": "You're painting a very romantic picture.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181006": "In this respect, there are many things one must consider when out rambling.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181007": "Is it dangerous not finding a good place to camp before nightfall?",
  "str_quest_chat_26181008": "Yes. One should take precautions in advance.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181009": "It's very important for travelers to refer to celestial phenomena.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181010": "In doing so, you will realize for yourself that we are insignificant before the vast galaxy.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181011": "I've been traveling in the Colossus all this time. I've never thought much about these things...",
  "str_quest_chat_26181012": "Then try leaving the Colossus occasionally to go hiking with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26181013": "I will teach you all about the ways of the wanderer.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182001": "Are you free, little Caelestite?",
  "str_quest_chat_26182002": "I want to ask you something.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182003": "You want to ask me something? Oh, boy...",
  "str_quest_chat_26182004": "Well, if I can actually help you...",
  "str_quest_chat_26182005": "Just now, I ran into Sinsa and had a casual little chat with him.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182006": "As we talked, his face became uglier and uglier.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182007": "Wh-What did you say to him!?",
  "str_quest_chat_26182008": "Hmm... Nothing. I just said hello at first.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182009": "Then we talked about his sister.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182010": "I can probably guess what happened... What did you say?",
  "str_quest_chat_26182011": "Sinsa mentioned that his sister seems to be acting a little cold toward him recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182012": "I told him it was inevitable.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182013": "Girls will always have secrets they don't want to share with their families, no matter how close they are.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182014": "This is something one must learn to accept.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182015": "Then, Sinsa's face began to change.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182016": "That's what I thought.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182017": "What you said is true... It's just a bit cruel to put it to Sinsa like that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182018": "It seems I said something I shouldn't have said.",
  "str_quest_chat_26182019": "Hahahah...",
  "str_quest_chat_26183001": "Today's dinner didn't taste very good.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183002": "I'm not a big fan of that stuff you call nutritional supplement cream.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183003": "I think it's pretty good.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183004": "I've been eating nutritional supplement creams all my life.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183005": "In fact, I find it difficult to get used to new kinds of food.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183006": "This is an extreme case of a culinary culture clash.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183007": "I don't like it either.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183008": "A lot of the people here say they can't get used to the cream...",
  "str_quest_chat_26183009": "I'm a little tired of eating it, after all this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183010": "I still prefer eating food cooked by others.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183011": "You can sample delicious food from all over the world on this Colossus. It's great.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183012": "But wait—someone should be on cooking duty today...",
  "str_quest_chat_26183013": "Hang on... It's you!",
  "str_quest_chat_26183014": "Correct.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183015": "Why did you skip work again!?",
  "str_quest_chat_26183016": "Sorry, I forgot.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183017": "I'll remember next time.",
  "str_quest_chat_26183018": "You...",
  "str_quest_chat_26201001": "A small package arrived at my door. Did you send it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26201002": "Yes, you weren't in when I delivered it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26201003": "Please confirm that you have received it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26201004": "I've received it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26201005": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26201006": "I opened it... and there was a small bottle filled with water inside.",
  "str_quest_chat_26201007": "It's water from Lake Mirror.",
  "str_quest_chat_26201008": "In Northland, boys gather water from Lake Mirror and put it into a small bottle.",
  "str_quest_chat_26201009": "Then they make it into a necklace for their sweetheart.",
  "str_quest_chat_26201010": "It's supposed to symbolize \"pure love.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_26201011": "If you have a special someone, you can give it to them.",
  "str_quest_chat_26201012": "Of course, feel free to call me, and I'll deliver it for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26201013": "Are you looking for extra business?",
  "str_quest_chat_26201014": "Hah, alright.",
  "str_quest_chat_26202001": "Are you free right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_26202002": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_26202003": "I'm busy.",
  "str_quest_chat_26202004": "Sorry...",
  "str_quest_chat_26202005": "I'm kidding. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_26202006": "The last time I was out delivering mail, I saw how bustling the Rediesel Wrench market was.",
  "str_quest_chat_26202007": "I'm off work today, and wanted to ask you to go check it out with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26202008": "Okay, but wait a minute. Let me just grab something...",
  "str_quest_chat_26202009": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26202010": "I don't know where I put my little fan.",
  "str_quest_chat_26202011": "Why do you need a fan?",
  "str_quest_chat_26202012": "It's so hot over at the Rediesel Wrench.",
  "str_quest_chat_26202013": "You're from Northland. You might not be able to handle it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26202014": "So, I want to go find my little fan to cool you down.",
  "str_quest_chat_26202015": "Actually, I'm used to sending mail to all kinds of places.",
  "str_quest_chat_26202016": "But you're so considerate.. I'm really touched...",
  "str_quest_chat_26202017": "I-I'll do it!",
  "str_quest_chat_26202018": "Huh? Do what?",
  "str_quest_chat_26202019": "I'll send mail for you for free... for a whole year!",
  "str_quest_chat_26202020": "Oh, thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_26203001": "Sorry! We're going to have to cancel our plans for today...",
  "str_quest_chat_26203002": "I just received a shift adjustment notification... and we were supposed to go out and have fun together...",
  "str_quest_chat_26203003": "Oh, don't worry about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26203004": "Your job sure is a tough one. Let me see you off at the bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_26203999": "Go to the bridge to see Kya, who temporarily has to work overtime.",
  "str_quest_chat_26241001": "It's strange... Karnet seems to have grown.",
  "str_quest_chat_26241002": "His talons are sharper, and his wings are longer.",
  "str_quest_chat_26241003": "Could it be because he's been eating so much, recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_26241004": "Huh? Isn't Karnet a Speaker?",
  "str_quest_chat_26241005": "Speakers don't need to eat, do they?",
  "str_quest_chat_26241006": "Right...",
  "str_quest_chat_26241007": "I know!",
  "str_quest_chat_26241008": "It's not that Karnet's getting fatter—",
  "str_quest_chat_26241009": "I'm getting stronger! I can suddenly feel a surge of power in my body!",
  "str_quest_chat_26241010": "You only just realized...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26241011": "I was busy delivering mail. I guess I just ignored the fact that I've changed.",
  "str_quest_chat_26241012": "No wonder Karnet has also become stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_26241013": "Thanks to your care, we've become stronger so quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_26241014": "I didn't do anything, hehe. Congratulations to the two of you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26242001": "PlayerName...",
  "str_quest_chat_26242002": "Do you think I'm annoying?",
  "str_quest_chat_26242003": "No, why?",
  "str_quest_chat_26242004": "*sob* I feel like everyone in the union's giving me the cold shoulder...",
  "str_quest_chat_26242005": "What? Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_26242006": "I used to be busy every day until late in the evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_26242007": "But I've been finishing work in the afternoon, recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_26242008": "I think they're assigning less mail to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26242009": "Perhaps you've become stronger and more efficient.",
  "str_quest_chat_26242010": "Ah!",
  "str_quest_chat_26242011": "I suppose you have a point—",
  "str_quest_chat_26242012": "Recently, I don't feel as weighed down by my mailbag, even though it looks the same size as my body!",
  "str_quest_chat_26242013": "So... I'm gonna need a bigger bag.",
  "str_quest_chat_26242014": "Even bigger? I already can't see you over your current bag...",
  "str_quest_chat_26251001": "Good morning. We're having breakfast, wanna join us?",
  "str_quest_chat_26251002": "No, I'm heading out to send mail.",
  "str_quest_chat_26251003": "Eat some food, then you'll have enough strength to deliver mail.",
  "str_quest_chat_26251004": "You have a point. What's for breakfast?",
  "str_quest_chat_26251005": "Vice made... chocolate noodles and blueberry beef Patties.",
  "str_quest_chat_26251006": "Are you... trying to poison me?",
  "str_quest_chat_26251007": "It taste's surprisingly good. Just don't look at it...",
  "str_quest_chat_26251008": "No thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_26251009": "Give it a try.",
  "str_quest_chat_26251010": "Hmm... Okay, I'll send Karnet to fetch some.",
  "str_quest_chat_26252001": "Ahhhhhhhh!",
  "str_quest_chat_26252002": "Whoa! What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_26252003": "I overslept! I'm gonna be late for work!",
  "str_quest_chat_26252004": "This is the first time I've ever been late! Am I gonna get fired!?",
  "str_quest_chat_26252005": "Erm... It's not time for work yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_26252006": "And most people in the union don't get up so early, do they?",
  "str_quest_chat_26252007": "So... you expect me to lower myself to their standards?",
  "str_quest_chat_26252008": "I can't do it. My conscience won't stand for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26252009": "Relax. Don't push yourself too hard.",
  "str_quest_chat_26252010": "I'm going back to sleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_26252011": "Wait! What did you just say?",
  "str_quest_chat_26252012": "Relax? Go back to sleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_26252013": "You said it's not time for work?!",
  "str_quest_chat_26252014": "That's right.",
  "str_quest_chat_26252015": "Oh, I remember now...",
  "str_quest_chat_26252016": "I put my clock forward so that I wouldn't be late.",
  "str_quest_chat_26252017": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_26261001": "Hmm... I can't eat this stuff.",
  "str_quest_chat_26261002": "It's lunchtime. Aren't you eating?",
  "str_quest_chat_26261003": "I've got a sudden craving for spicy fried noodles from the Rediesel Wrench.",
  "str_quest_chat_26261004": "Spicy fried noodles... Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.",
  "str_quest_chat_26261005": "Yeah! Should we go get some, now?",
  "str_quest_chat_26261006": "Nah.",
  "str_quest_chat_26261007": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_26261008": "If we go now, we'll miss lunchtime.",
  "str_quest_chat_26261009": "The union only gives me an hour for the lunch break.",
  "str_quest_chat_26261010": "But isn't it your day off today?",
  "str_quest_chat_26261011": "Still, I can't let myself get complacent.",
  "str_quest_chat_26261012": "Delicious spicy fried noodles... Delicious spicy fried noodles!",
  "str_quest_chat_26261013": "Hmm... Okay, let's go—right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_26262001": "What are you doing?",
  "str_quest_chat_26262002": "I just finished lunch and came back to my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_26262003": "Is it raining?",
  "str_quest_chat_26262004": "It sure is.",
  "str_quest_chat_26262005": "Do you need an umbrella? I can send one to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26262006": "I'm indoors... I don't need one.",
  "str_quest_chat_26262007": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_26262008": "Do you need an umbrella? I can send one to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26262009": "???",
  "str_quest_chat_26262010": "I've finished delivering today's mail. I'm so bored.",
  "str_quest_chat_26262011": "Think carefully—is there anything you need me to send?",
  "str_quest_chat_26262012": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_26281001": "Good evening. Do you think you can help me find happiness?",
  "str_quest_chat_26281002": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_26281003": "A mother wanted me to send happiness to her child.",
  "str_quest_chat_26281004": "Happiness... That's some fragile cargo.",
  "str_quest_chat_26281005": "What does happiness mean to a child?",
  "str_quest_chat_26281006": "Mom's cooking?",
  "str_quest_chat_26281007": "Anything Mom make?",
  "str_quest_chat_26281008": "Good thinking! You've helped me solve another problem!",
  "str_quest_chat_26281009": "To show you how grateful I am, I'm gonna make you breakfast myself!",
  "str_quest_chat_26281010": "Are you a good cook?",
  "str_quest_chat_26281011": "No, but I can learn.",
  "str_quest_chat_26281012": "That sounds pretty risky, on my part...",
  "str_quest_chat_26281013": "What?",
  "str_quest_chat_26281014": "Forget about it. It was nothing, and you don't need to thank me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26282001": "Still not asleep?",
  "str_quest_chat_26282002": "Do you also lose sleep thinking about how you can't save the world?",
  "str_quest_chat_26282003": "So, this is the kind of thing you're thinking about every day! That's insane!",
  "str_quest_chat_26282004": "I'm just planning my delivery route for tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_26282005": "But hearing you say that, I feel like my problems are nothing compared to yours.",
  "str_quest_chat_26282006": "I was just joking... Did you really think I was being serious?",
  "str_quest_chat_26282007": "Actually, I was just thinking about what to eat tomorrow...",
  "str_quest_chat_26301001": "Sigh... I kept getting woken up by sudden noises recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_26301002": "Do you know how to improve the quality of sleep, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26301003": "You might need to soundproof your surrounding.",
  "str_quest_chat_26301004": "I see I have to mod the lounge chair...",
  "str_quest_chat_26301005": "Like installing a sound screen so I can enjoy peaceful sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_26301006": "That sounds a bit overboard.",
  "str_quest_chat_26301007": "How about earplugs? I saw those in Umbraton. They're small and light.",
  "str_quest_chat_26301008": "Just roll up the rubber to fit your ears and stuff them in...",
  "str_quest_chat_26301009": "That's the easy way to keep the noises out.",
  "str_quest_chat_26301010": "That sounds great! I'll get someone to make a pair for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_26301011": "That will stop noises from waking me up! Thank you!",
  "str_quest_chat_26301012": "No problem!",
  "str_quest_chat_26301013": "But remember to take them out, Tina, or you won't be able to hear.",
  "str_quest_chat_26301014": "Okay!",
  "str_quest_chat_26302001": "What do you do in spare time, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26302002": "Nothing.",
  "str_quest_chat_26302003": "Exercise.",
  "str_quest_chat_26302004": "What about you, Tina?",
  "str_quest_chat_26302005": "I like to curl up in my lounge chair and read novels.",
  "str_quest_chat_26302006": "I love all kinds of novels.",
  "str_quest_chat_26302007": "Nothing beats reading in a cozy environment!",
  "str_quest_chat_26302008": "Reading novels stimulates the mind. It's a wonderful hobby!",
  "str_quest_chat_26302009": "Let me see... I'm reading chapter seven of the Sheep-Loving Eclipsite next.",
  "str_quest_chat_26302010": "What? The title sounds weird...",
  "str_quest_chat_26302011": "Yeah, creative titles like that are the rage these days!",
  "str_quest_chat_26302012": "I read classic stories too, and feel the current crop of authors lack imagination!",
  "str_quest_chat_26302013": "What other books do you like, Tina?",
  "str_quest_chat_26302014": "Legends of the Immortal Empire: Light of White Night. That one I read many times!",
  "str_quest_chat_26302015": "I see you're into a wide variety of subjects!",
  "str_quest_chat_26302016": "Books are what keep the Aurorian imagination alive. If you only read one genre of novels...",
  "str_quest_chat_26302017": "You will become bland and boring!",
  "str_quest_chat_26302018": "I didn't realize that's the case...",
  "str_quest_chat_26341001": "Other than me, do you know anyone else with narcolepsy, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26341002": "No. You're the only one I know with narcolepsy, Tina.",
  "str_quest_chat_26341003": "I see!",
  "str_quest_chat_26341004": "I guess that makes me unique to you, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_26341005": "Yes, you do have a special condition, Tina.",
  "str_quest_chat_26341006": "Sleep is a bliss to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26341007": "So I feel that \"special condition\" isn't anything bad.",
  "str_quest_chat_26341008": "If I'm cured of it one day, it might even make me anxious!",
  "str_quest_chat_26341009": "You truly are a glass-half-full person, Tina!",
  "str_quest_chat_26341010": "You think so? But that's really how I feel!",
  "str_quest_chat_26341011": "Let me know if you need help from me, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_26341012": "Sure!",
  "str_quest_chat_26342001": "A guy colleague got the idea of challenging me to arm wrestling today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26342002": "I ended up beating him but I swear I held back!",
  "str_quest_chat_26342003": "Though that seemed to be a big hit to his pride...",
  "str_quest_chat_26342004": "What, you were challenged?",
  "str_quest_chat_26342005": "I usually conceal my Divine Hand, so my left hand looks normal.",
  "str_quest_chat_26342006": "I suggested that since I'm left-handed, we should arm-wrestle with the right.",
  "str_quest_chat_26342007": "That actually sounds like you were mocking him...",
  "str_quest_chat_26342008": "But he insisted on using the left hand, so he only lasted two seconds.",
  "str_quest_chat_26342009": "I checked his arm afterward and, luckily, no broken bones!",
  "str_quest_chat_26342010": "I see why it was a big blow to his pride...",
  "str_quest_chat_26342011": "Really? I should stay away from challenges like that next time!",
  "str_quest_chat_26342012": "I've gotten a lot stronger lately, so I have to be careful using my left hand.",
  "str_quest_chat_26342013": "I believe he won't be challenging you anytime soon...",
  "str_quest_chat_26343001": "My Divine Hand suddenly unleashed a blinding glow that inundated the room.",
  "str_quest_chat_26343002": "Fortunately, today is not a workday or my colleagues would be spooked.",
  "str_quest_chat_26343003": "Wait, so you lost control of the Divine Hand?",
  "str_quest_chat_26343004": "For a second, I could feel great energy surging inside me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26343005": "So I'm sure the Hand felt the same intensity too...",
  "str_quest_chat_26343006": "You got even more powerful, Tina!",
  "str_quest_chat_26343007": "Yeah, but that also caused new problems!",
  "str_quest_chat_26343008": "What problems?",
  "str_quest_chat_26343009": "The last time I lift a teacup with my left hand, I crushed it to smithereens.",
  "str_quest_chat_26343010": "Naturally, the tea got spilled all over me...",
  "str_quest_chat_26343011": "Then once, a colleague was choking, so I slapped him on the back...",
  "str_quest_chat_26343012": "I used the left hand out of habit and toppled him to the ground.",
  "str_quest_chat_26343013": "So he's been somewhat afraid of me... Even though I was being very careful...",
  "str_quest_chat_26343014": "Being powerful is indeed a problem, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_26361001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_26361002": "Afternoon, Tina.",
  "str_quest_chat_26361003": "What are you doing, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26361004": "Just regular maintenance on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_26361005": "Need help? Maybe I can get the family specialist to assist you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26361006": "Thanks for the thought, but I think I can handle it myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_26361007": "I've been doing the upkeep for a very long time, so I know all the ins and outs already.",
  "str_quest_chat_26361008": "True. It's easy to make mistakes if you're not familiar with the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_26362001": "Hey, it's noon already.",
  "str_quest_chat_26362002": "Time for a break...",
  "str_quest_chat_26362003": "Are you going to sleep, Tina?",
  "str_quest_chat_26362004": "I worked two hours this morning, so I got two waking hours left in the day.",
  "str_quest_chat_26362005": "I must put them to good use in the afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_26362006": "Oh, I feel drowsy...",
  "str_quest_chat_26362007": "It seems planning a sleep schedule is a part of your essential routine now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26362008": "Well, I have a job with the Hall of Justice now, so I can't be acting like a child!",
  "str_quest_chat_26362009": "I'm just grateful for everybody tolerating me!",
  "str_quest_chat_26362010": "And I have to thank Leyn in particular. He's helped me so much!",
  "str_quest_chat_26362011": "So I made a vow to not let everyone down!",
  "str_quest_chat_26362012": "You and Leyn are the perfect partners, Tina.",
  "str_quest_chat_26363001": "Good afternoon, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_26363002": "Afternoon, Tina.",
  "str_quest_chat_26363003": "My case went very smoothly today! I can finish my work on time!",
  "str_quest_chat_26363004": "Oh yeah? You must have had a productive morning, Tina!",
  "str_quest_chat_26363005": "Wait, I see a stack of paper under the table I haven't gotten to yet...",
  "str_quest_chat_26363006": "I remember now... Mr. Matthieu gave it to me yesterday!",
  "str_quest_chat_26363007": "Oh, and here I thought I could relax a little today...",
  "str_quest_chat_26363008": "It's not easy being a Judge, I see.",
  "str_quest_chat_26363009": "I have to be serious, for it's important to resolve disputes.",
  "str_quest_chat_26363010": "Can't talk, I must get busy now!",
  "str_quest_chat_26363011": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_26364001": "Ah, it's noon already.",
  "str_quest_chat_26364002": "Have you had lunch, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26364003": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_26364004": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_26364005": "Lunch is the most important meal of the day!",
  "str_quest_chat_26364006": "I usually get to eat twice during my waking hours.",
  "str_quest_chat_26364007": "Yeah, you don't spend much time on meals due to narcolepsy.",
  "str_quest_chat_26364008": "That's right! So don't underestimate the power of lunch, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_26364009": "I'll take it seriously from now on!",
  "str_quest_chat_26364010": "Good!",
  "str_quest_chat_26365001": "You should have a strong cup of tea in the afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_26365002": "Have you heard of Campbell's Select Tea, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26365003": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_26365004": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_26365005": "So, Campbell's Select Tea is well-known in Lumopolis!",
  "str_quest_chat_26365006": "It is made from tea leaves selected by Campbell artisans, and is available in limited quantities.",
  "str_quest_chat_26365007": "It sells out every time as soon as it comes out.",
  "str_quest_chat_26365008": "It's tea from your family, Tina? I think it's piquing my interest!",
  "str_quest_chat_26365009": "My mother would save some for me every year. I still have quite a bit at home!",
  "str_quest_chat_26365010": "I can share with you later, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_26365011": "Really? I look forward to it!",
  "str_quest_chat_26381001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_26381002": "I slept and didn't think it would be this late...",
  "str_quest_chat_26381003": "Did you sleep until work let out?",
  "str_quest_chat_26381004": "Yeah, I noticed everyone was gone after I woke up, but there's nothing I could do about that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26381005": "If I push myself now, I can still hit today's quota.",
  "str_quest_chat_26381006": "What? You're just starting work right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_26381007": "It's not a big deal. I'm used to working at night!",
  "str_quest_chat_26381008": "You got this, Tina!",
  "str_quest_chat_26382001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_26382002": "Going to bed, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26382003": "Not yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_26382004": "The breeze is very nice at night over here.",
  "str_quest_chat_26382005": "I just love the undisturbed, quiet time to myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_26382006": "Yeah, the tranquility can ease whatever trouble you're feeling.",
  "str_quest_chat_26382007": "Oh, it's very late in the night now!",
  "str_quest_chat_26382008": "I won't keep you up then. Good night, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_26383001": "It's dark already... Time flies!",
  "str_quest_chat_26383002": "How was your day, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26383003": "A boring one.",
  "str_quest_chat_26383004": "An interesting one.",
  "str_quest_chat_26383005": "That's a great day of sleep for me!",
  "str_quest_chat_26383006": "Ahem, isn't it like that every day for you, Tina?",
  "str_quest_chat_26383007": "Hee! I do have nightmares sometimes, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat_26384001": "Would you like to know how to fall asleep fast, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26384002": "You got tricks, Tina?",
  "str_quest_chat_26384003": "Have a glass of warm milk beforehand. It makes you sleepier when you're full!",
  "str_quest_chat_26384004": "Also, listening to classical music helps you relax and go to sleep!",
  "str_quest_chat_26384005": "You're a sleep expert, all right, with all the tips and hints.",
  "str_quest_chat_26384006": "I get drowsy naturally, so I don't need sleeping aids most of the time!",
  "str_quest_chat_26384007": "But all those are effective ways to fall asleep fast, if you need it!",
  "str_quest_chat_26384008": "Okay, I shall try it tonight!",
  "str_quest_chat_26401001": "Hello, given that we've known each other for a while now...",
  "str_quest_chat_26401002": "I would like to ask for an assessment of my job performance.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401003": "How do you view my performance?",
  "str_quest_chat_26401004": "You are very diligent and responsible, Leyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401005": "And it's impressive how you handled all those tasks by yourself!",
  "str_quest_chat_26401006": "Thank you for the praise. I'm very grateful.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401007": "How is your opinion of my demeanor?",
  "str_quest_chat_26401008": "You are... unique in that regard, Leyn!",
  "str_quest_chat_26401009": "No need to be tactful. Please tell me about anything I can improve on.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401010": "Since you put it that way...",
  "str_quest_chat_26401011": "You could be less formal in your speech.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401012": "You are my friend, Leyn, just like everyone else.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401013": "We can ditch the formality.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401014": "You don't have to watch over me all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401015": "You're always so respectful to me, Leyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401016": "And that kind of throws me off...",
  "str_quest_chat_26401017": "I'd like us to be on a more even footing!",
  "str_quest_chat_26401018": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_26401019": "I will try.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401020": "Thanks, my friend... Like that?",
  "str_quest_chat_26401021": "Yes, like that!",
  "str_quest_chat_26401022": "So, are you busy today? Anything I can help you with?",
  "str_quest_chat_26401023": "I'm free today, nothing on the plate.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401024": "Why don't we go check out Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_26401025": "Let's get a fun food tour going!",
  "str_quest_chat_26401026": "I cannot do this...",
  "str_quest_chat_26401027": "This is just not working for me. Please forgive me and allow me to resume my old ways.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401028": "It's that difficult for you to just relax, Leyn...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26401029": "It's all right, there's no \"must\" between friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401030": "Don't force yourself if you're not comfortable with it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401031": "I appreciate your magnanimity.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401032": "Then let's get ready for the trip!",
  "str_quest_chat_26401033": "Please allow me to postpone it and give me time to mentally prepare.",
  "str_quest_chat_26401034": "Huh? Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_26402001": "I must make a confession.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402002": "You are a person extremely worthy of my service.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402003": "Hence, I have been pondering how to serve you as your knight.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402004": "I can sense that many others understand you more than I do.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402005": "But I tried to imitate them to no avail.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402006": "Since I am neither able to hold a casual conversation with you nor be around you at all times.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402007": "It is possible that being your knight is not in my destiny.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402008": "Why are you nitpicking again, Leyn?",
  "str_quest_chat_26402009": "You are you. Why can't you just be yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_26402010": "But you do not like what I am right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402011": "When did I ever say that?",
  "str_quest_chat_26402012": "You said I am too uptight and overzealous.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402013": "Yes, you do have those tendencies, Leyn...",
  "str_quest_chat_26402014": "But that doesn't mean I don't like you!",
  "str_quest_chat_26402015": "Who would be friends with someone they don't like?",
  "str_quest_chat_26402016": "But...",
  "str_quest_chat_26402017": "Stop it!",
  "str_quest_chat_26402018": "Any more deprecation and I'll get mad!",
  "str_quest_chat_26402019": "I am terribly sorry. I shall say no more.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402020": "Any other questions?",
  "str_quest_chat_26402021": "No...",
  "str_quest_chat_26402022": "Even though I lectured...",
  "str_quest_chat_26402023": "I was not perfect, myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402024": "I shouldn't criticize your behaviors.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402025": "Even when you asked for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402026": "It shouldn't be that way between friends.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402027": "Henceforth, you can just be who you are!",
  "str_quest_chat_26402028": "Then, may I still be your knight? Or, being your friend is the only option?",
  "str_quest_chat_26402029": "You should decide that yourself, Leyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402030": "I've decided.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402031": "If you'd rather be my knight...",
  "str_quest_chat_26402032": "I can respect that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402033": "Thank you...",
  "str_quest_chat_26402034": "But I won't change my attitude toward you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402035": "I'll still see and treat you as a friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_26402036": "Oh... If that is what you wish, I shall gladly accept as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_26402037": "Glad we worked that out, my friend!",
  "str_quest_chat_26402038": "Yes, Leyn the Knight shall serve by your side!",
  "str_quest_chat_26403001": "Sorry to interrupt you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26403002": "Has a letter meant for me been sent to you by mistake?",
  "str_quest_chat_26403003": "Let me see...",
  "str_quest_chat_26403004": "There really is a letter! The envelope is pink, and it has a faint sweet fragrance.",
  "str_quest_chat_26403005": "... Yes, that's the one.",
  "str_quest_chat_26403006": "I'll bring it to you. You don't need to be so polite to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26403007": "... I understand. I'll wait for you in the Cafe.",
  "str_quest_chat_26403999": "I better take this letter to Leyn now!",
  "str_quest_chat_26441001": "Hello, I am Leyn, a judge from Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441002": "But I shall suspend that identity here in favor of working for you as an individual.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441003": "However, that does not mean I will stop serving justice.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441004": "I shall tolerate no unfairness or injustice in any form.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441005": "I apologize in advance for any offense this may cause.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441006": "H-Hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441007": "I can tell you are a responsible, accountable judge.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441008": "I'm still young, so please be lenient...",
  "str_quest_chat_26441009": "Worry not, I do not oppress the innocent, no need to be afraid.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441010": "Let us wait no longer. May you inform me of my duty?",
  "str_quest_chat_26441011": "Adventure and gather resources, just like everybody else.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441012": "Help keep the Colossus in order and live in harmony.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441013": "Oh, I am not proficient in combat. I can only command.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441014": "I must rely on you for protection when we are out and about!",
  "str_quest_chat_26441015": "Other than the menial part, this position feels like... a knight to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441016": "A knight...? That sounds pretty cool!",
  "str_quest_chat_26441017": "Does that mean Leyn is my knight, then?",
  "str_quest_chat_26441018": "I guess Vice and Carleen count too, if you put it that way.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441019": "You would bestow such an honor on me...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26441020": "Yeah, because it does sound cool.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441021": "Let me think... From legal standpoint, if it is strictly unofficial...",
  "str_quest_chat_26441022": "It does not conflict with my position as a Lumopolis judge.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441023": "L-Leyn?",
  "str_quest_chat_26441024": "I am very grateful for the title.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441025": "Henceforth, I shall be a knight at your service.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441026": "I look forward to serving you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441027": "I-I look forward as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_26441028": "Wait, did I just do something I shouldn't...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26442001": "I heard someone has filed a complaint about me over cooperation issue. Is that true?",
  "str_quest_chat_26442002": "It wasn't a formal complaint.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442003": "It was just a quick talk...",
  "str_quest_chat_26442004": "From what I know, the comments included:",
  "str_quest_chat_26442005": "\"Enthusiastic and capable, but wants to cover everything.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_26442006": "\"Poor cooperation, fit for solo projects only.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_26442007": "\"Becomes aloof and detached after work is done.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_26442008": "Is that how you feel, too?",
  "str_quest_chat_26442009": "Somewhat.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442010": "Sorry that my eccentricity caused you trouble.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442011": "Not only did I bring you shame, but discomfort as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442012": "Uh, no, not at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442013": "Thank you for your solace.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442014": "Nevertheless, I still brought shame. I, Leyn, offer you my sincerest apologies.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442015": "No, no, it's not that bad, seriously!",
  "str_quest_chat_26442016": "But when I'm with you, Leyn...",
  "str_quest_chat_26442017": "You are too enthusiastic. Overzealous, even.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442018": "Because I am your knight here and it is my duty to protect you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442019": "And I firmly believe you will not oppose justice, thus my duty is never off-shift or over.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442020": "You ought to spread that passion around...",
  "str_quest_chat_26442021": "It would be much better to strike a balance.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442022": "... I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_26442023": "I shall endeavor toward that goal and not disappoint you. Therefore, may you give me some time?",
  "str_quest_chat_26442024": "Of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_26442025": "And don't be so formal. We're friends, after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443001": "There is something I would like you to know, regardless.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443002": "It is fine if you do not have the time to browse the terminal at the moment.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443003": "Please allow me to leave my honest opinion here.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443004": "I have grown much in your company.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443005": "I am starting to realize there are issues I must face.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443006": "We had a conversation about colleagues' criticism over my lack of cooperation.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443007": "The truth is, I am afraid of being with people and getting hurt.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443008": "Deep down, I always knew it and the reason behind it even more.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443009": "But I was too weak to deal with it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443010": "Now, however, I have taken the first step.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443011": "I just had a talk with Tina, my partner.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443012": "I confessed all my inner demons to her.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443013": "People always think the lethargic Tina depended on me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443014": "When the opposite is true. It is her who covered up my cowardice, for which she was constantly reprimanded.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443015": "I offered her my deepest apologies and sought no forgiveness.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443016": "Yet she still forgave me and was still willing to be my partner.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443017": "That was the first step I took. Small, perhaps even feeble.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443018": "But just that alone expended all my effort.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443019": "I believe I am still a long, long way from the finish line.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443020": "I wonder if you would be willing to wait for your knight.",
  "str_quest_chat_26443021": "Until the day I can truly hold my head high next to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451001": "Good morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451002": "Morning, Leyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451003": "I have not seen you this morning. May I ask where you are?",
  "str_quest_chat_26451004": "I'm still in bed...",
  "str_quest_chat_26451005": "It is late in the morning. Please rise.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451006": "I'm out running errands.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451007": "I see. Then I shall await your return here.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451008": "Is there anything you want to see me about, Leyn?",
  "str_quest_chat_26451009": "In your Colossus, I am your knight.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451010": "All activities shall revolve around your orders.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451011": "Without you present, I cannot begin a new day's work.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451012": "W-Well, that's overblown, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_26451013": "Whatever you want to do is fine, Leyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451014": "Whatever...? All right, I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451015": "I shall be disciplined and on standby.",
  "str_quest_chat_26451016": "You really are inflexible!",
  "str_quest_chat_26452001": "Hello. I have a question regarding the breakfast menu.",
  "str_quest_chat_26452002": "Miss Vice has appointed me to prepare breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_26452003": "Do you have any preferences?",
  "str_quest_chat_26452004": "I'm not picky. I'll eat anything yummy!",
  "str_quest_chat_26452005": "As long as it's not the so-called health food...",
  "str_quest_chat_26452006": "I know you're into wellness, Leyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_26452007": "But if the breakfast isn't tasty, it will ruin the mood for me all day!",
  "str_quest_chat_26452008": "Sorry, perhaps I wasn't up to the task.",
  "str_quest_chat_26452009": "And left you with a bad impression.",
  "str_quest_chat_26452010": "I feel I am somewhat skilled in the culinary arts...",
  "str_quest_chat_26452011": "How do you feel about toasted bread with my homemade jam?",
  "str_quest_chat_26452012": "I can adjust the flavor to your taste.",
  "str_quest_chat_26452013": "Please give me another chance to preserve my reputation.",
  "str_quest_chat_26452014": "Sorry, I think I was too rough on you...",
  "str_quest_chat_26452015": "And I believe everything you said.",
  "str_quest_chat_26452016": "The right to prepare breakfast is all yours, Chef Leyn!",
  "str_quest_chat_26452017": "I am grateful for your trust. I shall not disappoint you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453001": "Are you free at the moment?",
  "str_quest_chat_26453002": "I would like to ask you a question.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453003": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26453004": "Is my outfit weird?",
  "str_quest_chat_26453005": "No, but doesn't look Lumopolis-ish.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453006": "I see... It is clear now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453007": "Not at all, you look dashing!",
  "str_quest_chat_26453008": "Thank you for the compliment.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453009": "Matthieu brought it up at work today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453010": "He claimed my outfit is unbefitting the Hall of Justice.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453011": "Did you two have an issue at work?",
  "str_quest_chat_26453012": "We indeed have different opinions over a case.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453013": "I understand he was probably trying to mock me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453014": "But many people have also said the same.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453015": "They don't have anything better to do than to talk about what others wear.",
  "str_quest_chat_26453016": "If you were a noble, Leyn, no one would dare let out a peep!",
  "str_quest_chat_26453017": "You believe this is actually a caste issue, I take it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26453018": "That made sense. It is a form of injustice.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454001": "I am sorry to disturb you this early in the morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454002": "I would like to share a trivial matter with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454003": "Feel free to say whatever's on your mind!",
  "str_quest_chat_26454004": "Thank you. I shall then.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454005": "The flowers in my yard have blossomed. They are very pretty.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454006": "They were not growing well due to pests, and I thought they wouldn't make it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454007": "However, a few flowers were sighted today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454008": "My apologies. It was trivial, but I felt the urge to share it with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454009": "It's quite all right. I'm very happy that you told me, Leyn!",
  "str_quest_chat_26454010": "By the way, I never expected you to be into gardening!",
  "str_quest_chat_26454011": "Vice would lose her mind if she found out.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454012": "Is it so unexpected for me to have such a hobby...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26454013": "Yeah, it is!",
  "str_quest_chat_26454014": "For someone so pragmatic to like plants...",
  "str_quest_chat_26454015": "It has to be what they called a contradiction.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454016": "Contradiction? I do not quite understand the interpretation.",
  "str_quest_chat_26454017": "Anyway, take it as a compliment!",
  "str_quest_chat_26454018": "I see. Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461001": "My apologies for not being able to work on time today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461002": "It's all right. Did you run into problems?",
  "str_quest_chat_26461003": "Actually, yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461004": "I am investigating a theft for a lady noble.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461005": "When I went to her estate to investigate today, she seemed to ignore the case.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461006": "She would change subject and try to have tea with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461007": "Maybe she's into you...",
  "str_quest_chat_26461008": "She apparently was interested in me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461009": "But similar encounters seem to happen to me often.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461010": "In fact, it inspired my colleagues to give me unsavory nicknames.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461011": "What kind of nicknames?",
  "str_quest_chat_26461012": "The Heartbreak Judge... and that sort.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461013": "Oh, poor Leyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461014": "That is due to my inadequate performance.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461015": "You do not have to show sympathy.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461016": "I'm sorry, but that moniker...",
  "str_quest_chat_26461017": "Feel free to ridicule me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461018": "It's my fault for being unprofessional.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461019": "Which led to more trouble for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461020": "I deserve to be punished.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461021": "No, not at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_26461022": "Regardless, I will resolve the case as soon as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461023": "Please give me some time.",
  "str_quest_chat_26461024": "A problem for the good-looking, I see... You go, Leyn!",
  "str_quest_chat_26462001": "Good afternoon.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462002": "I would like to make a suggestion regarding meals on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462003": "Is it possible to note the flavor profile on every dish?",
  "str_quest_chat_26462004": "As to avoid certain awkward issues.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462005": "What do you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_26462006": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462007": "But what do you mean by awkward issues?",
  "str_quest_chat_26462008": "To be honest, I had a dish by mistake today and it did not suit my palate.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462009": "The problem lay not in the skill of the chef but...",
  "str_quest_chat_26462010": "But what?",
  "str_quest_chat_26462011": "It was a little spicy.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462012": "So you don't like spicy food, Leyn!",
  "str_quest_chat_26462013": "M-May I ask what is wrong with that?",
  "str_quest_chat_26462014": "I believe everyone has their own preferences.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462015": "No, no problem at all, it's just that you've always been resilient...",
  "str_quest_chat_26462016": "So I didn't figure you have such a weakness.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462017": "While it hurts to consume spicy food, I believe avoiding it has no impact on my resolve whatsoever!",
  "str_quest_chat_26462018": "... I will overcome it sooner or later!",
  "str_quest_chat_26462019": "Relax, I was only teasing!",
  "str_quest_chat_26462020": "I'll let Vice know.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462021": "So she can pass it on to the kitchen staff on duty.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462022": "Thank you for your understanding.",
  "str_quest_chat_26462023": "And please do not tease me next time...",
  "str_quest_chat_26481001": "Are you still awake?",
  "str_quest_chat_26481002": "Yeah, I've not gone to bed yet. Is there anything wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_26481003": "Please do not be alarmed, it is not official business.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481004": "I just want to discuss bedtime novels with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481005": "You like to read novels, Leyn?",
  "str_quest_chat_26481006": "You could say that, though only detective stories.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481007": "Primarily to broaden my horizons and learn investigation techniques.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481008": "It is a routine for me now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481009": "I would like to discuss something related to detective stories.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481010": "There is a subgenre in that called \"societist.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_26481011": "Compared to whodunit, it put greater emphasis on motives and exploration of our nature and societal problems.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481012": "I used to love this genre of detective stories.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481013": "But it has leaned more into absurdity recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481014": "It would first create a bizarre case.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481015": "Then blame every phenomenon on the illusions conjured through Luminatics.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481016": "Before focusing every last word on the motive stemmed from convoluted interpersonal relationships.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481017": "Such as the murderer is actually the illegitimate child of his own grandfather and an aunt, and the motive is that he is in love with his foster mother.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481018": "How can that even happen?",
  "str_quest_chat_26481019": "Hee... Well, it's possible that's what some readers love to see.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481020": "But you're obviously not one of them, Leyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481021": "No, I am not, and now I am too stressed to fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481022": "I must express my complaint for such banal writing to the author and the publisher!",
  "str_quest_chat_26481023": "I see you're serious about your books, Leyn.",
  "str_quest_chat_26481024": "You gotta learn to let go of the small stuff too!",
  "str_quest_chat_26482001": "Good evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482002": "Am I right in guessing you are not in bed yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_26482003": "Yeah, you're right.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482004": "Recently, I notice the circles are getting darker under your eyes.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482005": "Are you troubled? Or do you have emergency duty?",
  "str_quest_chat_26482006": "Nah, I just can't fall asleep, is all!",
  "str_quest_chat_26482007": "I'm too young to go to bed at this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482008": "Your age is exactly the reason why you need more rest. Burning the midnight oil stunts your growth.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482009": "As your knight, I cannot abide by that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482010": "Okay, I get it...",
  "str_quest_chat_26482011": "If you have problem falling asleep, I can make tea for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482012": "Or converse with you beforehand to help you relax.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482013": "Or find a doctor who can rectify the situation for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482014": "I will stay by you until you fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482015": "Whoa, time out!",
  "str_quest_chat_26482016": "Are you treating me like a baby, Leyn? That's not necessary!",
  "str_quest_chat_26482017": "But it is irresponsible to merely point out a problem without addressing it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482018": "I cannot do that as your knight.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482019": "Okay, okay, I'll come clean!",
  "str_quest_chat_26482020": "I've been staying up all night to play games.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482021": "I won't do that again, so don't tell anyone!",
  "str_quest_chat_26482022": "Especially Vice and Carleen!",
  "str_quest_chat_26482023": "Sure, as long as you turn in early.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482024": "Also, please do not try to brush me off, or I will be forced to confiscate the game machine.",
  "str_quest_chat_26482025": "Fine, Den Mother Leyn!",
  "str_quest_chat_26501001": "I heard you have a date tomorrow?",
  "str_quest_chat_26501002": "Yes. I'm trying to figure out what to wear, as we speak.",
  "str_quest_chat_26501003": "You have a very limited wardrobe, what choices can you ponder over?",
  "str_quest_chat_26501004": "Well, I can buy accessories too. Don't you run a clothing business?",
  "str_quest_chat_26501005": "I have time today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26501006": "You're coming with me to pick stuff out?",
  "str_quest_chat_26501007": "Of course, or I'll be afraid to know what outdated fashion you picked.",
  "str_quest_chat_26501008": "Is it a crime to not rag on me? Never mind then, you shouldn't go.",
  "str_quest_chat_26501009": "Do you think I'd waste the time and effort if you weren't a friend?",
  "str_quest_chat_26501010": "Hmm, that touched me for some reason.",
  "str_quest_chat_26501011": "Come on, let's get going.",
  "str_quest_chat_26501012": "Okay. See you at the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_26502001": "Ahem, my schedule is open tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_26502002": "Want to hang out, don't you? Fortunately, there's a sand surfing contest in Rediesel Wrench.",
  "str_quest_chat_26502003": "Should we sign up?",
  "str_quest_chat_26502004": "First of all, I don't go where the commoners flocked.",
  "str_quest_chat_26502005": "Second, I refuse to participate in activities that sound filthy and sweaty.",
  "str_quest_chat_26502006": "No, it's very fun. I even thought of a name for the team.",
  "str_quest_chat_26502007": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26502008": "Team PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_26502009": "But that has nothing to do with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26502010": "You're the only other member.",
  "str_quest_chat_26502011": "Fine, I'll go with you, but I'm not partaking in the race.",
  "str_quest_chat_26502012": "Okay. See you tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_26503001": "Excuse me, can you tell me what kind of gift I should prepare for a gathering with commoners?",
  "str_quest_chat_26503002": "It depends on the situation, but it's nowhere as complicated as it is for nobles like you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26503003": "In most cases, you can choose flowers, cakes, or small crafts.",
  "str_quest_chat_26503004": "I've prepared several gifts. Come and tell me what you think. I'm at the Bridge.",
  "str_quest_chat_26503999": "Go to the Bridge to help Matthieu pick a suitable gift.",
  "str_quest_chat_26541001": "Something's off.",
  "str_quest_chat_26541002": "What's the matter?",
  "str_quest_chat_26541003": "I handled three cases already today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26541004": "It is rare efficiency for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26541005": "I love taking on brain-racking cases.",
  "str_quest_chat_26541006": "But all three today were run-of-the-mill.",
  "str_quest_chat_26541007": "All that was required was some physical effort, and I would have ignored them usually.",
  "str_quest_chat_26541008": "But for unknown reasons, I've been excited about those cases lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_26541009": "Being motivated is a good thing.",
  "str_quest_chat_26541010": "I can live with that, but the biggest problem is...",
  "str_quest_chat_26541011": "I even got faster when I bathe!",
  "str_quest_chat_26541012": "I couldn't even enjoy my time in the tub!",
  "str_quest_chat_26541013": "No wonder we've been getting fewer complaints about the bathroom.",
  "str_quest_chat_26551001": "Still in bed?",
  "str_quest_chat_26551002": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_26551003": "I must report issues regarding breakfast.",
  "str_quest_chat_26551004": "What's wrong, not your taste?",
  "str_quest_chat_26551005": "I didn't eat.",
  "str_quest_chat_26551006": "Huh? Why not?",
  "str_quest_chat_26551007": "The dining sets were neither made of pure gold nor bejeweled.",
  "str_quest_chat_26551008": "So what's the problem?",
  "str_quest_chat_26551009": "Don't you think you ought to replace them?",
  "str_quest_chat_26551010": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_26551011": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_26552001": "If anyone come to see me, tell them I'm not in today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26552002": "What are you planning to do?",
  "str_quest_chat_26552003": "Read and think in peace, of course.",
  "str_quest_chat_26552004": "What if it's official business?",
  "str_quest_chat_26552005": "Unless it came personally from Lady Irridon...",
  "str_quest_chat_26552006": "Shove everything unto Pittman.",
  "str_quest_chat_26552007": "How did you ever make judge in the first place...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26552008": "That's because I'd allot time for quiet contemplation...",
  "str_quest_chat_26552009": "Instead of spending energy on tedious official business.",
  "str_quest_chat_26552010": "No, it's because you got Pittman to do the heavy lifting for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_26552011": "Oh... Well, I'll reward him with a gem badge!",
  "str_quest_chat_26552012": "That sounds virtually useless.",
  "str_quest_chat_26552013": "That is the point of gift-giving!",
  "str_quest_chat_26552014": "He could buy anything useful to him on his own.",
  "str_quest_chat_26552015": "That is nonsense, yet somehow convincing...",
  "str_quest_chat_26561001": "It's raining. What a terrible day.",
  "str_quest_chat_26561002": "I feel the same.",
  "str_quest_chat_26561003": "It's rare for us to agree.",
  "str_quest_chat_26561004": "I like raining days.",
  "str_quest_chat_26561005": "You have no taste at all.",
  "str_quest_chat_26561006": "Why do you hate raining days?",
  "str_quest_chat_26561007": "The rain and mud will dirty my clothes.",
  "str_quest_chat_26561008": "No wonder Loewe called you a neat freak.",
  "str_quest_chat_26561009": "I'm not a neat freak, I just prefer cleanliness.",
  "str_quest_chat_26561010": "Since you prefer cleanliness so much...",
  "str_quest_chat_26561011": "I'm sure you just can't stand the dining room being messy after lunch.",
  "str_quest_chat_26561012": "What? No one's cleaned it up yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_26561013": "Who is responsible for cleanup duty today?",
  "str_quest_chat_26561014": "Never mind. Let's do it together!",
  "str_quest_chat_26561015": "It's your turn today, isn't it? You better hurry!",
  "str_quest_chat_26561016": "Oops, busted...",
  "str_quest_chat_26562001": "I see a tissue box in the Lounge.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562002": "It's Vice's handiwork.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562003": "It's ugly. We must throw that away.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562004": "No. Even though the craftsmanship is so-so...",
  "str_quest_chat_26562005": "Vice still put a lot of effort into it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562006": "It's useless and only takes up space.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562007": "We can put napkins or tissues in it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562008": "Useless is you putting gemstones all over the tank.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562009": "We can't even see the water level.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562010": "Beautiful things deserve praises even if they're useless.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562011": "Ugly things deserve contempt even if they're useful.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562012": "Got it. I'll take the gems off the tank right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26562013": "Hey, it took me a lot of effort to put them up, you fool!",
  "str_quest_chat_26581001": "Still up?",
  "str_quest_chat_26581002": "Yeah. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_26581003": "I have a few propositions regarding policies in the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_26581004": "Why would we make changes?",
  "str_quest_chat_26581005": "To improve our lives in the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_26581006": "Okay, let's hear it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26581007": "First: All access to public venues must be scheduled.",
  "str_quest_chat_26581008": "What do you mean?",
  "str_quest_chat_26581009": "Nobles and commoners must access them at separate times to avoid sharing the same space.",
  "str_quest_chat_26581010": "Rejected.",
  "str_quest_chat_26581011": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_26581012": "Because I have the final say here.",
  "str_quest_chat_26581013": "Anything else?",
  "str_quest_chat_26581014": "I have nine more proposals...",
  "str_quest_chat_26581015": "Stop. They're all rejected.",
  "str_quest_chat_26581016": "Why you...!",
  "str_quest_chat_26581017": "Hee, it's fun chatting with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_26582001": "Here I am, a fresh-smelling genius!",
  "str_quest_chat_26582002": "You've done bathing?",
  "str_quest_chat_26582003": "How do you know? Were you watching me?",
  "str_quest_chat_26582004": "I'd rather poke my eyes out than watch you in the tub...",
  "str_quest_chat_26582005": "I doubt it...",
  "str_quest_chat_26582006": "You're giddy and stop nitpicking every time after taking a bath.",
  "str_quest_chat_26582007": "I am not picky at all. It's all normal everyday demands!",
  "str_quest_chat_26582008": "What's normal about demanding gems on your laundry hamper?",
  "str_quest_chat_26582009": "Forget it, I don't feel like arguing with you today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26582010": "For bathing under the night sky is just too wonderful!",
  "str_quest_chat_26582011": "I suggest you take one too, then go curl up in a warm bed.",
  "str_quest_chat_26582012": "That's a good suggestion. Proposition accepted.",
  "str_quest_chat_26601001": "Do you feel something different right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_26601002": "I do! It's sweltering inside the Colossus, isn't it? We must be passing over the Rediesel Desert or something.",
  "str_quest_chat_26601003": "So you feel it too? Looks like I've gotten even stronger now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26601004": "\"Stronger\"? What are you up to, Hati?",
  "str_quest_chat_26601005": "I've been training to make my flames even more ferocious.",
  "str_quest_chat_26601006": "What?! You're starting fires on the Colossus?!",
  "str_quest_chat_26601007": "In one of the more open corridors, yeah. There's no one around, I promise.",
  "str_quest_chat_26601008": "But that's still risky, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_26601009": "I know your flames can't hurt you, but Soroz is a different story...",
  "str_quest_chat_26601010": "Relax. I promise I'll stay calm and keep my flames under control.",
  "str_quest_chat_26601011": "I'm still a little worried...",
  "str_quest_chat_26601012": "I understand. I'll put a stop to my training for now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26602001": "Got any workouts planned for today?",
  "str_quest_chat_26602002": "Well, I wouldn't say I have a workout planned or anything, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_26602003": "Wanna go for a run with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_26602004": "I still haven't fully recovered from my last few workouts, so I can't run very fast right now...",
  "str_quest_chat_26602005": "That's fine, we can take it slow today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26602006": "How slow?",
  "str_quest_chat_26602007": "Slow enough to look like we're walking.",
  "str_quest_chat_26602008": "Then wouldn't we just be going for a walk...?",
  "str_quest_chat_26602009": "Would you rather go for a walk, instead?",
  "str_quest_chat_26602010": "Hahaha! It's fine, you don't need to accommodate me or anything. You go on your run, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_26602011": "But aren't friends supposed to accommodate each other?",
  "str_quest_chat_26602012": "Yeah, I guess you're right. Let's go work out together, then!",
  "str_quest_chat_26603001": "I was in the cafeteria just now. The others were saying that you prepared the assorted vegetables yourself?",
  "str_quest_chat_26603002": "Yep! I've been known to dabble in the culinary arts from time to time. Did you have some?",
  "str_quest_chat_26603003": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_26603004": "Aw, I was really hoping to hear your thoughts on it!",
  "str_quest_chat_26603005": "You wanted me to try it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26603006": "Of course! I'd love it if everyone got a chance to taste my cooking!",
  "str_quest_chat_26603007": "Wow... There are all kinds of vegetables in this. There's even red cabbage...",
  "str_quest_chat_26603008": "Yep! I gathered ingredients from all over just for this dish! It wasn't easy to make, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_26603009": "Hmm... Some of these look really green, while others are completely black...",
  "str_quest_chat_26603010": "Oh, the black veggies are probably burnt. Don't eat those.",
  "str_quest_chat_26603011": "The green ones should be safe to eat, though!",
  "str_quest_chat_26603012": "Uh... Alright, I guess I'll have some.",
  "str_quest_chat_26603013": "Okay! Remember to give me some feedback on my cooking when you're done!",
  "str_quest_chat_26603014": "Sure thing. If I survive, that is...",
  "str_quest_chat_26604001": "Are you free today?",
  "str_quest_chat_26604002": "Sure. What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_26604003": "I'd like to wander around Umbraton with you. I have lived here for so many years but have never explored the place.",
  "str_quest_chat_26604004": "I can, but you should know that I'm unfamiliar with Umbraton. I won't be able to introduce you to anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_26604005": "That's why I want to go with you. The fun of exploration will be lost if you're too familiar with Umbraton.",
  "str_quest_chat_26604006": "We can walk around freely since neither of us knows Umbraton that well.",
  "str_quest_chat_26604007": "Let's go then!",
  "str_quest_chat_26604999": "Hati wants to invite you to wander around Umbraton with her. Go look for her in the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_26641001": "Are you serious?",
  "str_quest_chat_26641002": "You're actually willing to let me live on the Colossus?",
  "str_quest_chat_26641003": "Of course! Why's that so surprising to you?",
  "str_quest_chat_26641004": "But everything looks so shiny and high-tech here.",
  "str_quest_chat_26641005": "I-It's just the place where we live, Hati. But thanks for saying so!",
  "str_quest_chat_26641006": "So what do you need me to do around here?",
  "str_quest_chat_26641007": "Guard duty?",
  "str_quest_chat_26641008": "I could inspect anyone who wants to come aboard, so no troublemakers manage to sneak in.",
  "str_quest_chat_26641009": "That's alright, Hati. Most people can't board the Colossus so easily, though we do have our fair share of troublemakers here already...",
  "str_quest_chat_26641010": "What about providing lighting?",
  "str_quest_chat_26641011": "My blue flames could help people find their way at night.",
  "str_quest_chat_26641012": "The Fireflies already provide lighting aboard the Colossus, so no need to worry about that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26641013": "So what good am I, then? Why would you let me onboard if I can't do anything for you?",
  "str_quest_chat_26641014": "Because you're my friend?",
  "str_quest_chat_26641015": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_26641016": "What is it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26641017": "Nothing. Thanks.",
  "str_quest_chat_26642001": "How much do repairs cost around here? I'd like to pitch in.",
  "str_quest_chat_26642002": "Why? Did something happen?",
  "str_quest_chat_26642003": "I was in the kitchen just now, and they were complaining that the stove's flames were too low.",
  "str_quest_chat_26642004": "So I tried to use my flames to help them out, but I ended up burning a hole through the pot instead.",
  "str_quest_chat_26642005": "Did anyone get hurt?",
  "str_quest_chat_26642006": "No, but the stove and everything around it is covered in soot.",
  "str_quest_chat_26642007": "It's fine, as long as no one got hurt.",
  "str_quest_chat_26642008": "It's strange. My flames have been feeling a little uncontrollable lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_26642009": "Whenever I try to use even a tiny flame, I end up unleashing a huge blaze.",
  "str_quest_chat_26642010": "Maybe you should avoid using your flames on the Colossus for a little while?",
  "str_quest_chat_26642011": "I'll send you a bill for the pot later. Just remember to clean up the kitchen later, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_26642012": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_26643001": "What kind of propulsion system does the Colossus use, a combustion engine? If so, want me to give it a little extra push with my flames?",
  "str_quest_chat_26643002": "N-No thanks! Just keep away from the engine, please!",
  "str_quest_chat_26643003": "Not sure why, but lately it feels like I have this huge power welling up inside of me. I just have nowhere to let it out.",
  "str_quest_chat_26643004": "That's fine, as long as you don't let it out on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_26643005": "Would you relax? I've never done anything like that before!",
  "str_quest_chat_26643006": "Oh yeah? Who was it that nearly burned down the entire kitchen a while back?",
  "str_quest_chat_26643007": "You mean you don't remember? It was me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26643008": "Of course I remember!",
  "str_quest_chat_26643009": "My firepower was a lot weaker back then, though. I bet I could do the same to the entire Colossus now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26643010": "Are you trying to get kicked out or something?!",
  "str_quest_chat_26643011": "Not at all! So I can't let off even a tiny flame right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_26643012": "No way!",
  "str_quest_chat_26643013": "It's okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_26651001": "So many vegetables.",
  "str_quest_chat_26651002": "Oh, you mean in the cafeteria?",
  "str_quest_chat_26651003": "I hear today's breakfast includes a bunch of veggies.",
  "str_quest_chat_26651004": "I hate vegetables, especially red cabbage. My mom used to force me to eat it all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_26651005": "I would put it in my mouth and then spit it out while she wasn't looking.",
  "str_quest_chat_26651006": "Hahahaha! But vegetables really are an important part of anyone's diet, you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_26651007": "I know, which is why I'm slowly trying to get used to them.",
  "str_quest_chat_26651008": "So why not give today's breakfast a chance? Who knows, you might even like it!",
  "str_quest_chat_26651009": "I, uh... I haven't showered today, so I can't eat vegetables right now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26651010": "... What kind of excuse is that?",
  "str_quest_chat_26652001": "You in the cafeteria right now?",
  "str_quest_chat_26652002": "I am. What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_26652003": "I'm just walking around in the area.",
  "str_quest_chat_26652004": "Going for a walk after breakfast, huh? That's a pretty healthy habit to keep!",
  "str_quest_chat_26652005": "I haven't eaten yet. There were too many people in the cafeteria just now, so I left.",
  "str_quest_chat_26652006": "Really? Because I've been here for a while, and there aren't that many people here.",
  "str_quest_chat_26652007": "Right. Which is why I'm waiting for everyone to leave before I go back in.",
  "str_quest_chat_26653001": "Did I see you in the Corridor just now?",
  "str_quest_chat_26653002": "Maybe? I woke up early today, so I decided to get some exercise in.",
  "str_quest_chat_26653003": "Do you have any workout routines?",
  "str_quest_chat_26653004": "Eh, I like to go running in the mornings from time to time.",
  "str_quest_chat_26653005": "We should go for a run!",
  "str_quest_chat_26653006": "Let's do something else!",
  "str_quest_chat_26653007": "No thanks. I like to enjoy the peace of the morning by myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_26653008": "I understand. Sorry to bother!",
  "str_quest_chat_26654001": "The weather's beautiful today. Perfect for doing some training.",
  "str_quest_chat_26654002": "What do you feel like working on today?",
  "str_quest_chat_26654003": "Flame control. I have to train regularly if I want to keep my flames from going berserk.",
  "str_quest_chat_26654004": "I think it's impressive that you can still be so diligent with your training despite being so naturally gifted.",
  "str_quest_chat_26654005": "Power like this comes with a huge responsibility, you know.",
  "str_quest_chat_26654006": "My flames can easily hurt other people, so I have to do my best to keep them under control.",
  "str_quest_chat_26655001": "Good morning. Got any plans for today?",
  "str_quest_chat_26655002": "I think I'm gonna take it easy today, maybe play some games?",
  "str_quest_chat_26655003": "You want to play a word game with me?",
  "str_quest_chat_26655004": "Does it involve guessing a word or a phrase? I'm not too good at those.",
  "str_quest_chat_26655005": "It does. Games like this help me keep calm and stay focused.",
  "str_quest_chat_26655006": "Do you have some sort of strategy for playing word games?",
  "str_quest_chat_26655007": "Just lots of thinking and intuition. The most important thing is to look for clues wherever you can.",
  "str_quest_chat_26655008": "I see. That sounds like a peaceful and productive way to spend time!",
  "str_quest_chat_26661001": "Today's lunch was really good.",
  "str_quest_chat_26661002": "What did you have?",
  "str_quest_chat_26661003": "Stewed ribs.",
  "str_quest_chat_26661004": "The lean-to-fat ratio was perfect, and the meat was nice and tender. Best of all, the sauce was perfect, which is probably the hardest thing to get right with stewed ribs.",
  "str_quest_chat_26661005": "Alright, alright, I'll take your word for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26661006": "What, don't you like stewed ribs?",
  "str_quest_chat_26661007": "Are you kidding? I'm drooling all over my shirt over here...",
  "str_quest_chat_26681001": "I might be a little late coming back to the Colossus today. What time do you lock up for the night?",
  "str_quest_chat_26681002": "Hahaha! I don't really \"lock up\" the Colossus. You can come back whenever you want.",
  "str_quest_chat_26681003": "Anyways, is there a reason you're coming back late today?",
  "str_quest_chat_26681004": "I ran into a bunch of cute kids at a park today. They really liked my blue flames.",
  "str_quest_chat_26681005": "So I promised them that I'd show them some tricks with my flames later this evening.",
  "str_quest_chat_26681006": "You're gonna put on a show for those kids?",
  "str_quest_chat_26681007": "Yeah, I guess you could say that.",
  "str_quest_chat_26681008": "Give me a few minutes! I'll head over there right now!",
  "str_quest_chat_26682001": "Any plans for tonight?",
  "str_quest_chat_26682002": "Just gonna do some reading. What about you?",
  "str_quest_chat_26682003": "What a coincidence, I'm reading with Kelpy as we speak.",
  "str_quest_chat_26682004": "Kelpy?",
  "str_quest_chat_26682005": "It's a little, stuffed horse that my mom made for me as a kid.",
  "str_quest_chat_26682006": "Oh, you mean the one you always carry at your waist? I remember it now.",
  "str_quest_chat_26682007": "Yeah, but that's enough chatting for now. I still have to finish reading this story to Kelpy.",
  "str_quest_chat_26682008": "Uh, okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_26683001": "I hear they're putting on a show in Umbraton tonight. Wanna go check it out?",
  "str_quest_chat_26683002": "What's it about?",
  "str_quest_chat_26683003": "The posters say that it's the story of a group of kids who go on an island adventure.",
  "str_quest_chat_26683004": "Sounds pretty interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_26683005": "Cool, then I'll go buy you a ticket, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_26683006": "Sounds pretty boring.",
  "str_quest_chat_26683007": "That's fine, I'll just go by myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_26683008": "So you like those kinds of stories, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_26683009": "Yeah. Children are so pure and innocent, it makes me want to protect them even more.",
  "str_quest_chat_26683010": "That's true. I totally agree.",
  "str_quest_chat_26684001": "I noticed you have a lot of books here on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_26684002": "Yep! Feel free to browse them anytime, Hati.",
  "str_quest_chat_26684003": "What kinds of books do you like to read?",
  "str_quest_chat_26684004": "Books with powerful stories.",
  "str_quest_chat_26684005": "Books with professional knowledge.",
  "str_quest_chat_26684006": "I happen to like reading detective novels myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_26684007": "Why's that?",
  "str_quest_chat_26684008": "I think it's fun to guess the outcome of the story.",
  "str_quest_chat_26684009": "I feel so accomplished when I manage to guess the ending before finishing the entire story.",
  "str_quest_chat_26684010": "I guess, but doesn't that sort of kill your motivation to finish the book?",
  "str_quest_chat_26685001": "Let's give each other some riddles before bed. What do you say?",
  "str_quest_chat_26685002": "Sure, you first.",
  "str_quest_chat_26685003": "What's something you can't see with your eyes?",
  "str_quest_chat_26685004": "Air.",
  "str_quest_chat_26685005": "Dreams.",
  "str_quest_chat_26685006": "Heh, not bad. I honestly never thought of that...",
  "str_quest_chat_26685007": "So what was your answer?",
  "str_quest_chat_26685008": "Unspoken words.",
  "str_quest_chat_26685009": "I mean you're not wrong, but that sounds a little depressing, don't you think?",
  "str_quest_chat_26701001": "Hey PlayerName, where do you like to go for vacations?",
  "str_quest_chat_26701002": "Vacations?",
  "str_quest_chat_26701003": "Well, I already spend most of my time traveling all over the world to gather parts for Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_26701004": "To me, that's basically like being on vacation all the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_26701005": "I see... Your days must be so full of fun and excitement, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_26701006": "Not really. In fact, there are plenty of times when I actually feel bored...",
  "str_quest_chat_26701007": "My parents usually invite me back to the family manor during the holidays.",
  "str_quest_chat_26701008": "But I always end up spending most of my time studying law in my room.",
  "str_quest_chat_26701009": "Does that really count as a vacation?",
  "str_quest_chat_26701010": "It does!",
  "str_quest_chat_26701011": "You're free to choose how you spend your holidays, Kristen.",
  "str_quest_chat_26701012": "It doesn't.",
  "str_quest_chat_26701013": "I think you should spend more time outside while you're on vacation, Kristen.",
  "str_quest_chat_26701014": "Heh, so you think so too, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26701015": "I suppose my way of spending the holidays is a little lacking.",
  "str_quest_chat_26701016": "Sometimes I like to relax by tidying things up. Like reorganizing my bookshelf, for example!",
  "str_quest_chat_26701017": "I feel such a profound sense of peace after seeing all of my books in perfect order.",
  "str_quest_chat_26701018": "I think I can relate. It's probably because you like keeping things in order, right Kristen?",
  "str_quest_chat_26701019": "Yeah! There's nothing like the feeling of bringing order to a messy situation...",
  "str_quest_chat_26702001": "I'm going to see the orchestra later tonight.",
  "str_quest_chat_26702002": "Do you know much about orchestras, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26702003": "A little.",
  "str_quest_chat_26702004": "It's basically a bunch of musicians playing as a group, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_26702005": "Not really.",
  "str_quest_chat_26702006": "I've been to a few concerts, but I don't really get how an orchestra work.",
  "str_quest_chat_26702007": "I guess there must be lots of different types of concerts, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_26702008": "That's right! But these days, the most popular performances in Lumopolis are done by orchestras!",
  "str_quest_chat_26702009": "Even operas have started incorporating some of their aspects into their shows.",
  "str_quest_chat_26702010": "As for me, I prefer the opera over simply listening to the music.",
  "str_quest_chat_26702011": "The arias, as well as the stories told by the actors, make for a much more immersive and multifaceted experience!",
  "str_quest_chat_26702012": "If that's the case, why are you still going to a concert and not an opera?",
  "str_quest_chat_26702013": "Seeing a worthwhile opera isn't as simple as you may think.",
  "str_quest_chat_26702014": "Orchestral performances, however, always maintain a decent level of quality!",
  "str_quest_chat_26702015": "I'll tell you more about it later! The show's about to begin!",
  "str_quest_chat_26703001": "Do you remember the opera ticket I gave you? It's today, so don't forget to watch it.",
  "str_quest_chat_26703002": "Yeah, I remember. I'm just about to go!",
  "str_quest_chat_26703003": "Good. I'll be going to the opera house later tonight. So enjoy the show first, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_26703004": "Aren't you coming with me, Kristen?",
  "str_quest_chat_26703005": "I'm sorry, there's something I need to do at the Hall of Justice first. I'll be there a little later.",
  "str_quest_chat_26703006": "Okay...",
  "str_quest_chat_26703999": "Get ready to go from the Colossus to the opera house.",
  "str_quest_chat_26741001": "Every so often, I like to make sure that my spearplay is still up to standards.",
  "str_quest_chat_26741002": "The first thing I test is my accuracy.",
  "str_quest_chat_26741003": "A person's two eyes sees things slightly differently, so relying on sight alone can sometimes result in misjudgment.",
  "str_quest_chat_26741004": "So how exactly do you test your accuracy, Kristen?",
  "str_quest_chat_26741005": "One way to eliminate visual errors is to avoid using your eyes altogether.",
  "str_quest_chat_26741006": "Like a spearfisher, I can close my eyes and sense the flow of water to determine my target's position and strike.",
  "str_quest_chat_26741007": "Right now, if I close my eyes, I can accurately strike nearby targets without looking.",
  "str_quest_chat_26741008": "While distance increases the probability of errors, I'm already at a level where no criminal is safe from my lance.",
  "str_quest_chat_26741009": "You really got all your bases covered, Kristen...",
  "str_quest_chat_26741010": "Criminals aren't merely limited to unlawful offenders, either. Eclipsites are just as guilty.",
  "str_quest_chat_26741011": "In order to defend justice, I must continue to get stronger.",
  "str_quest_chat_26741012": "As a judge, this is my sacred duty...",
  "str_quest_chat_26742001": "I discovered a few new uses for my lance recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_26742002": "New uses for a weapon, huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_26742003": "That's right! Everything in the world has an intended purpose...",
  "str_quest_chat_26742004": "But that doesn't mean you can't use them in different ways!",
  "str_quest_chat_26742005": "For example?",
  "str_quest_chat_26742006": "My Lance of the Torrents can also double as an incomparably elegant musical instrument!",
  "str_quest_chat_26742007": "By controlling the flow of water with my lance, I can produce all kinds of sounds.",
  "str_quest_chat_26742008": "If I had a musical score to reference, I bet I could play something truly beautiful...",
  "str_quest_chat_26742009": "A crisp yet rushing resonance not unlike that of a piano and violin concerto!",
  "str_quest_chat_26742010": "Naturally, I should be able to do it if I can learn to control the intensity of the sounds.",
  "str_quest_chat_26742011": "I don't know which is more impressive sometimes, Kristen: your lance skills or your musical talent...",
  "str_quest_chat_26751001": "Good morning! How did you sleep last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_26751002": "I slept fine. What about you, Kristen?",
  "str_quest_chat_26751003": "I slept great, so I came to the Hall of Justice a little earlier today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26751004": "I've already started working, and things are proceeding very smoothly!",
  "str_quest_chat_26751005": "Looks like you've really gotten the hang of your trainee duties, Kristen!",
  "str_quest_chat_26751006": "Although I still have much to learn, my seniors all take very good care of me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26751007": "I hope I can handle even more cases someday soon, so I can repay them for all of their help!",
  "str_quest_chat_26751008": "I know you'll get there!",
  "str_quest_chat_26752001": "I heard the birds singing this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_26752002": "It was a song of pure freedom.",
  "str_quest_chat_26752003": "I think that's something very characteristic of all birds.",
  "str_quest_chat_26752004": "I agree. It's such a wonderful melody, as though they are calling to all of nature...",
  "str_quest_chat_26752005": "And welcoming the start of a brand new day. Do you like their singing too, Navigator?",
  "str_quest_chat_26752006": "I like them!",
  "str_quest_chat_26752007": "I don't care for them.",
  "str_quest_chat_26752008": "Everyone has a right to like or dislike whatever they please.",
  "str_quest_chat_26752009": "I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to follow your heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_26753001": "Good morning! How did you sleep last night?",
  "str_quest_chat_26753002": "I'm still a little sleepy...",
  "str_quest_chat_26753003": "I'm sorry! I didn't wake you up, did I?",
  "str_quest_chat_26753004": "Not at all! I just had a rough dream last night, is all.",
  "str_quest_chat_26753005": "Was it a nightmare, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26753006": "It's probably because I've been a little too tired lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_26753007": "Perhaps you should set some of your duties aside and take some time to rest?",
  "str_quest_chat_26753008": "Success starts with a healthy body and a sound mind, you know!",
  "str_quest_chat_26762001": "I've already had three cups of coffee just this morning.",
  "str_quest_chat_26762002": "The Hall of Justice keeps us far busier than I could have ever imagined...",
  "str_quest_chat_26762003": "Well, it's not like crimes follow a schedule or anything. Maybe you're just in the middle of a busy time?",
  "str_quest_chat_26762004": "Who knows? Maybe after this period passes, you'll have a little more time to relax?",
  "str_quest_chat_26762005": "You make a good point, PlayerName. I just hope I can make it through this time...",
  "str_quest_chat_26762006": "Sometimes, it feels like my trainee days are never going to end!",
  "str_quest_chat_26763001": "PlayerName! Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_26763002": "Good afternoon!",
  "str_quest_chat_26763003": "Have you eaten lunch yet?",
  "str_quest_chat_26763004": "I have.",
  "str_quest_chat_26763005": "I haven't.",
  "str_quest_chat_26763006": "Eating meals at regular times throughout the day helps to maintain peak performance.",
  "str_quest_chat_26763007": "Remember to take good care of your body!",
  "str_quest_chat_26766001": "Good afternoon. It's such a nice day, isn't it?",
  "str_quest_chat_26766002": "Hey, Kristen. You look like you're in a good mood.",
  "str_quest_chat_26766003": "Do I usually seem like I'm in a bad mood?",
  "str_quest_chat_26766004": "Uh... N-No, it's just your tone seems especially cheery today.",
  "str_quest_chat_26766005": "Don't be so nervous! I'm only joking!",
  "str_quest_chat_26766006": "I finished a whole slew of cases today without too much trouble, which is probably why I'm in such a good mood!",
  "str_quest_chat_26766007": "Oh, yeah? That's great to hear, Kristen! For a second there, I thought I said something I shouldn't have...",
  "str_quest_chat_26766008": "Well, it did give me something to think about... Do I really look that serious to you most of the time?",
  "str_quest_chat_26781001": "Today's work is finally over!",
  "str_quest_chat_26781002": "Were you pretty busy today, Kristen?",
  "str_quest_chat_26781003": "Well, I managed to finish all my work on time, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_26781004": "But what?",
  "str_quest_chat_26781005": "Tina says that I'm taking everything far too seriously, and that I'm placing unnecessary stress on myself when handling cases.",
  "str_quest_chat_26781006": "She also says that this will likely affect my ability to perform my duties in the long-term.",
  "str_quest_chat_26781007": "Sounds like she has a point.",
  "str_quest_chat_26781008": "I see. I'll try to make some adjustments before tackling my work tomorrow, then!",
  "str_quest_chat_26782001": "Are you asleep, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_26782002": "I haven't.",
  "str_quest_chat_26782003": "When I stare into the distance from aboard the Colossus, I can't help but feel a sense of loneliness sometimes.",
  "str_quest_chat_26782004": "The silence of the night tends to amplify these kinds of feelings, which makes it all the harder to fall asleep.",
  "str_quest_chat_26782005": "So if you ever have trouble sleeping, you can always reach out to me.",
  "str_quest_chat_26782006": "I'll do my best to be at your side and listen to anything you have to say.",
  "str_quest_chat_26782007": "Thank you, Kristen.",
  "str_quest_chat_30101001": "That was such a tough battle!",
  "str_quest_chat_30101002": "We managed to win against such a powerful enemy. This was unimaginable in the past...",
  "str_quest_chat_30101003": "No matter what, thank you for your guidance and protection, or for helping us become strong enough to protect ourselves instead!",
  "str_quest_chat_30101004": "It's better to help one another in the face of crisis.",
  "str_quest_chat_30101005": "I also need to thank you for giving us that Lumamber and other materials.",
  "str_quest_chat_30101006": "You're welcome! We should be helping each other in times of crisis!",
  "str_quest_chat_30101007": "Just think of the Lumamber as our fare for traveling on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_30101008": "Your fare? According to what I read in the database, this refers to the payment for the use of public transportation. Am I right?",
  "str_quest_chat_30101009": "Yes, that's right. As the owner of the Colossus, have you thought about the pricing?",
  "str_quest_chat_30101010": "What's pricing?",
  "str_quest_chat_30101011": "Pricing means approximately how much you intend to charge for someone to ride on the Colossus once.",
  "str_quest_chat_30101012": "In that case, the Lumamber just now is enough.",
  "str_quest_chat_30101013": "I understand... I won't be leaving the Colossus for now!",
  "str_quest_chat_30101014": "Why?",
  "str_quest_chat_30101015": "Because I'll have to pay you again to get back on if I leave, and it's very expensive!",
  "str_quest_chat_30101016": "I won't charge you any money. It was just a special case.",
  "str_quest_chat_30101017": "You're right!",
  "str_quest_chat_30102001": "Hi, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_30102002": "Hello, Ms. Blanc.",
  "str_quest_chat_30102003": "I'm sorry. There are times when I leave the Colossus for a while to attend to some official business.",
  "str_quest_chat_30102004": "You don't need to apologize. Thank you for your support.",
  "str_quest_chat_30102005": "You're welcome. It's because I received your message that this trip has become much more interesting than expected.",
  "str_quest_chat_30102006": "Thank you for taking care of me and explaining to me, and for giving me the chance to experience an interesting journey.",
  "str_quest_chat_30102007": "However, we'll see each other again. As long as I have no official duties, I will come back to this Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_30102008": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_30102009": "Don't mention it—after all, you might be a rising star in the future. Speaking of which, maybe we should put off all official business...",
  "str_quest_chat_30201001": "You are PlayerName, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_30201002": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201003": "Good, I like your straightforward, simple answer.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201004": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201005": "Don't play games with me because I'm not actually confirming your name with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201006": "I just randomly said that to let you know that I've remembered you.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201007": "What do you want actually?",
  "str_quest_chat_30201008": "You have more backbone than I thought, or should I say you're more useful than I thought.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201009": "Well, my backbone isn't for you to take advantage of.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201010": "How interesting. I was thinking of kidnapping you, but someone got in my way.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201011": "Yes, I remember you ran pretty quickly.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201012": "Don't misunderstand—I'm letting you off this time out of the goodness of my heart.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201013": "The goodness of your heart? You kidnap people out of the goodness of your heart?",
  "str_quest_chat_30201014": "Haha! You look like you have a lot on your plate.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201015": "It's none of your business.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201016": "Don't treat me like an outsider. Treat this as a favor that you can pay back in the future.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201017": "When that happens, you'll be coming with me whether you want to or not.",
  "str_quest_chat_30201018": "This is our agreement, understood?!",
  "str_quest_chat_30201019": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202001": "Hey! How was it? This final show was awesome, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_30202002": "... I don't know what to say to you anymore, Mr. Charon.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202003": "Just offer me your praise and call me Charon!",
  "str_quest_chat_30202004": "After all, I'm a romantic who fills life with unexpected surprises!",
  "str_quest_chat_30202005": "Hmm... But my lines aren't rehearsed to perfection.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202006": "... Fine then, Charon.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202007": "Your reaction is slightly frosty.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202008": "It doesn't matter though. I'll take the survivors who are in urgent need of medical care to the nearest Undercity.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202009": "I'll meet up with you later.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202010": "Also, remember to compensate Undercity 28 for its losses!!",
  "str_quest_chat_30202011": "This matter will eventually be pinned on your head, so don't you forget it!",
  "str_quest_chat_30202012": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202013": "How cold of you. You should hang out with Vice more, then maybe you'll become more enlivened!",
  "str_quest_chat_30202014": "Okay then, I'll do my best to take responsibility for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202015": "I'm afraid you'll have to give up everything you have. The resources there are...",
  "str_quest_chat_30202016": "Forget it—I won't hold you accountable for now since I'm also partly responsible.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202017": "Besides, is there anything that a handsome man like me can't resolve by apologizing?",
  "str_quest_chat_30202018": "... If we lose contact after I go apologize, you should just forget about me.",
  "str_quest_chat_30202019": "—Message from The Acheron Ferryman, the man who burned down the Undercity and ended the lives of the Eclipsites, the howling messenger, Charon!",
  "str_quest_chat_30301001": "Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301002": "I received a second briefing about Undercity 28 from Charon.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301003": "He stressed that this incident had nothing to do with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301004": "It really did have nothing to do with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301005": "It was obvious that the Eclipsites attacked that place.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301006": "I can't let Charon take full responsibility for it.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301007": "The Eclipsites' attack was the direct cause.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301008": "But the Illumina will continue to launch further investigations.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301009": "What about Vice? Are you planning on taking her away with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_30301010": "Firstly, I'm not planning on leaving just yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301011": "Secondly, Vice has a mind of her own. I have approved her mission application. She will stay with you for now to help you resolve any future incidents that arise.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301012": "That's great...",
  "str_quest_chat_30301013": "Also, I'm sorry about your companions.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301014": "I hope you'll be able to buck up.",
  "str_quest_chat_30301015": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302001": "I don't know if these messages can be sent successfully...",
  "str_quest_chat_30302002": "The terminal system used for message transmission on the Mantiz lags all the time, so I hope it won't be too late by the time you get this message.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302003": "The reason I'm sending a message like this...",
  "str_quest_chat_30302004": "It's because I'll feel embarrassed if I tell you certain things directly through my psychic ability.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302005": "It feels more appropriate like this.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302006": "After all, I still don't know who you are, and I've never gotten to know you properly.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302007": "That being said, I'm really glad that someone can receive my psychic call for help.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302008": "I mean, my psychic ability is nowhere near good... Today was the first time I sensed anything other than horror scenes.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302009": "Sorry, I meant my kin...",
  "str_quest_chat_30302010": "To be honest, I've only ever run away from my duties and responsibilities.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302011": "But now that I think about it, I've never had a choice.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302012": "I once thought that I would have a chance once I ran away, but I was actually at the end of the path already by the time I realized it.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302013": "I hope you'll walk down a different path from mine.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302014": "Don't ever let others decide your worth.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302015": "I'm sorry to tell you all this as it might confuse you.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302016": "But please forgive me, because I'll need to meet you before I can decide if I can tell you about my duty.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302017": "So, all I can tell you now are things that seem both related and unrelated at the same time.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302018": "The truth is that I've always looked forward to seeing the outside world, yet in the end, I could only hide underground.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302019": "I hope you'll be my companion.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302020": "If you aren't, then just pretend I've never sent you this message.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302021": "But if you are, maybe we'll be able to defeat that Aviduz if we work together.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302022": "Maybe we'll be able to soar in the sky together! Right?",
  "str_quest_chat_30302023": "Sorry, I meant we'll be able to pilot the Colossus and make it fly in the sky.",
  "str_quest_chat_30302024": "I'm so sorry, Mendelson... I only got your message now...",
  "str_quest_chat_30302025": "I'm sorry I couldn't help you in the end...",
  "str_quest_chat_30302026": "But I'll inherit your duty and mission...",
  "str_quest_chat_30302027": "With your desires and everyone else's...",
  "str_quest_chat_30401001": "PlayerName, what do you think about Lower Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_30401002": "Are you referring to Shelt and Shire? They... To be honest, I think they're quite pitiful.",
  "str_quest_chat_30401003": "They probably didn't want to end up like that too.",
  "str_quest_chat_30401004": "But they were destined to die from the moment they infiltrated Lower Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_30401005": "I think there's no need to sympathize with them.",
  "str_quest_chat_30401006": "Hmm... What about Lower Lumopolis?",
  "str_quest_chat_30401007": "How do you feel about the relationship between Lower Lumopolis and Uptown?",
  "str_quest_chat_30401008": "Lower Lumopolis and the Uptown are two different worlds.",
  "str_quest_chat_30401009": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_30401010": "At least Lower Lumopolis is a part of Lumopolis...",
  "str_quest_chat_30401011": "At least it floats in the air, which is much better than Umbraton which is on the ground.",
  "str_quest_chat_30401012": "Hmm...",
  "str_quest_chat_30401013": "Carleen, why are you asking me this all of a sudden?",
  "str_quest_chat_30401014": "I just wanted to hear about this from a third party perspective.",
  "str_quest_chat_30401015": "I was thinking that it would probably be more objective.",
  "str_quest_chat_30401016": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_30402001": "Your Excellency, I'm the City Lord of Lumopolis, Daniel de Schwartz.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402002": "Oh, so you're the City Lord. H-hello.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402003": "You don't need to bother with the tedious etiquette of Lumopolis here.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402004": "Okay... In that case, what is the purpose of your visit?",
  "str_quest_chat_30402005": "Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402006": "Carleen? She...",
  "str_quest_chat_30402007": "She's my daughter, but I don't want others to only see her as my daughter.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402008": "This is what she wants as well.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402009": "What do you want me to do then...?",
  "str_quest_chat_30402010": "If she comes to Soroz, try not to treat her like my daughter when you interact with her.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402011": "I'm sure she'll agree with me.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402012": "Why...?",
  "str_quest_chat_30402013": "Because this is probably what Carleen wants the most, to rely on her ability as much as possible... and not on my help...",
  "str_quest_chat_30402014": "I see... I understand now.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402015": "I promise you, City Lord.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402016": "Thank you, PlayerName, for agreeing to my request. Please also keep this between us.",
  "str_quest_chat_30402017": "I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_30501001": "PlayerName, I think I need to apologize to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_30501002": "Oh, it's you? What's wrong?",
  "str_quest_chat_30501003": "You don't feel like the usual you...",
  "str_quest_chat_30501004": "Sigh, she wouldn't have been able to snatch that thing if you weren't trying to save me.",
  "str_quest_chat_30501005": "But... you tried your best already.",
  "str_quest_chat_30501006": "Didn't you attack her many times?",
  "str_quest_chat_30501007": "I don't think you did anything wrong.",
  "str_quest_chat_30501008": "Oh... really? Is that what you really think?",
  "str_quest_chat_30501009": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_30501010": "That's great! Thank you! You're the first person I'll invite to play if I come up with a new game—you can't say no!",
  "str_quest_chat_30501011": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_30501012": "What are you hesitating about?",
  "str_quest_chat_30501013": "Because I don't know what game you'll come up with...",
  "str_quest_chat_30501014": "No problem!",
  "str_quest_chat_30501015": "It'll definitely be a very fun game!",
  "str_quest_chat_30501016": "It'll be ready in the next few days!",
  "str_quest_chat_30501017": "No worries. I'm happy as long as you're happy.",
  "str_quest_chat_30501018": "Oh! It would be nice to make that part of the game's system. Let me think of a way to do that...",
  "str_quest_chat_30502001": "PlayerName, d-do you have any memories of your childhood?",
  "str_quest_chat_30502002": "What age are you thinking of?",
  "str_quest_chat_30502003": "When you were really, really young.",
  "str_quest_chat_30502004": "Not really then. What do you really want to ask me about, Vice?",
  "str_quest_chat_30502005": "I want to know about... your people.",
  "str_quest_chat_30502006": "As you know, I'm very curious about the past...",
  "str_quest_chat_30502007": "But I know absolutely nothing about the Caelestites.",
  "str_quest_chat_30502008": "Can you tell me whatever you know?",
  "str_quest_chat_30502009": "Sure.",
  "str_quest_chat_30502010": "Actually, I've only heard about it from Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_30502011": "Well... I don't seem to have any memories of those times.",
  "str_quest_chat_30502012": "I see...",
  "str_quest_chat_30502013": "In that case, let's search together for more information about the Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_30502014": "Because we're companions now.",
  "str_quest_chat_30502015": "You're right, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_30502016": "Now that you say that, I don't feel that lonely anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_30601001": "PlayerName, are you familiar with Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_30601002": "Of course! I've lived here for 17 years.",
  "str_quest_chat_30601003": "That's true...",
  "str_quest_chat_30601004": "Carleen, why are you asking?",
  "str_quest_chat_30601005": "I want to know more about Soroz.",
  "str_quest_chat_30601006": "Carleen, do you want to know more about Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_30601007": "Yes.",
  "str_quest_chat_30601008": "What do you want to know about Soroz specifically?",
  "str_quest_chat_30601009": "Are there still many secrets about Soroz that haven't been uncovered?",
  "str_quest_chat_30601010": "There should be.",
  "str_quest_chat_30601011": "Hmm... I think I need to come back a few more times.",
  "str_quest_chat_30601012": "After all, a Colossus like Soroz is quite rare...",
  "str_quest_chat_30601013": "Carleen, what's on your mind?",
  "str_quest_chat_30601014": "I'm thinking that we may need to depend on you and Soroz to keep Lumopolis safe...",
  "str_quest_chat_30602001": "Congratulations!",
  "str_quest_chat_30602002": "Oh? What's there to congratulate me about... That thing was snatched away in the end.",
  "str_quest_chat_30602003": "At least you're still alive.",
  "str_quest_chat_30602004": "The Whispering Corridor wasn't damaged that badly either.",
  "str_quest_chat_30602005": "Does the Whispering Corridor mean that much to you?",
  "str_quest_chat_30602006": "Yes, because that's our treasure chest and it contains the property of many.",
  "str_quest_chat_30602007": "That's true...",
  "str_quest_chat_30602008": "It's great that you understand, since the property of many is inside it.",
  "str_quest_chat_30602009": "Yes, it really is a treasure chest.",
  "str_quest_chat_30602010": "But it's also a maze.",
  "str_quest_chat_30602011": "Because that's the only way to prevent intruders from stealing our treasure.",
  "str_quest_chat_30602012": "But it still wasn't enough to stop them... For example, Schummer...",
  "str_quest_chat_30602013": "Oh, well...",
  "str_quest_chat_30602014": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_30602015": "Oh right, did you damage anything else?",
  "str_quest_chat_30602016": "You'll have to pay for it if you did.",
  "str_quest_chat_30602017": "I have to pay for this?",
  "str_quest_chat_30602018": "I can imagine what life was like for Dayna when she was under you...",
  "str_quest_chat_30602019": "They have such good temper... I can't believe they didn't turn on you...",
  "str_quest_chat_30701001": "PlayerName, will the damage to Soroz have any effect on you?",
  "str_quest_chat_30701002": "I think... there is some.",
  "str_quest_chat_30701003": "Sigh, I thought so too, since you've lived with him for 17 years.",
  "str_quest_chat_30701004": "Oh! Not at all. I'm doing great!",
  "str_quest_chat_30701005": "You didn't look well before. Don't force yourself.",
  "str_quest_chat_30701006": "You've lived with it for 17 years after all.",
  "str_quest_chat_30701007": "Yes, there's no physical impact, but it has affected me mentally...",
  "str_quest_chat_30701008": "You mean psychologically?",
  "str_quest_chat_30701009": "PlayerName, try not to think about it for now since... I'm here with you.",
  "str_quest_chat_30701010": "Ah, we're here with you!",
  "str_quest_chat_30701011": "We'll be here with you, so don't let that incident affect you. Just give us combat instructions like usual!",
  "str_quest_chat_30701012": "I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_30701013": "Thank you, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_30702001": "PlayerName, don't you think you should focus on training your willpower?",
  "str_quest_chat_30702002": "No need.",
  "str_quest_chat_30702003": "That won't do! What if Soroz gets hurt again? It might affect you!",
  "str_quest_chat_30702004": "Oh, why?",
  "str_quest_chat_30702005": "Because you're our commander in battle!",
  "str_quest_chat_30702006": "If your willpower is feeble, you could be susceptible to certain psychological effects...",
  "str_quest_chat_30702007": "It could lead to unquantifiable losses in battle!",
  "str_quest_chat_30702008": "Well... do you have any suggestions then?",
  "str_quest_chat_30702009": "I'll get the Illumina Federation Research Lab to develop a special medicine for you.",
  "str_quest_chat_30702010": "We've got the best therapists there.",
  "str_quest_chat_30702011": "Such as Chandra, whom you might have already met.",
  "str_quest_chat_30702012": "PlayerName, you should be careful even if there aren't any effects for now.",
  "str_quest_chat_30702013": "Thank you, Vivian.",
  "str_quest_chat_30801001": "I don't know if you could see this...",
  "str_quest_chat_30801002": "But after deliberation, I decided to send it.",
  "str_quest_chat_30801003": "I made an important decision.",
  "str_quest_chat_30801004": "Lumopolis rejected the proposal to activate Damocles.",
  "str_quest_chat_30801005": "But I'll do that on my own.",
  "str_quest_chat_30801006": "I told Vice I'd see her soon. Please pass on my apologies.",
  "str_quest_chat_30801007": "For I must bid you farewell.",
  "str_quest_chat_30801008": "When it all comes to pass, I'll accept my punishment, and probably never see you again.",
  "str_quest_chat_30801009": "When you see this, take Soroz out of the Lumopolis territory immediately.",
  "str_quest_chat_30801010": "As for Schummer and her black Colossus...",
  "str_quest_chat_30801011": "I vow on my honor to destroy it with the power of Lumopolis.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802001": "How do you feel, PlayerName?",
  "str_quest_chat_30802002": "Any problems after digging out the \"seed\"?",
  "str_quest_chat_30802003": "Yes",
  "str_quest_chat_30802004": "It hurts like hell.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802005": "Then I regret to inform you that the treatment isn't quite successful.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802006": "What?!",
  "str_quest_chat_30802007": "But don't worry. Rest is sufficient for your recovery.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802008": "No",
  "str_quest_chat_30802009": "Ah, looks like the treatment is a success.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802010": "Perhaps you should thank Vice for what she did.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802011": "There are things you must do for a full recovery.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802012": "Monitor the wound and clean it regularly.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802013": "No strenuous activities, but don't lie on the floor or bed doing nothing, either.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802014": "Maintain a simple diet and avoid spicy food.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802015": "Nourish yourself and get more sun.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802016": "Well...",
  "str_quest_chat_30802017": "That sounded like any typical post-injury care?",
  "str_quest_chat_30802018": "I'm not a doctor, but out of obligation toward you...",
  "str_quest_chat_30802019": "I must reiterate even the simplest cautions.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802020": "So, please take care of yourself until we meet again.",
  "str_quest_chat_30802021": "Goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat_30901001": "Hello? Hi, PlayerName. Do you read me? Hello? Hey!",
  "str_quest_chat_30901002": "I read you.",
  "str_quest_chat_30901003": "Wow! That was one fast reply! How goes it? Run into any trouble out there?",
  "str_quest_chat_30901004": "Nothing's come up yet.",
  "str_quest_chat_30901005": "That's what I like to hear! Plain sailing, all the way!",
  "str_quest_chat_30901006": "Well, we did only just set off not too long ago...",
  "str_quest_chat_30901007": "Y-You've got a point there, for sure! H-How's Carleen doing? What kind of mood has she been in?",
  "str_quest_chat_30901008": "Has she said anything about being unhappy, or anything like that...?",
  "str_quest_chat_30901009": "Ah, that's not right... Carleen would never use the word \"unhappy\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_30901010": "Erm, what are you trying to get at?",
  "str_quest_chat_30901011": "Well, you know, Carleen was punished recently...",
  "str_quest_chat_30901012": "She's been suspended from the Guardians for a year!",
  "str_quest_chat_30901013": "Sorry, I don't really know much about that. But that does raise a question...",
  "str_quest_chat_30901014": "If she's been suspended for a year, does that mean she'll automatically resume her position once the year's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_30901015": "No, no, no! Such an important post can't be resumed so easily!",
  "str_quest_chat_30901016": "Carleen's performance from now on, and how well she does during this mission...",
  "str_quest_chat_30901017": "Plus a whole load of factors—they all need to be taken into consideration! She'll only be able to rejoin the Guardians once her actions have been thoroughly reviewed!",
  "str_quest_chat_30901018": "But how the review works, exactly... Raphael doesn't quite know...",
  "str_quest_chat_30901019": "So... Maybe Carleen can treat this as a chance to take a break?",
  "str_quest_chat_30901020": "Being Captain of the Guardians, Carleen's probably used to running herself ragged every day, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_30901021": "There's no escaping hard work! Even Raphael has a lot to do most days.",
  "str_quest_chat_30901022": "But Carleen usually likes to hang out with the Guardians, most of the time.",
  "str_quest_chat_30901023": "Raphael doesn't think Carleen is interested in resting at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_30901024": "I think she's just very responsible, but that doesn't mean she never wants to take a break...",
  "str_quest_chat_30901025": "Anyway, I can tell you're worried that this suspension may have affected Carleen somehow.",
  "str_quest_chat_30901026": "So you asked me how she's doing, right?",
  "str_quest_chat_30901027": "Right! That's exactly it!",
  "str_quest_chat_30901028": "You and Carleen are pretty close. Maybe she'll open up to you...",
  "str_quest_chat_30901029": "She's the same as she's always been.",
  "str_quest_chat_30901030": "Carleen knew what the consequences of her actions would be, and she was prepared to face them.",
  "str_quest_chat_30901031": "I don't think she'd let this suspension weigh too heavily on her mind.",
  "str_quest_chat_30901032": "Thank goodness! Now Raphael doesn't have to worry anymore!",
  "str_quest_chat_30901033": "So now I can go report back to the City Lord and tell him what you said!",
  "str_quest_chat_30901034": "Huh? Report back to the City Lord...?",
  "str_quest_chat_30901035": "Huh? Ah... Raphael is supposed to report your whereabouts to the City Lord!",
  "str_quest_chat_30901036": "Hmm... It's just that you only set off not too long ago...",
  "str_quest_chat_30901037": "Huh? You need to give a report even though we've barely even begun?",
  "str_quest_chat_30901038": "Yeah! That's right! See ya!",
  "str_quest_chat_30902001": "PlayerName, what's the current situation?",
  "str_quest_chat_30902002": "We've made contact with Forsakin.",
  "str_quest_chat_30902003": "Oh!? Whatever you do, try not to get dragged into a battle!",
  "str_quest_chat_30902004": "She's managed to obtain some sort of power, which is beyond our comprehension... so you'd better avoid her for now!",
  "str_quest_chat_30902005": "We already had something of a confrontation...",
  "str_quest_chat_30902006": "What!? Is everyone alright? What about Vice!?",
  "str_quest_chat_30902007": "Well, maybe I should say we almost had a confrontation.",
  "str_quest_chat_30902008": "She didn't seem interested in fighting.",
  "str_quest_chat_30902009": "Don't worry, it didn't come to blows.",
  "str_quest_chat_30902010": "Well, Forsakin didn't actually fight us herself, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_30902011": "From what I saw last time, she really doesn't seem like the fighting type.",
  "str_quest_chat_30902012": "And that's what makes her so terrifying! You have to be more careful!",
  "str_quest_chat_30902013": "Can you find out what she's doing there?",
  "str_quest_chat_30902014": "Wait, never mind... You just make sure you stay safe, above all else!",
  "str_quest_chat_30902015": "I feel like... Forsakin doesn't see me as a threat.",
  "str_quest_chat_30902016": "She was odd enough to start off with, but now she's become even worse.",
  "str_quest_chat_30902017": "What kind of person is Forsakin, anyway?",
  "str_quest_chat_30902018": "Well, that would take quite some time to explain...",
  "str_quest_chat_30902019": "Ah, the doctor's here. My dressings need changing. That's all for now!",
  "str_quest_chat_30902020": "Remember—keeping yourself safe takes top priority! Nothing else matters!",
  "str_quest_chat_31001001": "Erm... Are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_31001002": "What's wrong, Bopper?",
  "str_quest_chat_31001003": "Nothing's wrong, I just wanted to check in on your situation.",
  "str_quest_chat_31001004": "It was a real mess back in Eraveil, and I have been busy salvaging whatever I could since then...",
  "str_quest_chat_31001005": "How are you feeling now?",
  "str_quest_chat_31001006": "Pretty good.",
  "str_quest_chat_31001007": "Well, at least one of your worries has been solved, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_31001008": "Sinsa's also itching for a fight—he asked us to search high and low for even the smallest trace of Forsakin.",
  "str_quest_chat_31001009": "It feels like things are getting better, and it's all because of you, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_31001010": "When we finally catch Forsakin, we'll invite you to the Rediesel Desert for a huge celebration feast!",
  "str_quest_chat_31001011": "... I'm confused.",
  "str_quest_chat_31001012": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_31001013": "Ah, right... I think I know what you mean.",
  "str_quest_chat_31001014": "To tell you the truth, I've also been wondering why Sinsa's making us search for Forsakin like this...",
  "str_quest_chat_31001015": "But the thing is, she's so darn sneaky... She didn't leave a single clue!",
  "str_quest_chat_31001016": "Anyway, if you're looking for some fun, you'll always be welcome in the Rediesel Desert!",
  "str_quest_chat_31001017": "We'll fill your belly with the most delicious food you've ever eaten!",
  "str_quest_chat_31001018": "You mean, real Rediesel Wrench delicacies?",
  "str_quest_chat_31001019": "That's right! We know everything there is to know about food!",
  "str_quest_chat_31001020": "The more intense a battle is, the more you have to eat afterward... and I hope you can hold your liquor, too!",
  "str_quest_chat_31001021": "By the end of the night, your mind will be free of all distractions, and you'll sleep like a baby!",
  "str_quest_chat_31001022": "So until then, try to get some rest, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_31001023": "Alright, Bopper.",
  "str_quest_chat_31001024": "Finally... Some decent rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002001": "Having a good rest?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002002": "Well, I was having a good rest...",
  "str_quest_chat_31002003": "Great!",
  "str_quest_chat_31002004": "You've been through so much recently, it'd be best if you just went to sleep as soon as possible.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002005": "Wait... I'm not interrupting your sleep, am I?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002006": "No, no, I'm still awake.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002007": "Well, as long as I'm not bothering you, let's talk awhile!",
  "str_quest_chat_31002008": "Alright then... What do you want to talk about?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002009": "I can rest later.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002010": "I'm not sure what you're so busy with right now, but remember to spare some time for a proper rest.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002011": "I know, I know.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002012": "Hey...",
  "str_quest_chat_31002013": "What's up?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002014": "Are you alright?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002015": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_31002016": "I'm fine, really. Don't worry about me.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002017": "Well, if you say so, I suppose I'll try not to worry about you.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002018": "But remember!",
  "str_quest_chat_31002019": "Uh... Remember what?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002020": "If there's anything on your mind... If there's anything getting you down, or any problem you need help with...",
  "str_quest_chat_31002021": "Just say the word, and I'll be there!",
  "str_quest_chat_31002022": "*Sigh* I knew you were still worried about me.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002023": "Alright then, I promise I'll come to find you when I need help.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002024": "Well, alright then! As long as you promise, I can rest easy!",
  "str_quest_chat_31002025": "Wait a minute. I'll pass you over to Carleen. I think she has something she wants to say to you!",
  "str_quest_chat_31002026": "Wait... Why is Carleen using your terminal?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002027": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_31002028": "This is Carleen.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002029": "I was standing beside, and she pulled me over.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002030": "Erm... Okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002031": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_31002032": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_31002033": "Carleen... How about you put Vice back on?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002034": "Being dragged in front of the terminal like that... If it were me, I wouldn't know what I'd say, either...",
  "str_quest_chat_31002035": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002036": "Huh?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002037": "I'm just thinking about how I should express myself.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002038": "I'd like to say... It has been a pleasure meeting you.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002039": "I rarely stray too far from Lumopolis. This journey is... special for me.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002040": "Great. I'm glad we met, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002041": "If you need help with anything in the future, you can count on me.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002042": "Alright, I will. Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002043": "But you should probably use your own terminal the next time you want to send me a message.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002044": "What if I get the two of you mixed up?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002045": "That won't happen. I'll always say, \"This is Carleen.\"",
  "str_quest_chat_31002046": "I'll return Vice's terminal to her. You two can continue talking.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002047": "I won't say \"This is Vice\" every time we talk, but I'm sure you'll be able to recognize me!",
  "str_quest_chat_31002048": "Stop sharing your terminal with other people!",
  "str_quest_chat_31002049": "All right, all right, I know, I know.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002050": "I won't make a habit of it.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002051": "You're looking a lot more animated than usual, so we won't bother you any further. Go and have a rest!",
  "str_quest_chat_31002052": "How can I rest when you've got me all worked up like this?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002053": "Cheer up and get some decent rest! You can do it... I believe in you!",
  "str_quest_chat_31002054": "So... I'll see you tomorrow, okay?",
  "str_quest_chat_31002055": "Come on... We're all on the Colossus. There's really no need to say \"see you tomorrow\"... I'll see you later.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002056": "But you two should rest up, too. On that point, we're in agreement...",
  "str_quest_chat_31002057": "Well... I'll see you tomorrow.",
  "str_quest_chat_31002058": "Right! See you tomorrow!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003001": "PlayerName, are you resting, meow?",
  "str_quest_chat_31003002": "Hi, Philyshy. It's been a while.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003003": "Right. But Philyshy has been watching you all this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003004": "What can I help you with today?",
  "str_quest_chat_31003005": "Philyshy wants to talk to you, PlayerName... Is that okay, meow?",
  "str_quest_chat_31003006": "Of course you can. I couldn't get to sleep, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003007": "Philyshy saw the report Vice submitted.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003008": "You've been really tired this whole time, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003009": "Really, I'm actually fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003010": "That's the spirit, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003011": "Philyshy was really worried about you at first.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003012": "But Philyshy is relieved to hear you're just fine.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003013": "Well, I've been a little tired...",
  "str_quest_chat_31003014": "Of course, after all, you've been through so much, and all at the same time...",
  "str_quest_chat_31003015": "But Philyshy knows that your hard work has been keeping everyone inspired, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003016": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003017": "You're welcome, of course!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003018": "The next time you come back to Illumina, I'll teach you some tips for getting to sleep quickly, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003019": "Alright. But...",
  "str_quest_chat_31003020": "It may be some time before I see you again.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003021": "PlayerName, what are your plans now, meow?",
  "str_quest_chat_31003022": "I need to recover Soroz's consciousness as soon as possible!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003023": "We'll it looks like you've found a way to fix the Echo Template, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003024": "Yeah... But there's still one problem...",
  "str_quest_chat_31003025": "What is it, meow?",
  "str_quest_chat_31003026": "Forsakin... We ran into Forsakin again, this time.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003027": "Forsakin once served Illumina...",
  "str_quest_chat_31003028": "Her name was Denier back then.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003029": "Do you know anything about her?",
  "str_quest_chat_31003030": "All Philyshy knows is that those who betray Illumina are stripped of their name.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003031": "Being forgotten by Illumina is the greatest punishment for a traitor.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003032": "And Philyshy doesn't remember the name you mentioned just now, meow.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003033": "So, you mean... Forsakin betrayed Illumina?",
  "str_quest_chat_31003034": "And Illumina took away her name!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003035": "Philyshy didn't say that, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003036": "Hmm... I think I understand.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003037": "Is that the time, meow!?",
  "str_quest_chat_31003038": "Philyshy won't keep you up any longer, PlayerName! Have a good rest!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003039": "Have a good night's sleep and you'll have an even better day's work, tomorrow!",
  "str_quest_chat_31003040": "Okay. Goodbye.",
  "str_quest_chat_31003041": "Bye!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101001": "PlayerName! It's Eve!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101002": "Did I send this thing?",
  "str_quest_chat_40101003": "Received, Eve.",
  "str_quest_chat_40101004": "Ah! Alright! Looks like we've made contact!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101005": "We're back in Tail Street!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101006": "You're back in the Rediesel Desert?",
  "str_quest_chat_40101007": "Yeah! We're already on Tail Street!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101008": "Eh? You need to go back to the isolation chamber?",
  "str_quest_chat_40101009": "No, no! There are a few things I need to pack, like those gifts everyone made for me before.",
  "str_quest_chat_40101010": "My brother insisted that someone else should come, but what do they know!? Girls should handle \"girl stuff\" themselves—",
  "str_quest_chat_40101011": "This girl's still very weak! Don't talk to her for too long!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101012": "That was Sinsa who snatched the terminal just now!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101013": "Some people really don't know how to spell \"gratitude\"...",
  "str_quest_chat_40101014": "That's not it. He was rattling on all the way about where we'd be if we didn't have a Caelestite.",
  "str_quest_chat_40101015": "No! That's not it at all!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101016": "You need to take care of yourself, Eve.",
  "str_quest_chat_40101017": "I know! But I'm almost fine now, even though they don't believe me.",
  "str_quest_chat_40101018": "Alright! That's enough for today! My sister needs a rest!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101019": "... Okay, Sinsa.",
  "str_quest_chat_40101020": "Dawn's not with you?",
  "str_quest_chat_40101021": "She's gonna stay in Red-Eye Gorge and tie up some loose ends. I guess she's still worried about those dawn flowers...",
  "str_quest_chat_40101022": "Maybe we can suggest that she move them to Rediesel Desert...?",
  "str_quest_chat_40101023": "I'll talk to her later! But let's end it for the day!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101024": "My head's still a little... achy... I'll go to sleep now!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101025": "Promise you'll come to visit me when you have time!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101026": "Okay, as long as Soroz won't be taken apart...",
  "str_quest_chat_40101027": "Hahaha! I'd never let Brother do that!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101028": "Alright. There are still a lot of unclear things about what happened back then...",
  "str_quest_chat_40101029": "Ah.",
  "str_quest_chat_40101030": "*Sighs* Brother's been going on about that, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_40101031": "Alrighty! Let me rest up a while before I start thinking about all these complicated things!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101032": "See ya, PlayerName!",
  "str_quest_chat_40101033": "And...",
  "str_quest_chat_40101034": "Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_40101035": "No problem, Eve.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201001": "Are you there?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201002": "I'm here.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201003": "This is no walk in the park. Caroline almost had us over a barrel more than once, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201004": "Although I don't really care about getting anything from this, thinking about it still makes me mad.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201005": "No.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201006": "How droll, PlayerName.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201007": "Ah, or perhaps you do not wish to talk to me? Still sulking about the Ocean Sovereign fiasco?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201008": "Well, I'm not happy about it either!",
  "str_quest_chat_40201009": "Those little rats dared to trick me and put everyone in danger!",
  "str_quest_chat_40201010": "Calm down. It's all over now, anyway.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201011": "That's right. There is nothing more we can do, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201012": "This was all so bizarre... Caroline, the Desolate Monarch...",
  "str_quest_chat_40201013": "So, you plan to go settle the score?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201014": "That's what I was thinking, but...",
  "str_quest_chat_40201015": "I have found something more interesting on which to ponder.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201016": "Do you know the legend of the Ocean Sovereign?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201017": "I think someone mentioned it before.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201018": "I wasn't really paying attention...",
  "str_quest_chat_40201019": "Long, long ago, a castle suddenly appeared in the sea, and the coast changed completely.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201020": "In order to protect his subjects, the king passed the trials of the three goddesses, all by himself.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201021": "But when he returned to the shore, the world had changed in his absence.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201022": "Of course, I already told you about it!",
  "str_quest_chat_40201023": "Right. You said the Ocean Sovereign would help Fleur with his little issue.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201024": "Well, let's just say I was speaking figuratively, no? It is only a legend.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201025": "But I will do my best to get him what I promised!",
  "str_quest_chat_40201026": "You really do enjoy putting yourself in these awkward situations...",
  "str_quest_chat_40201027": "Well, let's stay on topic, no? Did you know that there is another version of the legend of the Ocean Sovereign?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201028": "The trials were actually an Eclipsite plot, and the three goddesses were just powerful Eclipsites in disguise...",
  "str_quest_chat_40201029": "By the time the king has completed their requests, his subjects had already become Eclipsites.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201030": "Teetering on the brink of insanity, he chose to remain in that ominous castle, ruling over his fallen people forever...",
  "str_quest_chat_40201031": "This is one dark fairy tale...",
  "str_quest_chat_40201032": "Perhaps it is not a fairy tale, because long after this, the castle emerged once more.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201033": "Back then, it was the Caelestites and Aurorians who sealed it away at the bottom of the sea...",
  "str_quest_chat_40201034": "It was indeed a drawn-out and arduous battle.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201035": "Really? Why have I never heard of this before?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201036": "Well, this is considered by many to be nothing more than a legend. I went through many books surrounding the subject and couldn't find any further evidence.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201037": "But it explains the monarch's hatred of you and all Caelestite, no?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201038": "So, this is why I personally choose to believe that this battle took place.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201039": "Caelestites, huh? No wonder the Monarch hates me so much!",
  "str_quest_chat_40201040": "That's right. This is why he has such a fixation with the Caelestites.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201041": "Although this is just an unofficial history without much evidence to back it up at all, it explains a lot of things.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201042": "Of course, there are more questions that must be answered. For example, who is this Monarch and did he ever really exist?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201043": "So, here's my question. Regarding the legend of the Ocean Sovereign—",
  "str_quest_chat_40201044": "Which version do you believe? The beautiful and pure fairy tale, or the dark and cruel legend?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201045": "I believe the fairy tale.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201046": "Really? Even in a world like this, you still believe with such innocent ideals?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201047": "There are no fairy tales in this world.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201048": "Hmm? You suddenly seem so mature, striding across the pitfalls of credulity.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201049": "So you believe that if something sounds too good to be true, it usually not? And that reality is invariably cruel and dark?",
  "str_quest_chat_40201050": "Very interesting, PlayerName. You are indeed... very interesting.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201051": "I must find some time to visit you on the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_40201052": "It's settled... and I'm looking forward to it.",
  "str_quest_chat_40501001": "PlayerName, you've been quite busy lately.",
  "str_quest_chat_40501002": "You've defeated as many Eclipsites as my 1st Legion, and given that you're only a small unit... this achievement is all the more impressive.",
  "str_quest_chat_40501003": "Really?",
  "str_quest_chat_40501004": "You should believe in yourself!",
  "str_quest_chat_40501005": "But, Sharona, you're an Illumina Commander!",
  "str_quest_chat_40501006": "Command and actual combat are two very different things.",
  "str_quest_chat_40501007": "In short, I'll have to consider rewriting my evaluation on you.",
  "str_quest_chat_40501008": "Well, congratulations again on your great achievements.",
  "str_quest_chat_40501009": "T-Thank you.",
  "str_quest_chat_40501010": "It is we who should be thanking you.",
  "str_quest_chat_40501011": "On behalf of the Illumina Federation, I would like to thank you for your contribution to the Dunefire Line.",
  "str_quest_chat_40502001": "Hey! Good show, young friend! Much better than I could've done!",
  "str_quest_chat_40502002": "Ah... I suppose it was quite something.",
  "str_quest_chat_40502003": "But...",
  "str_quest_chat_40502004": "Don't be so modest!",
  "str_quest_chat_40502005": "Now that we have people like you among our ranks... Perhaps it's time for me to consider entering the fray once more.",
  "str_quest_chat_40502006": "The Stone Force?",
  "str_quest_chat_40502007": "Haha! If we reform the Stone Forces, we'll double our efficiency in fighting the Eclipsites. Are you interested?",
  "str_quest_chat_40502008": "I-I'll think about it.",
  "str_quest_chat_40502009": "Very well. Now, let's just focus on the battle at hand for the time being!",
  "str_quest_chat_40502010": "Right.",
  "str_quest_chat_40503001": "Too many... Too much...",
  "str_quest_chat_40503002": "What is it, Revy?",
  "str_quest_chat_40503003": "You've sliced up a lot of those Eclipsites maggots recently, even more than me... Yes, much, much more than me!",
  "str_quest_chat_40503004": "Erm... Right.",
  "str_quest_chat_40503005": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5... It's really too many, too much. I lost count.",
  "str_quest_chat_40503006": "It's okay, just don't count. You, erm, sliced up a lot, too.",
  "str_quest_chat_40503007": "I haven't been counting, anyway. Let's just say we sliced up about the same amount!",
  "str_quest_chat_40503008": "Yes! I'll persist in my patrol, then!",
  "str_quest_chat_40503009": "That's the spirit, Revy!",
  "str_quest_chat_40504001": "PlayerName, you've caught up already, meow!",
  "str_quest_chat_40504002": "Ah, Philyshy! So, you've heard...",
  "str_quest_chat_40504003": "Uh-huh! After all, I am the Intel Chief!",
  "str_quest_chat_40504004": "Amazing... It's like you know everything.",
  "str_quest_chat_40504005": "Hmm... Even so, it's a shame that nobody's gonna give me any fish jerky for it, meow.",
  "str_quest_chat_40504006": "N-No, don't worry! There will always be plenty of them waiting for you!",
  "str_quest_chat_40504007": "Really? Then Philyshy will have to gather a lot more intel...",
  "str_quest_chat_40504008": "A fine Intel Chief like you should have no problem on that.",
  "str_quest_chat_40504009": "But Philyshy wants to sleep now, meow...",
  "str_quest_chat_40504010": "Well... Go ahead.",
  "str_quest_chat_40505001": "Navigator! You've been working hard recently! Your Merit has shot through the roof!",
  "str_quest_chat_40505002": "But... don't neglect the importance of getting some decent rest! Have you been feeling tired recently?",
  "str_quest_chat_40505003": "Physically? I feel pretty good...",
  "str_quest_chat_40505004": "How about mentally?",
  "str_quest_chat_40505005": "Ah... I'm not entirely sure about that.",
  "str_quest_chat_40505006": "But I think I'm okay.",
  "str_quest_chat_40505007": "Well, just make sure you keep your stress levels low! Balancing work and rest is incredibly important!",
  "str_quest_chat_40505008": "Of course, if you're ever feeling down, you can come and see me any time!",
  "str_quest_chat_40505009": "I will!",
  "str_quest_chat_40601001": "...",
  "str_quest_chat_40601002": "Paloma?",
  "str_quest_chat_40601003": "Hmm... I seem to have messaged the right person.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601004": "The True Order's communication equipment is old and outdated. Heaven knows where they spend their budget, but it certainly isn't on technology.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601005": "Are you still in Eraveil? Is everything going well?",
  "str_quest_chat_40601006": "I've already returned to the Colossus.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601007": "Is Soroz currently docked outside Eraveil? To tell you the truth, that's quite considerate.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601008": "So, you all live up there, and use it to travel around?",
  "str_quest_chat_40601009": "Anyway, I'll pay a visit myself when I get a chance... as long as that Wayne isn't there...",
  "str_quest_chat_40601010": "Anyway, rest well and make sure you stay out of other people's heads.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601011": "The Post has been restored to working condition!",
  "str_quest_chat_40601012": "Yes, I know. I saw the lights and couriers when I left Eraveil.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601013": "It was beautiful, albeit a little excessive.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601014": "But you should cherish it—all of it. You are different from me. You still have many... things precious to you.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601015": "What right do I have to preach? I lived most of my life under the influence of Lumopolis society.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601016": "That's enough of that. I have something to take care of.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601017": "Well, then. Enjoy the festival.",
  "str_quest_chat_40601018": "And you...? Will you be alright?",
  "str_quest_chat_40601019": "Are you still tracking down Mirren?",
  "str_quest_chat_40601020": "Paloma? Are you still there?",
  "str_quest_chat_40601021": "Paloma?",
  "str_quest_chat_40901001": "PlayerName, I have a report to write. Please leave me a message if you need anything!",
  "str_quest_chat_40901002": "Vice...",
  "str_quest_chat_40901003": "I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.",
  "str_quest_chat_40901004": "But I'm certain I know what evil is.",
  "str_quest_chat_40901005": "I'll find the answer someday... I know I will.",
  "str_quest_chat_40901006": "I assure you.",
  "str_quest_chat_41201001": "PlayerName, you don't seem very happy recently.",
  "str_quest_chat_41201002": "Is it because of what happened in the undercity?",
  "str_quest_chat_41201003": "Did Butler remind you of Soroz?",
  "str_quest_chat_41201004": "Yes, you are absolutely right.",
  "str_quest_chat_41201005": "Don't worry. Soroz will recover sooner or later.",
  "str_quest_chat_41201006": "No matter what, Soroz is always here with us.",
  "str_quest_chat_41201007": "You know you can talk to me about anything.",
  "str_quest_chat_41201008": "Friends are who you can tell and trust.",
  "str_quest_chat_41201009": "Don't keep everything inside.",
  "str_quest_chat_41201010": "Thank you, Vice.",
  "str_quest_chat_41201011": "You are right. I have many friends now.",
